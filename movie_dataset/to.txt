They do to
She okay
Wow
No
Like my fear of wearing pastels
What good stuff
Thank God If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure
What crap
No
You always been this selfish
Then that 's all you had to say
You never wanted to go out with 'me did you
I looked for you back at the party but you always seemed to be occupied
Have fun tonight
You know Chastity
Hi
So that 's the kind of guy she likes Pretty ones
She 's not a
I really really really wan na go but I ca n't Not unless my sister goes
Eber 's Deep Conditioner every two days And I never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
You 're sweet
I counted on you to help my cause You and that thug are obviously failing Are n't we ever going on our date
Where
Well there 's someone I think might be
Forget French
I do n't want to know how to say that though I want to know useful things Like where the good stores are How much does champagne cost Stuff like Chat I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone
C'esc ma tete This is my head
Gosh if only we could find Kat a boyfriend
Unsolved mystery She used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
Seems like she could get a date easy enough
Cameron
Forget it
Okay then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine Saturday Night
Well I thought we 'd start with pronunciation if that 's okay with you
I did
I do n't have to be home 'til two
All I know is I 'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey
Bianca I do n't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding
Is he oily or dry
Would you mind getting me a drink Cameron
Joey
Where did he go He was just here
No
You know the deal I can t go if Kat does n't go
You 're concentrating awfully hard considering it 's gym class
Hey sweet cheeks
Neat
Queen Harry
Hopefully
Expensive
Perm
It 's just you
No I just wanted
I just wanted
Let go
You looked beautiful last night you know
Not all experiences are good Bianca You ca n't always trust the people you want to
I guess I thought I was protecting you
That 's not
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
After that I swore I 'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it And I have n't since Except for Bogey 's party and my stunning gastro-intestinal display
Just once Afterwards I told him I did n't want to anymore I was n't ready He got pissed Then he broke up with me
He said everyone was doing it So I did it
Now I do Back then was a different story
He was like a total babe
In 9th For a month
Joey never told you we went out did he
I do care But I 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else s
Listen I know you hate having to sit home because I 'm not Susie High School
I do n't get you You act like you 're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here
Bianca I need to talk to you I need to tell you
You are so completely unbalanced
It 's Shakespeare Maybe you 've heard of him
At least I 'm not a clouted fen sucked hedge-pig
Bogey Lowenstein 's party is normal but you 're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that
You 're ruining my life Because you wo n't be normal I ca n't be normal
What do you think
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we 're going
Can you at least start wearing a bra
Nowhere Hi Daddy
I have a date Daddy And he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
Fine I see that I 'm a prisoner in my own house I 'm not a daughter I 'm a possession
He 's not a hot rod Whatever that is
No but
Daddy I want to discuss the prom with you It 's tomorrow night
Why
Just for a minute
Wear the belly before you go
Oh God It 's starting
Daddy people expect me to be there
Otherwise known as an orgy
And where 're you going
Exactly my point
But it 's not fair she 's a mutant Daddy
What if she never starts dating
Now do n't get upset Daddy but there 's this boy and I think he might ask
Padua girls One tall decent body The other one kinda short and undersexed
Fan of a fan You see a couple of minors come in
Always a pleasure Brucie
You humiliated the woman Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score
Buttholus extremus But hey you 're making progress
Extremely unfortunate maneuver
You told me that part already
Assail your ears for one night
He 's pretty
Her favorite uncle
Number one She hates smokers
Will Bogey get bent
This is it A golden opportunity Patrick can ask Katarina to the party
You got him involved
I thought you hated those people
That 's what I just said
Forget his reputation Do you think we 've got a plan or not
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology
He seems like he thrives on danger
You wan na go out with him
Unlikely but even so she still ca n't go out with you So what 's the point
The mewling rampalian wretch herself
Yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew
You mean I 'd get a chance to talk to her
Sure do my Mom 's from Canada
Joey Dorsey Perma-shit-grin I wish I could say he 's a moron but he 's number twelve in the class And a model Mostly regional stuff but he 's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
Because they 're bred to Their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them Their gene pool is rarely diluted
I could start with your haircut but it does n't matter She 's not allowed to date until her older sister does And that 's an impossibility
Bianca Stratford Sophomore Do n't even think about it
You burn you pine you perish
Yeah but these guys have never seen a horse They just jack off to Clint Eastwood
Couple thousand Most of them evil
Get out
How many people were in your old school
I was kidding People actually live there
So which Dakota you from
So they tell me
You get the girl
Where
You makin any headway
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns That 's a direct quote
What 'd you do to her
Sure
She 's partial to Joey not me
It 's off The whole thing
Do n't make me do it man
So what does that give me I 'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who ca n't play their instruments
I 've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you 'll find helpful
Yeah we 'll see
And why would I do that
Your sister here
Where ya goin
Hey do you mind
Yeah and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow Tough break
Enough with the Barbie n Ken shit I know
Get her to act like a human
How 'd you do it
It 's about time
Forget it
What
I got her under control She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
I 'm on it
Fifty and you 've got your man
Fine thirty
How much
You 're gon na pay me to take out some girl
But you 'd go out with her if you had the cake
You just said
Yeah whatever I want you to go out with her
What do you think
Hey it 's all for the higher good right
What We took bathes together when we were kids
Uh yeah We 're old friend
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who 'll go out with her Someone who 's up for the job
But she ca n't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her right
Well actually I thought I 'd run an idea by you You know just to see if you 're interested
Nope just came by to chat
Hey
William he asked me to meet him here
Have you seen him
You re looking at this from the wrong perspective We 're making a statement
Listen to you You sound like Betty all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica
Can you even imagine Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
You did n't
You did n't have a choice Where 's Kat and what have you done with her
You went to the party I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
What 'd he say
You think this 'll work
Does it matter
Neither has his heterosexuality
William did n't even go to high school
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated puking frat boy number one golf team school I have no say at all
The people at this school are so incredibly foul
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions You 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy
What 's this
Mandella eat Starving yourself is a very slow way to die
He always look so
That 's Pat Verona The one who was gone for a year I heard he was doing porn movies
Who 's that
Oh Bianca Can you get me my freshman yearbook
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
Is that right
I thought you could use it When you start your band
I did n't care about the money
It was n't like that
Wait I
That s completely adorable
What
Look I 'm sorry that I questioned your motives I was wrong
It 's just something I had You know
How 'd you get a tux at the last minute
Answer the question Patrick
You tell me
Create a little drama Start a new rumor What
Why not
No what
You know what I mean
Go to the prom with me
No one else knows
You 're sweet And sexy And completely hot for me
I hate peas
I know the porn career 's a lie
The duck
State trooper
You up for it
How
Something like that
I do n't like to do what people expect Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
Acting the way we do
Yeah well do n't let it get out
I dazzled him with my wit
Good call
The Partridge Family
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down
Put your right foot there
C'mon It 's not that bad
Look up sunshine
Other than my upchuck reflex Nothing
Do n't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
Unwelcome
Pleasant
I heard there was a poetry reading
Excuse me have you seen The Feminine Mystique I lost my copy
BIANCA
He just wants me to be someone I 'm not
I 'm gettin there
You do n't strike me as the type that would ask permission
Start a band
Do what
Why 'd you lie
No you were n't
Were you in jail
When you were gone last year where were you
And I 'm in control of it
Kat Wake up
I thought you were above all that
I know It 'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila You do n't seem like the type
Dorsey
Why 'd you let him get to you
See that Who needs affection when I 've got blind hatred
Because then I 'd have to start taking out girls who like me
Sure I do
I told you
Leave it to you to use big words when you 're shitfaced
What if you have a concussion My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable Not that I could tell the difference
Uh uh You lie down and you 'll go to sleep
You 're not okay
Okay
I say do what you wan na do
What 's this
You know who The Raincoats are
Do you mind You 're sort of ruining it for me
Excuse me
hey Great show huh
You 're not a big talker are you
I was in the laundromat I saw your car Thought I 'd say hi
Seven-thirty
Come on the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
Then say you 'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me
You hate me do n't you
Like where The 7-Eleven on Burnside Do you even know my name screwboy
Oh right Friday
My mission in life
Sweating like a pig actually And yourself
Oh Christ Do n't tell me you 've changed your mind I already sent 'em a check
You know fathers do n't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives It means we 've become spectators Bianca still lets me play a few innings You 've had me on the bleachers for years When you go to Sarah Lawrence I wo n't even be able to watch the game
What 's the matter Upset that I rubbed off on her
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy
Parts of it
No Daddy
Funny
Was that your sister
You 're eighteen You do n't know what you want You wo n't know until you 're forty-five and you do n't have it
As a parent that 's my right
Why ca n't we agree on this
Is this about Sarah Lawrence You punishing me
My insurance does not cover PMS
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips
I thought we decided you were going to school here At U of 0
PERKY Just smack her now
PERKY No I believe heinous bitch is the term used most often
PERKY The point is Kat people perceive you as somewhat
PERKY Well yes compared to your other choices of expression this year today 's events are quite mild By the way Bobby Rictor 's gonad retrieval operation went quite well in case you 're interested
PERKY Katarina Stratford My my You 've been terrorizing Ms Blaise again

Hey there Tired of breathing

I 'm likin you guys better
Yeah
Just for now
Good enough
We 're your guys
Patrick Pat you 're not looking at the big picture Joey 's just a pawn We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl
That 's where we can help you With Kat
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron 's love is pure Purer than say Joey Dorsey 's
The situation is my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford
Whatever the hell it is you 're standin there waitin to say
Say it
PERKY You 're completely demented
PERKY You were n't abused you are n't stupid and as far as I can tell you 're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you 're such a fuck-up
PERKY Why do n't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid
Touch of the flu
PERKY With the teeth of your zipper
PERKY It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls
That s what I thought
Did I have anything to say about it
What just happened
Have a great time honey
What do you wan na watch We 've got crap crap crap or crap
They 'll dance they 'll kiss they 'll come home Let her go
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral
Tumescent
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country
Make anyone cry today
Ca n't be that far I say Also I do n't like the smell of the sea around here Smells like a cunt Bad sign
We should have seen land
He 's the devil 's child
Ah leave him alone He 's doing no harm
You 'll be drinking your own piss For the glory of Spain and Admiral Colon Bastard
I never seen heat like this Not even in Las Minas
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it
Do n't you realize your words could be considered heretical
If God intended our proximity to Asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
Is that all that interests you Gold
If they agree to follow me yes
Your Eminence there is only one way to settle the matter And that is to make the journey I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible
Senor Colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment
I am Your Eminence
Yes your Eminence The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
A waste Let me tell you something Arojaz If your name or mine is ever remembered it will only be because of his
You can see for yourself
It wo n't be easy to get rid of your prophet now Don Sanchez
He is a mercenary Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions
The Judgment is ours
I ca n't keep my eyes off you I would like to catch up with all the moments I did n't spend with you
I am busy inside
Not everything Do you think I care I 'm a free man again Riches do n't make a man rich they only make him busier
They tried but I did n't let them
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service
Beatrix I want to ask you something
I do n't want you to wait for me
Thank God
I find that hard to believe
I 'd love to argue with you sometimes But you 're never here
Well that 's true I have a child by a man who wo n't marry me Who 's always leaving
I know
I am afraid this is not the worst news
I am not a seaman But I heard it is no more than a week at sea I hope you are not too disappointed
Congratulations Then I am free to search for the mainland
Appointment to what
Yes I remember
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon
Forgive me Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
I want you to tell me everything you remember Father From the beginning Everything
He asks when he can come to visit you He left his address
I am not listening Father But I ca n't help hearing
There must be a passage to that other ocean
Not bad
This time with me
Yes Yes I do On all of them
You promise Do you swear on St Christopher
I want to go with you
Roofs towers palaces spires
Look out of that window
Call them
To rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation A little hypocrisy goes a long way
You seem to have a special talent for making friends
Don Bobadilla is already a judge my Dear Don Cristobal
for a commoner
Forgive me Don Colon But what about gold
If you wo n't accept our proposal we 'll simply find someone who will
Then you are too ambitious
I remind you Senor Colon that you are in no position to bargain with me
No
You never learned how to speak my language
You did the same to your God
Ask him if he will help
We will work with his people We want peace Ask the Chief if he understands
Chief says
Chief says he has a God
Why
Chief says how many
Chief knows
You come You speak first
What is it A tribe An island
I do n't know I have the impression that I did n't change that much I still ca n't accept the world as it is
New worlds create new people
I have to disagree
I suppose we 're both old men now
I believed in you
My son my son Your certitudes are sometimes frightening Christopher you must speak to them And if you do n't I will
May God forgive you You must tell them You must tell your men
How long
What are you saying
I am listening my son
In Nomine Patris et Filius et Spiritus Sancti
All of them Just lies
Colon
If God intends you to go then you will go
You must n't give way to despair You must wait
I 've been contradicted all my life Eternity
Passion is something one can not control
I 'll try to remember that Marchena
So was Christ
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr Esdras
Ignorance I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands
To open a new route to Asia At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
With some difficulty I had to promise them you were not a total fool
That 's what it says
Father I am doing what I think is the best for him And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself
Your Majesty some men are content to read about things I must see them with my own eyes I can not be other than I am
Thank you
They come and go as naked as the day God created them
Thirty seven Your Majesty And you
A woman
You show no inclination to speak otherwise
Surely you can do anything you want
That she was impregnable
The ocean is uncrossable
I should not even be listening to you since my council said no But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity And Sanchez that you are not a fool
You 'll be held in detention deprived of your privileges and possessions Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged Have you anything to say
In one act of brutality you have created chaos Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us All that because of your criminal savagery
Don Moxica we all have to work
We ca n't raise the wheel without it
We do n't need to know
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders you 'll do as I say
The Indians have no such word Don Moxica
We ca n't be
What 's he doing
What do you read
Well I surely know what a quadrant is But I 've never seen it used at night before
Well It 's the men Sir They wonder how you know our position We 've lost sight from land days ago
Due west Captain Mendez And may God be with us
You tell that to them
You bloody
Jesus Maria I should have never listened to you
You do n't know anything Listen Colon these are my ships right So I 'm telling you we 're turning back
We 're lost
We 're on the verge of a mutiny Colon
You must be mad
You lied You cheated We 're way past 750 leagues
Where can I meet this man
Then why
And who would you think of for such a task
Then what do you suggest Don Sanchez
But there is worse He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying But with no gold The new world proves expensive Your Majesty
Into a monk
You were right Don Sanchez His demands could never be granted
Is that the man I knew Treasurer Sanchez
so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital
I 'm abused Do n't you think
Out on my back when I was a small boy
That 's what he did to me He put cigarettes out on me
Your father blamed you for your mother 's blindness
Back in the Czech Republic
Your mother was blind
Tell me about yourself What you did as a young boy what your parents were like
I need to know about your background I need to know about your upbringing Why you 're here
This is not about money Emil I need your trust in me
But it 's
I would say half Half is fair
Look I have n't really focused on that kind of thing
Do n't worry about him Think about yourself
Disappeared They 're looking everywhere Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia
Well you did n't appreciate the severity of it until recently No question about that
delusions and paranoia
You bring the cigarettes
I 'm invoking rights this man is represented by counsel I 'm coming with him
I 'm coming with you
Do n't say anything
Emil Take it easy Stay with me Sit down What do you need What are you looking for
Here I have your money
Are you my attorney I 'm Emil I 'm insane

Forget about me You have enough problems of your own
What are you doing
I 'll make some for us
Do you have coffee
You better get packed
No matter what happens I 'm glad I met you
If you were my boyfriend I 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail ten-thousand miles away
Ludwig He 's gay are you jealous
I 'm sorry

They 're not gon na send you right back
I know
I 'm just trying to find out who you are
So you were never a prostitute
No

Yes I considered it
Yeah This way
The men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires
I ca n't take you to my place
Divorced
They wo n't until this is over
If you cooperate with the DA maybe they 'll help you with your situation
Yes but he was a cop
my little sister and I shared a flat I came home one night and a man was raping her His gun was on the chair He came at me and I shot him
Look we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here Tell us the truth is that the truth
A cop

Chief I know I screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian
What was I supposed to do The guy tried to mug me I was gon na send a cop back I just forgot
Okay But not water sports
Oh really That 's nice You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot Are you out of your fucking mind Are you having that much trouble gettin dates

I came to see how the investigation was going I called and you 're not here I wait up at the station and you do n't even show up I beep you you do n't return my call Where the hell have you been
'Cause we got more important things to do like finding out who did it
Who do you think Chief
Yeah
Yeah He finished awhile ago
You do that wiseguy Now let 's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does
What was that Korfin
Do n't you guys understand It 's all about image The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime
He got my gun Motherfucker was filming the whole time
Are you hit
The other side of the street The guy with the videocamera Do n't look put her in the car Stay this side

Still unknown but we 're running prints Kid over there caught the case
Takin a bath
A timer
You ready

Daphne Another guy came in asking me about her too
Boy she 's so popular all the sudden
No
Yeah He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there you know it does n't really matter Honey was killed Poor girl
We do n't have her I.D yet but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel
Homicide Miss Hearn It 's Detective Eddie Flemming Open up
Police We 'd like to ask you a few questions
You know I do n't know I like you You remind me of a puppy I used to have He pissed on the rug all the time but I still kept him
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer Here here 's a number of an Immigration lawyer That 's how you help her But you ca n't get involved in her like that You 're gon na jeopardize your career your life and you 're gon na jeopardize my case And lem me give you another piece of advice Maybe you do n't watch TV but I 'll let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin world watches television And when you get out there they know your face And the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job And I get more done because of it
Well it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not Do n't you understand that 's why you 're a professional
No I do n't think you were a fool I just think you were stupid about it I mean to say the least you outta know better You do n't know her well enough She 's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her it 's fuckin over You can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference You 're dead
Just a shower
Well you shoulda because nobody 's gon na believe you did n't including me
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs
Okay tell you what I 'll give you a head start You take her to the station house Do n't let her out of your sight She 's the only warm body we got left
You 're her Savior Is she the kid you 're gon na save from the burning building
So am I
My point exactly
What would your girlfriend think of that
You wan na talk to her alone
Raw deal
Something back home

Who says she 's a suspect
Hmmmm
The Super said he 'd seen her before but she did n't live here
If you found me steppin on your crime scene it might piss you off too What about the report
Did you get a report from the M.E
I do n't even watch TV
Well just so you know I do n't care about that stuff
Nah I musta missed it

Smarter than Americans You 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long Not only will Americans believe me they 'll cry for me So Detective Eddie Flemming would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette Maybe you can propose to her now

Capra That 's not Czech or Russian Who said he sounded Russian
GELLER That does n't apply to me because I 'm not a criminal I 'm not a criminal I was n't convicted
GELLER We 're in negotiations that 's correct
GELLER Look I 'm in here You call this a career move
GELLER Look I 'm a victim here too I was a year away from getting my masters in Art now I 'll never graduate My life has been permanently disrupted
GELLER It was my finger that pulled the trigger but I 'm not morally responsible My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of How could I know I 'm not a doctor
GELLER Yes My psychiatrist did n't insist that I stay on my medication
GELLER This had nothing to do with shoes that did n't fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor

SPACE STATTION 5 LOUNGE
I think I 'll have to go out and burn them off
I guess you do n't know your own strength old boy
Well now that we 've got one that 's actually failed we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it
Yes
Well I hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those Other wise we 're out of business
Two units in four days How many spares do we have
No
Well Hal 's reported the AO-unit about to fail again
Are you reasonably awake
Anyway it 's just as well that we replace it Better safe than sorry
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong
Well that 's something
I guess it is n't
But not completely inconceivable
Yes but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us
That 's true
How
Yes I thought so
I do n't know All I heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told
No as a matter of fact I did n't
Oh
I suppose the idea was specialized training
I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
Well what do you think we ought to do about it
Not really They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall and that we 're being charged against differ ent accounting offices
Yes
Interesting that you mention it because I 've got the same problem
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left
It 's about my salary cheques
Well it 's nothing really important but it 's annoying
Dave if you 've a minute I 'd like your advice on something
Okay
Hi Frank coming in please
I know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now Dave but it would be a crying shame since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and I have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
Hal unless you follow my instructions I shall be forced to disconnect you
Hal I 'm in command of this ship I order you to release the manual hibernation control
I do n't like to assert myself Dave but it would be much better now for you to rest You 've been involved in a very stressful situation
Look Dave your 've probably got a lot to do I suggest you leave it to me
If you 're determined to revive the crew now I can handle the whole thing myself There 's no need for you to trouble
It does n't have to be Hal It 's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth Let me have manual control please
The antenna has to be replaced
I suppose you 're pretty broken up about it
Too bad about Frank is n't it
Yes it is Hal
And do n't you worry about it
I 'm sorry about the misunderstanding Hal
Okay Hal well let 's see the way things go from here on
Hal is there anything bothering you Anything that might account for this problem
Yes I know that But I can assure you that they were about to fail
Yes I know
Sure Dave what 's up
I understand Hal We 'll take care of it Please let me have the hard copy
MY F.P.C shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
Sorry to interrupt the festivities Dave but I think we 've got a problem
I 'm sorry Frank but I do n't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know

'Bye 'bye now sweetheart
I 'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I 'll see you soon All right Darling
Okay sweetheart Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow
How many days until you come home
She 's in the bathroom
Mommy 's out to the hair dresser
In three days darling I hope
No I 'm sorry darling I told you I wo n't be home for a few days
Yes I know that sweetheart
I 'm fine Daddy When are you coming home
I 'll bet it 's a fortune
Yes well whatever it is they 're certainly not fooling around This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
Well how 's it going back there
Oh thank you very much
Well Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you
No thank you and I 'm afraid now I really must be going
Well that does sound very odd
Well where are all of you off to
How is gregor
Oh she 's growing up very fast As a matter of fact she 's six tomorrow
Yes it 's coming along very well
Yes I think so Just about then
Well shall we go through Documentation
Well Did you have a pleaant flight
Well thank you very much for being so understanding
How do you do Mr Miller
This epidemic could easily spread to our base Dr Floyd We should be given all the facts
Certainly
Well I 'm glad about that
Yes Well I hope the crew got back safely
I see
You mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
Yes Well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
Well it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius
Yes as a matter of fact I am
Well as it happens I 'm on my way up to the moon
Are you quite sure
I do n't think it has but I 'd like to check that Simpson what 's the log on that
Well not really At first glance black would suggest something sun-powered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
Tomb shine survey-marker spare part take your choice
Not really It 's completely inert No sound or energy sources have been detected The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it A laser drill
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
Yes it does The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
Dr Floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
No of course Captain I can understand your concern
Yes well I would n't have been too concerned about it except I 've heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact I 've heard that ten people have died already
Well I 'll tell you why I ask You see I 've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears I 'm a little concerned about her
I see
What do you mean
Thank you
We 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours Is there anything we can do for you
There 's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
All right Hal We 'll take care of it Let me have the hard copy please
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault
I know you did Frank but I assure you there was an impending failure
Yes Hal what 's up
Pod Bay is decompressed All doors are secure You are free to open pod bay doors
Roger
I understand
Five by five Frank
Hal have pod arms secure the component
That 's true
That 's true
That 's true
Our transit time is 257 days Is that true
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn True or false
Right Hal tell me whether the following statements are true or false
That we do And we put air in the tires I 'll even sell you some gas if you need it
We do n't wash 'em ya know
This is three years old
Name
Yeah
I 'm tellin ya I 'm giving you all I know
I do n't give a damn about his girl
Maybe I better ask around see what your pals think
Now how 's your memory doin
Maybe you better have a Black Russian
Yeah
Hey what about me
Maybe that 's where I 'm gon na cut your throat
They always let me do anything I do n't want to pay for it I never paid for it in my life
I never paid for it in my life
Pay money

I ai n't tired yet
You got a real big mouth convict
Now you 're talkin See ya
Hey no I 'm tryin to be nice Buy yourself something pretty I 'd do it but I got to go I got this cop waitin for me
Here you go baby
Hello again
Well maybe I 'll see you later
What 's the matter with my place
You just quit bein a priest or somethin
You 're in a hurry
Hey do n't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin it on
No I go to a school to learn how to do hair It 's a government program But really I want to be a model and I am definitely not sellin
Hey what kind of talk is that
I 'm candy
Where 's ganz
No chance
Yeah Sure i 'm crazy in love with him who would n't be
No time for any of that crap any more lady I 'll rip your lungs out if you do n't answer fast
I hear you 've got visitors
How about it
I said police Now drop the goddamn gun
You 're done End of story
Whaddya mean I got your gun I got his money I got everything
After I get outta this cop I 'm gon na live forever
You lying son of a bitch
Thanks
No you do n't If I ever get word of you steppin over the line again I 'm gon na ventilate that suit of yours
That 's right Not my style Reggie
It 's your money It 'll be here in six months when you get out
Wait a minute Cates I 've been waitin three years for that I do n't think it 's fair man What about the merit system You were gonnna give me a few thousand
Okay reggie start bustin my chops Tell me how great you were with that chick
Yeah But I was n't there for a second
Well you got to admit we come a long way
Yeah and I know Ganz sure ai n't no sweetheart I would n't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started
If we run into Billy first let me try and talk him in
Hey there she is
What if your girl 's theory turns out to be bullshit I mean they could be in Rio de Janeiro
Do I get to kiss her too
Yeah well the only woman of the Indian 's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet They both looked mad enough to kill him
It 's late they 're closing
Naw you did n't let me down It was a long shot all the way We gave 'em a good run at it
I do n't know about you but I could use a drink I 'll buy you one It 'll be my good-bye present
I had it impounded Come on we 'll use it for haulin you back to the slam
Yeah It missed the last four stops
Luther 's on the move
When you been in prison three years it do n't take long Let 's go
I can just take her right across the street to Luther 's hotel All I need is some money for the room
Yeah Guess not
Thanks for callin in and I guess Maybe Look I 'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger those kinds of things I was just leanin on ya doin my job
I do n't know why but I 'm going to let you keep it Maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because I 'm too tired to argue
Tell me something Why did n't you just take the money off Luther and split
They must have set up a meeting for the morning Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the Do n't Disturb sign He 's trading his girl for the money All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit
We missed
What about Luther
Be polite Say hello This is Candy
I 'll be there in a minute You do n't move your ass right
No way
Bullshit Then i 'm staying with the money
That was in style a couple years back man
We 're getting too close Cates what 's the matter you been takin dumb pills
No class
You know I 'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you 've done with this job
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz 'll give him a piece of your money
I 'm not in this 'cause it 's fun I 'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either I do it 'cause it works
If they do n't tell me what I need to know
That ai n't philosophy That 's common sense
I suppose you 'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you
I 'm tellin you the man 's in love he wants to be a hero for his girl
Tryin to save his girl man He 's in another world
I had no choice Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac
Jesus Christ look at all the dust on my car why in the hell do n't he take it to a car wash
Musta got some primo bondsman
Guess what Luther just got in line
You took a big chance leaving this here all this time
I was n't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice Jack
You just drove by it
This 'll show you how smart I am I got it parked
Where 's the goddamn car
Get this We ai n't partners We ai n't brothers We ai n't friends If Ganz gets away with my money you 're gon na be sorry we ever met
In the trunk of a car A lot better than under a mattress right
Depends on how things work out I believe in the merit system So far you have n't built up any points
Not likely convict
You catch on real fast Okay Jack let 's talk deal How much of my money you gon na let me keep
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale It 's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen I was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job Some psycho who 's out there capping people with some cop 's gun
Jesus
How much
One thing 's for sure Jack That 's how you 'll tell the story
Naw you 'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
Who gives a Goddamn what you think You 're just a crook that 's got a weekendpass You 're not even a name anymore Just a spear chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock 's runnin
You Do n't make me laugh You ca n't take care of shit You 've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt All you 're good for is games So far what I got outta you is nothin
This sucks A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it So instead of me being where I oughta be which is in bed giving my girl the high hard one I 'm out here doing this shit roaming around with some overdressed charcoal-colored loser like you
Let 's go
Must be billy 's girl
While you 're at it You can give me the switchblade too
Some of us citizens are with you all the way Officer
My kind of place I always liked country boys
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes
The bet 's off
You tell me what Ganz busted out for he 's after a lot more than just gettin out of jail And whatever it is you 're part of it
I 'll tell you what happens if you lose you tell the truth for once
Why Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably ca n't get it up anyway
I got two problems Number one I 'm not playin games Number two you got nothin to bet with
You need five years training to handle a joint like
Bullshit Attitude and experience get you through
If they kick my ass they 'll sure as hell carve yours up
This part of town they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in Just back me up like you 've got a piece
Well
Sure Then we had a fight this morning
Last night
I do n't give out the details
Now where we goin convict
You really do have onoe huh Jack what 's her problem besides you
Who 'd you call on the phone back at the booking station
Yeah I 'm hungry too I know of a place Let 's go eat
We eat when I say we eat
Yeah well my ass bleeds for you And I did n't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn trim hunt stop moaning
We 're on the move Let 's go As they walk toward a corridor
He 's got ta take that call if there is one
What do you think
Thank you
Just throw me the Goddamn gun
I 'm tellin you to drop the Goddam gun
I 'm helpin you huh
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me
I may call you worse than that
I do n't give a damn It happens to be my name
I can read a police file shithead and quit calling me Jack
Luther was part of the gang
Okay let 's get down to it I did my part and got you out So now you tell me where we 're goin
Yeah
Get this We ai n't partners We ai n't brothers We ai n't friends I 'm puttin you down and keepin you down until Ganz is locked up or dead And if Ganz gets away you 're gon na be sorry we ever met
You just do n't get it do your Reggie There is n't any deal I own your ass
You got a girl shit the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
Listen it may be a little out of date You know I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies
What are you talkin about This suit 's mine It cost 900
I 'll think about it
Bullshit
What 's the big deal about you bein on the street
You 're crazy
Yeah
Ganz is in jail He 's gon na be there two years after I 'm on the street
Not likely Reggie Maybe I just need some help
Sure anything you want
You got a name cop
Where the Christ do you think you 're going
He 's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I 've worked with
I did n't have the time
Right I screwed up I fucked up I messed up Anybody could have done better especially you I bet you 're real good at hitting targets through crowds
You could n't get to him
Which one pulled the trigger
How did they get away
What the bell happened
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces We got enough dead cops on this one
Jack
Okay You 're not a team player You got ta do things your own way Fine Nail this guy and make us all look good But you better watch your ass If you screw up I can promise you you 're goin down
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one Jack
Anthing botherin you besides losin your gun
Jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian In other words we ca n't seen like we 're in the revenge business I know we all know the truth 's a little different
Yeah I read the report
COP I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible
COP Somebody steals your gun you 're supposed to file a report
COP But that 's what you say about all of us all the tine we 're always the ones fucking up when you tell it
COP That 's what you say Cates
Jesus Christ Why the hell did n't you tell me before
I almost forgot That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him
I got to wait for a call
Bullshit red tape
Nothing came in for me yet No calls
Aw bullshit you heard wrong
So do you been a long day
One of em 's in the slam
I think I wan na have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking Can we find them
Tell me that 's not the same guy
Wait a minute wait a minute who 's this
Who are all these
Billy Bear
This guy must have had a 44 like yours Jack Now he 's got yours
Every last bit of it The big guy 's room was empty
I dunno he 's gon na call me
He he wants me to help him skip town
I think I met her Now tell us something we do n't know like where they stashed her
Who gives a fuck what you think
Have n't seen him for years That 's the truth
A cop
You 're impossible
Tell me
Where is he
Yeah bein a hard-ass all the time is a real drag but it works
Usual bullshit You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend You know somethin shootin guys sucks Especially compared to this
Let 's go Reggie
Whaddya think
Hey Come on shrink time 's over They would n't go see some old girlfriend
So what
Come on they were a little old for a slumber party
Jack it 's all over the papers He 's an obvious type But this Indian
Ganz is going to be hard to track Just a pure schizo wires all crossed totally without any pattern kill anybody The Indian himself anybody
I 've been better Dead end No Ganz no Indian
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours
Do n't We 've had a hard night
Hiya kid
Fuck you
Hello
Jack wait
Jack What was that
So am I
No wonder you 're so popular
I 'm at work asshole Where else
Listen Goddamn it if you think I 'm happy about it you 're nuts I just got ta take care of a few things okay
Just one Some lady called Said she 's a little hot-headed sometimes But she still wants her occasional roommate She 'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight if it 's humanly possible
That 's right I 'm not like you I 'm not gon na sit on my ass wondering what 's right and what 's wrong There 's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I 'm gon na get him Because it 's my job And if you do n't get that
I did n't get burned two cops did Listen I 'll tell you about personnel responsibility I like to get the job done right And if I do n't get my job done right I 'm for shit
Bullshit I 'll tell you about bullshit My gun 's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it It is n't my macho bullshit that 's killing people my gun is
Sure okay fine no problem See there 's this kid in jail First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows
Yeah Guess it must have been a slow news day
Yeah one of my favorites
Guess people ought to know who I am
Thanks for the coffee
You sure you want me to
That 's the way I see it too
I wish you 'd stop trying to make me mad so I wo n't care for you I wish you 'd give me a little more of a chance
When you start with that attitude it 's like I do n't know who you are
Maybe that makes a nice excuse
That 's a fairly crummy way to start a morning
Maybe you ought to buy me one
You know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning
Tell me I 'm dyin to hear it
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems I 'll take brutal indifference
Are n't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit
Then I sit back and I think I mean who 's to say I 'm not a dumb bitch I work in a bar right I ca n't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place You are what you do
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I 'd just poured him Then I tried to deck the sucker
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today
I 'm all wet
You 're hopeless
I still do n't think it 's loaded
I do n't think your gun 's loaded
What am I wanted for
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend He was loyal went all the way for you
Hey two days with him is enough
Hard man to live with

At your service
Appipulai Leeloo Minai
You are a monster Zorg
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
They are robots
Follow me Life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction Look at this empty glass
would you like a drink
I 'm a priest I 'm here to serve life All you want to do is destroy it
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you
Why on earth do the stones interest you
I remember you now..the so called art dealer
I 'm fucked
That 's what I 'm saying
Yes of course but The Stones are shut They have to be open for it to work
Theoretically yes The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there but I do n't have the reference book I 've never seen the Stones work
Uh Have you tried the Diva 's suite
Leeloo 's in trouble
You 're probably very angry with me and I quite understand But I want you to know I 'm fighting for a noble cause
What are you doing
Of course
We have to save the world
We 're not going on vacation..we 're on a mission
I 'm sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston
It means Never without my permission
I know I was there when she arrived
I might call to check up on her you know to see if she 's better
Dallas Korben Dallas
She 's an exception
Uh yes we 're cousins..distant cousins
There 's not a moment to lose Wake her up but be gentle about it This woman is mankind 's most precious possession She is perfect
He 's a she
I brought the girl remember
She dropped in on me holding this
She 's not my bride she 's my fare She 's looking for this Vito Cornelius According to the phone guide he lives here
Excuse me I 'm looking for a priest
What are we going to do
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop You ca n't even tell me what it is I ask you for options you give me bullshit Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards
But what happens if instead of this Ultimate Warrior it is EVIL who stands here
Is there anything that can stop it
And then
That 's exactly what we are going to try and do Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens General You may fire when ready
Your theory is interesting Father but I do n't think we have time to go into it right now
Imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are Because it is evil TOTAL EVIL
You 're all safe Thanks be to God
On the plane with Mr Dallas the real one
Good work my son Now all we need is a way to get there
Perfect
I did n't know your size
Yes Of course
Learning our history The last 5000 years that she missed She 's been out of circulation a while you know
Absolutely sure There 's the triple suns on her gloves
The Supreme Being the fifth element is here in our parish It 's a miracle
I ca n't wear these clothes This calls for dignity I have to dress the part
It 's a miracle
I 'm sorry but the Stones
Listen the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her I never saw her again
I I do n't know We hardly know each other it takes time
I 'll help her I promise but I think you should tell me where the Stones are
So Cornelius was telling the truth
Leeloo is she 's

Do n't you open your messages
And the third one
Three reasons One As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission
You 're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible Any questions
To save the world
Major Dallas if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance
Tell me
Why Why would you need me
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine There is no need for me other than this I 'm immortal but I have no life
Exactly
You 're right but there are lots of good things beautiful things
Leeloo Listen to me I 'll take you on a vacation afterwards A real vacation this time for as long as you want Come on You can do it
You can sleep tomorrow come on
It 's up to you now Angel
I know all that Leeloo I 'm talking about the Stones
Leeloo The Stones We have to open them How does it work
I told you not to read all that crap
Why We did pretty well would n't you say
The words you 're looking for were n't in the dictionary you studied I wo n't be long
It 's difficult
I told you I need to work in peace Remember I need to concentrate
I 'm going to see the Diva sing What 's the matter Do I look bad
OK you can turn around
Yes you know there 's a lot of differences between men women
You know women normally change five times more than men

Been here long
It 's an honor to receive you Mr President
An elephant could n't crack it
Wonderful
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector The cell is for lack of a better word perfect
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours there are simply more of them tightly packed His knowledge is probably limitless
Sounds like a freak of nature to me
Talk English Doc
Have you identified it
This is all that survived
They just landed in the desert
I want your best man on this
The-Stones were n't aboard the ship
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan They deplore the incident but accept our apologies
Staedert What 's going on Did you destroy it
My philosophy Mr President is shoot first ask questions later I do n't like uninvited guests
Wait or act
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet all the calibers are overshot..we 're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging

DEALER Mixed hard bondage Rape films Sick shit Buy five get one free
I promised him to Machine
Nobody knows anything
There 's nothing there you brain dead cunt Think about it There 's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything I want you to hang the phone up and if you call me about this again I 'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader
Blow me you paranoid fuck that 's impossible Why are you bothering me with this
Bullshit
What are you talking about
What do you want
I 'll get it It 's in a safe deposit box in the city
He does n't know anything he 's got nothing to do with this
Look he 's got nothing to do with this let him go

VELVET Shut up cunt Do exactly as I say or I 'll put this arrow through your throat
VELVET Empty the gun onto the table very carefully

VELVET Brooklyn Do n't be late
VELVET He 's in It will be his pleasure
VELVET I 'll do this for you Fifteen thousand dollars
VELVET You trust me to keep your money but not to take your picture
VELVET What 's the problem
VELVET You have a beautiful face the way the light hits it I 'd like to take your picture You do n't mind
We can do that
If it 's not him there 's no deal
And the other performer it has to be that monster you use the man in the mask
I want to watch you work

VELVET Leave him alone
Move it dirtbag
VELVET Put the gun down take the handcuffs Handcuff yourself to the bed
It 's good what you 're doing
It 's horrible but it 'll be your best friend after a few days I hope you realize what kind of long shot you 're chasing after
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance We try to keep the children and adults separate No eating or smoking in here but there 's a coffee machine in the hall
They were pretty clear they did n't want this coming back on them
They 're putting themselves in place of this kid 's parents and thinking they 'd want to hear their girl 's okay even if that 's all they hear
This doctor and wife they 're nice people but they do n't want to get too involved They 're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either You and I both know sometimes not often but sometimes there 's real reasons why a kid 'll run Molestation whatever Besides that the girl 's probably eighteen so she 's legal
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive
I figured you share information
Few days ago I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia a doctor and his wife What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into Philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city Nice kid mature did n't have much to say but they got a sense she 's a runaway so all through dinner the doctor 's working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone Not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself That 's the last they saw her The reason they came to me for help the reason I 'm coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch They want to see if I can I.D this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid 's alive doing alright
There are reasons for the way we do things here
Alright Tom
What can I do for you Mr Welles
That 's right you just stood there and watched because you felt like it Almost makes you worse
Easy enough for you
Do n't think I wo n't
I fucking do n't know What do you think we were n't burying treasure We did n't pace it out so we could come back and get it We dug a hole and we put her in it Your guess is as good as mine
I do n't know out there somewhere
You got absolute zero
You ca n't go to the cops All you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing
Keep moving
Took it out the bathroom window Buried it in the woods
There was n't nobody around This place was a shit-hole I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries Dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and Machine went to work
What do you want to know You saw it you saw the loop
Made me sick but what did I care What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that It was just something I was doing for money
I do n't know I felt like it I never saw anyone get done before
Why
Fuck you then you want to know I talked her up told her how beautiful she was told her she was gon na be a star I told her I was gon na get her a screen test and while I 'm doing that I got her a soda and dropped a mickey When it was dark enough I rang Dino and told him it was go time I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it That 's what happened She 's dead She 's been dead a long fucking time Nobody fucking cares
What the fuck do you want from me
Something like that
It was a lot of fucking money
Thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker
Yeah
Yeah the fucking lawyer
What the fuck am I gon na protect that freak for He was Dino 's boy not mine He shows up with his mask on leaves with his mask on Nobody knows
I told you I do n't know
I do n't know
What do you want
Fuck you
How 'd you find me here
I 'm gon na kill you
What 's he talking about
What the fuck are you
Who is this
What
Yeah who 's this
Celebrity Films
VOICE Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head Till then fuck you
VOICE The only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap you 're peddling Eddie Where do you get this stuff
VOICE I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it
Look at him You think he played it square How much did he give you how much did he keep for himself
Go ahead shoot me Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield
You 'll get it when we get there
Fuck you
Because he could He did it because he could What other reason were you looking for
Is n't it incredibly obvious
A man like Mr Christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain
You 're asking me why
You 're making me very angry
Shut your mouth and drive
Shut up
Mary Anne Mathews that was her name Her mom remembers her
Except you 're willing commit murder with them
Followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies
That 's why you got scared when Mrs Christian hired me You knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe How 'd you find me
Must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything Would 've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money
So he sent you gave you the money his errand-boy And if you refused it was n't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film That 's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege
You were the middleman am I right Old man Christian was n't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
That 's right
Of what sort
I 'm listening
It 's not my money The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought Let 's not make a big deal out of this okay Go be a race car driver Go run for President Whatever
It 's money People use it to purchase goods and services
Nope
I 'm trying to figure that out myself I have to see Machine without his mask
Devil frightened me as much as it excited me but I 'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite
What kind of Junior P.I would I be if I did n't go with you
Nobody knows his name That 's his thing He always wears a mask You never see his face He calls himself Machine that 's what they call him Machine
I told you he 's one of Dino Velvet 's stock players
Who is this in the mask Who is he
It 's cheap and people know to mind their own business What have you got for me
Great
You did n't say it was gon na be this luxurious
Consider it Meanwhile dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can Get receipts I 'll call back
Take a vacation I 'll pay you four hundred a day plus expenses
Well I 'm in New York now What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand
Alright I get the picture
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look He 'll also do commissions for enough money
You 're learning
His stuff comes out of New York Bondage and fetish videos Gothic Hardcore Definitely not for the squeamish
Dino Velvet yeah he 's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks supposed to be a real weirdo
So you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this
I see a ring on your finger You have any kids
You ca n't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb So what Am I gon na go off and be a race car driver Go to Harvard Run for President What about you pops
Yeah I 'm a real genius What choices have I got Fuck just because I know about stuff like tonight does n't mean I deal it I work a job It beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers
I 'm not mixed up in anything hayseed What are you talking about
I do n't know where are yours
Twenty-five
First of all basement sales like tonight are n't gon na last much longer It 's too risky one and two everything 's going on the internet Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants It 's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks They 're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em But there 's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes No one knows where it comes from That 's local underground where information spreads by word of mouth Those are zombies hardcore junkies Their hands are permanently pruned They go out in the sun they do n't burn they blister Other than that all I know about is the mail Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes Secret couriers Credit card orders to dummy corporations Interstate wire transfers Revolving P.O boxes But if you 're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows That 's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops ca n't trace the deal There 's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is
I heard you asking That guy was n't yanking you around There 's no such thing
There 's two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal Foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she males hemaphrodites it 's beyond hardcore but legal This is the kind of hardcore where one guy 's going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love Now with some of the S+M and bondage films they straddle the line How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not Step over that line you 're into kiddie porn Rape films but there are n't many I 've never seen one
What you saw tonight we 're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend We 're talking about stuff where people get hurt Specialty product
You 've got Penthouse Playboy Hustler etc Nobody even considers them pornography anymore Then there 's mainstream hardcore Triple X The difference is penetration That 's hardcore That whole industry 's up in the valley Writers directors porn stars They 're celebrities or they think they are They pump out 150 videos a week A week They 've even got a porno Academy Awards America loves pornography Anybody tells you they never use pornography they 're lying Somebody 's buying those videos Somebody 's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex Know what else It 's only gon na get worse More and more you 'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream because that 's evolution Desensitization Oh my God Elvis Presley 's wiggling his hips how offensive Nowadays Mtv 's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out Know what I mean For the porn-addict big tits are n't big enough after a while They have to be the biggest tits ever Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head literally Soon Playboy is gon na be Penthouse Penthouse 'll be Hustler Hustler 'll be hardcore and hardcore films 'll be medical films People 'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds There 's nowhere else for it to go
Hello
Tomorrow night I get off at eight
Sounds good pops
Four hundred a week off the books

There 's not much illegal
Max
Three four years
Good for you
Thomas Welles Nice picture
Came back for that battery-operated vagina right Told you you would
Might get drummed out of the pornographer 's union and then where would I be
I tear off the cover and paste this one on You know how it is
Catchy title What are you really reading Hard to believe that book 's got any parts worth highlighting
I 'll risk it
Well it 's tempting but no thanks
Pardon me
Yeah guess so
If you have a pencil and paper I 'll tell you how to send it
I 've got about five thousand left in cash but I 'll need another thirty if you approve
I 've made progress I 'm in Manhattan Once a few more pieces fall into place I 'll drive to you and give you an update
I hope it 's nothing serious
I do n't know if luck 's the word Are you feeling alright
Mrs Christian Tom Welles here
You 're one hell of a detective Mrs Christian
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged No return address You dug this up all by yourself
For a human life murder on film no statute of limitations Who knows It sure could have I 'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
I 'm here
CHRISTIAN To the penny Exactly one million dollars in cash
CHRISTIAN Totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
CHRISTIAN One was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents Another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
I 'm not positive this means anything
Okay
Nothing remotely like this
I deal in divorce cases Corporate investigations
It wo n't work like that
You do n't have any other choice
You you need to go to the police
CHRISTIAN Will you watch it and see for yourself
CHRISTIAN I 'm telling you it 's not that
CHRISTIAN No
Mrs Christian please will you sit down a moment I want you to listen carefully What you 're talking about is a snuff film But from what I know snuff films are a kind of urban myth Like red light district folklore There 's no such thing I can assure you
CHRISTIAN This is a movie showing a girl being murdered She 's sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife I only watched what I could
CHRISTIAN It 's a film of a girl being murdered
Do you want to tell me what you found
You hired someone to open it I 'll bet the lawyer loved that
CHRISTIAN Just curious
CHRISTIAN Do you carry a gun Mr Welles
He succeeded
Pittsburgh
CHRISTIAN His passing has left me with something of a dilemma A terrible terrible dilemma
CHRISTIAN As you know my husband passed away recently Two weeks ago now
I 've been privileged to provide services for people I admire
CHRISTIAN He 's a lawyer Please sit here
Thank you
CHRISTIAN Apparently Mr Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak
I try to be
They murdered her Mrs Mathews I 'm sorry It happened a month after she ran away She 's been dead all this time
They killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her
He raped her and and and he murdered her he cut her up with knifes
They brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
Someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her
Mrs Mathews your daughter is dead She 's dead
She went to California to Los Angeles she wanted to start over She wanted to be an actress
I have to tell you something It wo n't be easy for you to hear It 's about your daughter Mary Anne When I when I was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware If you read it you 'll know what I 'm telling you is true
Mrs Mathews It 's Thomas Do you remember I was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
MATHEWS What am I supposed to do Forget her Time heals all wounds right She 's all I think about and I 've learned to live with that But you want the truth the real truth If I had a choice if I had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing I 'd choose to know
MATHEWS I think about it everyday But every time the phone rings every single time I still think it 's her
You were right I did n't find anything I 'm going to run and get something to eat Are you hungry
MATHEWS My husband never laid a hand on her She would have told me she would have told me
MATHEWS How how can you say that to me
MATHEWS No You do n't have any reason to think that
MATHEWS I do n't know I think so
MATHEWS There was n't one The police looked
MATHEWS What
MATHEWS You should be
MATHEWS Are you religious
MATHEWS Does n't make much sense does it When everything 's happy when life 's fine and you have every reason to believe there 's a God you do n't bother Then something horrible happens that 's when you start praying all the time That 's when you start going to church
I I should n't take anymore of your time Maybe we can finish tomorrow I 'll call tomorrow
MATHEWS People remember me from the news Can you drive me back now
I had to ask I apologize
I did n't mean to
You have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter Were there any indications of any sort of abuse
Why do you think he did it
September 4th 1993 About a year after Mary disappeared
If there 's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but I have to ask Your husband he committed suicide
What was she running from
She just seemed depressed
So she did n't leave a note She never gave any indication where she might go before she left
MATHEWS I did n't think there were private detectives anymore except on TV
MATHEWS They hired you You 're like a private detective
Well I 'm following up on your daughter Mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair Born April 24 1976 Missing June 11th 1992 A runaway that 's how she 's listed Is this information correct
Right Agent Cole told me he 'd call and let you know to expect me He did n't call
What was the name I 've got it here somewhere
MATHEWS Yes but
MATHEWS I do n't understand who are
Hello Mrs Mathews my name 's Thomas Jones I 'm a state licensed investigator

The mirror You ca n't see yourself in it
Do n't you think it kind of defeats the purpose
Kristen what happened

How 'd you learn so much about dreams
Great you would n't happen to know his phone number
Sounds like a game show host to me
You could do worse
Yeah I 'm not so sure
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid God I ca n't find them I ca n't find them anywhere
Saw who I was up all night cramming for this physics test and I was putting this little baby together Look

I got ta get to the library before it closes Killer physics test
Save it for later Come on
Debbie She 's gone I 've collected her like the others
Something 's wrong here It feels like
You know I get the weirdest feeling we 've been through this before
It 's okay we 're just about there
Cut that shit out Maybe before but not now I want to help you I 'm on your side
Hey you 're not alone We have to stop him I 'm with you
Who
Then what else can we do
Why ca n't we just talk to the authorities
I do n't think so I guess this is my own war
Not really
Alright let 's assume this whole thing is true Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you
How long have you been awake
No offense or anything but it 's kind of hard to swallow
Extra money huh
Kristen 's story really got to her
In her dream
It was no suicide It was not an accident It was Freddy and he 's coming back for seconds thirds and fourths
I know Uh Alice
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen She was n't feeling very well
No
Enough of that crap
Asthma attack what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack She was gon na be a doctor
I think Sheila 's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them
Rick please
About Freddy
How she doing I ran into her last night
She knew she was gon na die
Now it gets weird She says he comes back in dreams If he kills you there you 're dead for real
It pissed off a lot of parents According to Kristen they hunted him down roasted him alive
She told us the story of Freddy It 's a town legend He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality
Let me talk to you
Excuse me ladies I 'll just be a moment
Earth to Alice
Mother you 've just murdered me Take that to your goddamn therapy
Sorry Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who 's now after me In case you have n't been keeping score it 's his fucking banquet and I 'm the LAST COURSE
Your distraught It 'll help
You 're just tired Do n't think I have n't noticed your not sleeping That has to stop honey
Something the matter with the cuisine
It 's okay babe We 're with you
I 'll tell you later
I though Freddy was just an old town story
Oh God He killed them
When dad 's popping aspiring like popcorn it 's avoid-all-contact-day
Avoid-all-contact-day
Do n't worry honey
You just stay put You need rest
You had a nasty bump
Feeling better now
JORDAN We know you 've been through a lot but there 's more than your feelings at stake here
JORDAN In your present condition Alice we 're worried about your ability
Look I appreciate what you 're offering but no He is my responsibility
JORDAN Frankly dear we wondered what you intend to do with our baby
JORDAN Excuse us dear
But how
What do you mean
Where is he
Mommy
Who says I do n't like you
No you 're not You do n't even care about being a mom How come you do n't think about me
She does n't want me around
No
Been having bad dreams
I could tell you were sad I just wanted to see if you were all right
I 'm sorry your boyfriend got killed
It 's lonely in there in my room
Huh
Me too
You 're right
Yeah I guess
No Well not exactly it 's that I felt like I was n't in control For the first time since all that I 'm scared
He 'll show up C'mon what 's really wrong
Okay babe What 's the matter
They 're coach seats but the plane lands in Paris It 's gon na be a helluva summer hon
Sorry babe
Hi beautiful
But Dad
I 've got to go
'S DAD No I 'm not I sort of hope it 's a boy Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again
'S DAD Since my little girl became a mom
'S DAD Alice
'S DAD Sobering
Daddy he 's coming back Krueger 's coming back Make them understand
It 's just across the park
Thanks for everything Dad
'S DAD Where are we going
Dad
That 's in the past Unless you 've stopped going to the meetings
I was afraid you were n't coming
He sure loves to stay awake
You do good work Alice
But how are we gon na
What
You think that 's the place she 's buried
Are you alright
Look we 're all tired None of us had any sleep since Friday night
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman Why do n't you take off leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while
And so is your baby You 've got more than just yourself to think of now
I am your friend and I 'm worried sick about you But you 're like a locked safe You 've got ta start dealing with reality
I really think you need to calm down now okay
Oh Alice no Honey I love you but you 're going to have to get a hold of yourself
You had me scared on the phone What 's wrong with the baby
I do n't understand what 's happening Krueger has to use my dreams but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake How 's he doing it
It was just an accident Like with Dan
What 's that got to do with it
Did everyone call everyone
There are n't any little boys on your floor
Alice it 's no dream I 'm sorry Dan 's dead
Yeah before they revoke his diploma
No the Dan part was nice
Had kind of a long night
She killed herself Her soul 's gon na be in torment
No shit
Empty plot Memorial stone Vacant They never did put her under Cool huh
They could n't prove it No body Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business
That 's what the newspapers thought She spent the rest of her life in the asylum After Krueger 's trial she flipped out and hung herself so they thought
That 's their problem
Then we 'll find another way
I 'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr Fred Krueger
I do n't know
What you named it already
Who 's Jacob
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy
Maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that Polly Perfect shit
Do you think I 'm an idiot for being in love with her
Then get out
I thought about that
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta And
Mark are you okay
I 've got to write some of this down
My dad 's got this thing about drinking in the house
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis
Give up Mark it 's hopeless
Oh man I could 've gone all night without looking at that
Who
You know my mother get real What about Alice 's
Pimples heartburn cellulite and no modeling career
My undying love Have some
Yeah when are you gon na come to your senses
Bottom line Alice Anybody supernatural or not that wants to hurt you he 'll have to go through us first
Look Dan 's parents were pushing him Pushing him hard He was bitching about it at the party last night He was under pressure We all are
Stop saying that it 's bullshit
Naah I 'm done Got to be on shift in a couple hours Are n't you going in
That means they 're gon na give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I 'm done
All right kids I tell you what we 're gon na do I 've got swimming practice until six-thirty today
These things are wild What do you think
You too
It 's okay
I 'm not finished I loved Greta A lot And if maybe just maybe someone or some thing killed her I 'd like to hear about it
Why do n't you shut up and let her talk Two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal
Vomit
Dan And he 's taking Alice with him pretty good dive Yvonne You 've been practicing
I would n't worry So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark and people like you the Skipper Dave Kent Sir Ian and my father
But if they u do u
Which is the one we have to worry about
They 're so remote cold beautiful the stars But now I wonder
However our ideas disagree as I 've said before I 'm u not u a coward And it happens you 've got no choice Either u I u take you down there in the Lungfish or you do n't get there
That 's enough Holloway I 've told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine does n't auto matically endow you with back bone
Unidentified Flying Objects
Peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit Show me a man who says you win u those u by fighting wars and u I 'll u show you an idiot
Perhaps But the idea of willingly going to u school u to spend my u life u at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards I 'm referring to War u that u strikes me as the u worst u cowardice of all being spiritually yellow
That may be But Dad stays where u he u is and I 'm staying here
Wearing a uniform does n't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage u Commander u It just so happens I 'm u not u a coward physical or mental and before I 'd risk my father 's life
You 'trade school boys are all alike are n't you Anybody who does n't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward
What did you mean I 'm 'out
My father He 's not
What is it
You could train someone else
It was moderate He 'll be all right But it was out of the question his coming along
It was supposed to be Dad had a heart attack two days ago
What 's goin on in here Lad What
Oh it does
I 'm with u you u
We 'll have to look for them later
Somewhere down there
The sound again
Let 's get back to work and maybe we u will u be soon
You know it u is u
Strange you did n't hear it OMIT 274F
Listen Hear that
Go back and tell Dr Neilsen Have him report to the Skipper
What 's more important there 's our problem The bow ram the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break If we can cut the ram the Shark can pull herself loose
Not u alone u you 're not
Reef and I can take the Explorer down clamp it around the eye and
You 've got to let us try Skipper
We 're stuck tight
Cyclops
Have you ever talked to Carl tried to see his side
A lot of people think like that
So
I guess
I might have a son like u that u
You 've asked why I stay a bachelor There goes the best reason I know
What could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
At the worst possible moment Tomorrow is Janie 's birthday Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home Now
Reef
But Julie 's a nice girl and I 've seen you work She deserves a fighting chance
We hope
With their underwater experience they 'll be invaluable Take sidearms and flare pistols
You better take Powell and Carney with you
What course Skipper
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo
Course and speed
What about down
Is there any way out of it
Get ready We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard
We 're dead in the water But it indicates we 're moving
The inertial navigation system Must have been knocked out in the crash
Skipper could you take a look here
Yes Griff
What about time
Anything
Radiation level constantly rising
That 's wonderful Carl Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose
We read you Go ahead Doctor They 're inside the saucer It 's filled with breathable air
IAN All ready
There 's got to be an explanation
IAN What direction does the system indicate
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the Earth itself
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear But suppose it is n't at all what if it 's u magnetic u
Suppose our theorizing is correct Then this u could u be the next danger point
High-intensity arcs will burn submerged And millions of volts discharged in random directions
It does n't seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center
What 's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole
Straight to the Pole at almost fifty knots
What
And we 're at safe maximum depth already Stop engines
A hundred and eighty fathoms We ca n't be sinking that fast
But what can we accomplish
Right u at u him
What 's the running time
You 're sure it 's Cyclops
Determine extent of damage immediately
What do you think
Huh
Dr Neilsen He 'll be
I 'm afraid I have some bad news for you Reef You 'll have to share quarters this trip
I did go Just back Reef these are a couple of our passengers Sir Ian Hunt and Dr Clifford Kent My exec Commander Richard Holloway
u That u might be a u little u u rough u
To navigate wo n't you have to see your way
That 's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
VOICE I have selected you to return with me along with several other specimens for study We will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers
VOICE On the contrary I want you unharmed perfect
VOICE I am afraid not Therefore
VOICE Your friend was to remain where he was
for horrors like yourself
Tell me something Why can u I u hear you when the others could n't
That 's a u face u
VOICE Remove your weapons Commander And come here alone
IAN Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks
Due north At five knots no six
IAN We 've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times
You plotted the course of Cyclops Then that 's u our u course Wherever u he u goes u we u go until we get him
IAN Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary and the legend of Homer 'Cyclopes were the Sons of Heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by Zeus
Well I 'll be
See what
My yeoman will show you to your quarters
He musta found out They had to get rid of him And Jack 'll get blamed
Twombley involved
What is the Northcountry Development Association
As a mater of fact yes LaRiviere
I know he 's due for the last two years I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in
You do n't believe me
if Jack told the truth he could be free by the time he 's my age
Who
Who
Always has been
Well you look sad Upset I do n't mean to pry I 'm sorry about your mother It was a nice funeral
Are you alright Wade
Been putting my files into it You take sugar and milk
He 's a Selectman The town He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office I 'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car They 're town property
Chub says you 're fired
LaRiviere says he ai n't gon na pay for the fixin of your car A couple hundred for the clutch I got some more bad news Wan na hear it
the bad news is there 's a problem with Gordon 's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night Figured you 'd know something about that Wade
The good news is we have n't got to your car yet The bad news
What are you boys up to
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
Hard to say If we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on Ten or twelve thousand dollars She could win on appeal If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming they 're unduly restrictive it would n't be more than twenty-five hundred
Fine I 'll need a 500 retainer You can mail it
No not exactly I 'll look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn Interview your daughter Jill right
Good It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife Sexual problems upsetting to the child
How soon
It would help if you were married if there was someone at home while you work
That was me
You ca n't buy Wade off
Shit What are we gon na do
No of course not Just say it that 's all
You 'll get your money Do n't talk to any newspapers about this Twombley 's a big deal down in Massachusetts you know Tell them your lawyer says you should n't comment
Might as well take the rest of the day off You look sort of fucked up You 've been paid for the day anyhow right
Nope Heard it We was n't far apart I spotted this buck then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was deader n shit Called it right in

Something bugging you

You want me to follow them to Littleton
Like hell
I wish you had I 'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something That 's what usually happens
You mean Twombley
Twombley 's shot I heard that Not Jack He 's okay I assume
Twombley Jesus We got to get moving I got to get up there How would I know C'mon you drive We 'll take my truck
Huh
What 's the hurry
Fuck you
I 'm not saying that
What am I a security guard You hired me you and your Selectman friends
At the school crossing In his BMW Coulda hurt some kids I 'm gon na bust his ass
His son-in-law damn near killed me
Where 's the plow
Watch this snow It 's coming down tonight
Got here just in time Go ahead Jump in line Maybe you 'll win a prize
You know what I 'm talking about For what you 're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much Love You wo n't get away with it
You make me sick I ca n't believe you 've sunk so low
Hi honey
Yeah lots
Let the past be I 'm sorry about your mother I liked her You never know how much women like that suffer It 's like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then they 're gone
We 've done all our talking Wade
No not anymore It 's too it 's too far
I 'm not making it any worse You are Me and Jill could 've worked this thing out It 's normal it 's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it Believe it or not How do you think this makes me look treating her like some tragic victim or something
I do n't want her to go Lillian
She 's grown up some has n't she
While you went off for a few beers with your friends Is that Hettie Rodgers there with whatzizname
Me and Jill we just had a little spat She felt kind of left out I guess from not knowing some of the new kids
Lillian
I still do n't understand
Good Who
Did you get his number
Are you okay Wade What was wrong Why were you holding everyone up
Do n't lie to me You 're leaving me I can see that
Going somewhere Margie
I heard you talking You got fired this morning did n't you
What on earth is happening to you Why are you acting this way
What happened
This is nuts
How
Think they 're alright
The truck 's here Looks like they 've stayed inside since the snow started
I just want to pick up my divorce papers For the lawyer It wo n't take long
Do n't you think it 's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
Good
It was to the same woman I was just a kid It 's not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought Something for you and me to talk about and think about You know
I 've been thinking about it that 's all
There 's another thing I 've been thinking about I do n't know how you feel about the idea Margie because we 've never talked about it But I 've been thinking lately I 've been thinking we should get married sometime You and me
I 'm her father supposed to be but I 'm not able to Yes Yes I am It may be the only thing in my life I 've been so clear about wanting Even if it takes a big fight
It 's nice
What way
You knew me as a kid
But not now
You would n't have done anything like that shot someone for money
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt
Jack would n't kill for it Besides who would pay him
Jack does n't need money
Wade How can you even think such a thing Why would Jack Hewitt do that shoot Twombley on purpose
Jack 's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry He used to be a sweet kid but it 's like when he found out he could n't play ball anymore he changed Now he 's like everyone else
I heard he was drunk at Toby 's last night and got in a fight with Hettie He drove off without her
Jack 's sort of sensitive I guess More than most But he 'll be okay in a few weeks
Tonight Let 's get together
The hell she is n't Lillian 's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her I 'm gon na hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing this divorce thing rearranged I 've been thinking about it a lot It 's like she owns Jill or something Nobody owns nobody especially not kids And I pay her
Yeah I mean that
I 'm going to start one of those custody suits I do n't give a fucking shit You know
Forget it
Said what
Yeah
Yeah
See you tomorrow maybe
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party give me a call okay I 'm off
How 's she doing
New hat Jill 's up I see
Can
Is She 's dead then
Coffee 's perked
It 's broke I guess There 's an electric in the bedroom
There 's a furnace
GORDON You get the hell out of my house now asshole And know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if I have n't got you fired before the day is out I can do it with one phone call and I 'm pissed enough to do it now
GORDON Doing your fucking job I know I watch television too
GORDON You 're talking about a goddamned ticket from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something
GORDON Hold on
GORDON Moving violation I just got out of bed and you 're telling me you 're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket Now Are you nuts Is that it Whitehouse You 're nuts

Well I guess that 's what he said
Wade I got a message for you Jack Hewitt he 's looking for you Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall
Jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich

You talked to Jack
That goddamned woman Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this I 'm more than pissed Margie I 'm a whole lot more than pissed I been that plenty and I know the difference This is different
Aw c'mon I was only saying there 's something wrong with Home Made Cooking that 's all The sign 's fine What it says is wrong
I 'm not finding fault It 's a good idea good for you good for the town Real modern too

I know what it means I 'm just running out of ways to use it
Wade are you alright
That 's what you think
Well I never heard that one
We 'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him
You think I would n't remember a thing like that
Of course it happened Why would I lie about it
Yeah
I care about what happened The truth I 'm a student of history remember
Not particularly
Shit around here you shoot somebody in the woods you say it was an accident you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted Jack 's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ai n't got his deer yet and do n't want his license pulled
So Mel Gordon would n't want a professional hit That 'd make the feds dig deeper He wants an accident
Yeah the guy with the BMW I told you about I did did n't I
I do n't know You tell me
Who 'd pay him that kind of money Not the mob They got their own guys Specialists
Motive You got ta have a motive
Then who shot him
Which is
Find them everywhere
I guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
I want to let the gas run out I do n't want the bastard driving drunk and he 's always drunk now After we 'll hide the keys
Well do you still plan to get married
What about Margie
No thanks I do n't drink

There was something It happened up your way
Wade
Jim for godsake
I 'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier
Mom
You 're right and I 'll tell you a secret I know exactly how you feel
Some kids were teasing you
Your father never means to be so
No it 's okay After all he is the President right
He 's in a meeting He ca n't be disturbed
We 'll talk at home You know most girls are n't as lucky as you For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime
You 're jet-lagged We 'll talk about this back
Alice
Do n't you even want to ask
You do n't want to say hi to your father
Well you are n't the President dear
You are a resilient man Mr
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality
That 's the way of the world little one Did n't they teach you that in school
Yeah Do you know what the word quot asshole quot means
Yeah I study world events Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch 's cleansings along with 15 American school kids You know hQw I studied that I went to their funerals with my dad I met their parents
You 're one of Stravanavitch 's men
You must be tired It 'll wake you up
Okay I 'm slowing us down
It 's okay honey I got you I got you You 're okay
Been better Dad You
Alice I
Daddy
How bout a hug for the old man
How was the ballet
Oooooh I 'm good
SOLDIER The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet
SOLDIER They are in our airspace We would be within our rights
SOLDIER Yes They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails
SOLDIER The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747
It 's cut
Okay it 's on We 've got some indicator lights here
Got it
CARLTON Uh Tower we got a problem up here
CARLTON Aw man You 're torn up pretty bad out here sir Do you have any elevater control
No We 're losing fuel and my rudder 's not responding
Uh we got a problem here
How we doing Colonel
Got it
CARLTON Two and three are heading toward the Boeing
CARLTON Who 's flying the fucking plane
CARLTON Put your pilot on
CARLTON Mr President it 's an honor Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here
U.S Pilots this is Air Force One
I prefered the terrorists
This does n't make sense
That kid 's name was Jim Marshall
NORTHWOOD Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you 're making demands
NORTHWOOD He 's dead then They must have killed him
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it 's just an exercise
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders is n't as popular as we thought it 'd be Representative Taylor is working on a compromise
It was a good ad-lib sir
Sir you threw out page two
CHANDLER The Chief Justice What on earth for
NORTHWOOD Iraqi 's wo n't buy it Either they 're already in on this or they 'll think we 're spying
NORTHWOOD Like any good poker player they 're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard
CHANDLER Okay Also I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike
CHANDLER But they start executing hostages in
CHANDLER Can we do that
NORTHWOOD General Greely says it looks like the Middle East
You 're duty to what The country you served does n't exist anymore
Why
Special Agent Gibbs You helped do this
That 's affirmative
PILOT Air Force One please reduce speed to 250 knots
PILOT Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet Over
PILOT Air Force One this is AF-135-RA We have been instructed to refuel your plane
Over the Black Sea I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia
Not even close Hell we ca n't even make Syria or Iraq
We 've stopped dumping but we 've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left
Avionics compartment It 's the only place You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless of course you 'd rather be a martyr than a savior
Well it worked
why did they do that
A secret service agent It must be
Who did this
Nine
Dead
Sir this plane carries the President of the United States
Copy Air Force One
Tower here
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower
Romeo Tango Zulu do you have the President Over
PILOT Tower Air Force One has been boarded
You 're pointing a gun at me
How are your fellow hostages feeling Ms Mitchell
And what is it you do Ms Mitchell
Please tell me your name
Here 's a press kit I 'll let you guys get comfortable and once we 're airborne I 'll be able to schedule the interviews
And all these rooms here
A dubious distinction no
This is a remarkable aircraft
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you Now if you 're all cleared You can follow me then
You 're very valuable And our nation needs so many things
Three
Four
The world is such a dangerous place and we ca n't always protect our children
Nor will there be My husband does not negotiate with terrorists
No
So is this Come now you 're upsetting the little one
But they are not ny people You look at me as if I am a monster but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who 's faces You will never see Did You cry for their wives and children They were people too yes but they were not your people
I neither enjoy nor dislike I do what is necessary
Yes
Your husband is a coward He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night
I know he left you behind
Or you will do what Mrs Marshall But I admire your courage Your husband on the other hand
Come on Alice
Cooperation If you try to escape you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade 's bodies will prevent you from exiting Good day
Fear will keep you alive Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish and bound to die
No you wo n't You 'll compromise like always
Let my daughter go or I 'll take you out
One thing I 've learned as
You do n't like seeing people get hurt Now in morality that is a virtue In politics however that is weakness You were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to
Good Good
You 'll do it
Pity Mr Gibbs
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch S release
No But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill perhaps I will start with your family instead Gibbs
Now since we 've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate I wondered if you would be so kind
Finally we can bargain
Madame Vice president We have an options paper chandler takes the options paper waves off Lee and reads it as she talks
Twenty minutes
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground Our hands are completely tied while they 're in the air
CALDWELL Sir we stay with the President
I 'll not going without my family
CALDWELL Eighteen thousand feet sir And two hundred knots otherwise it 's suicide
They 've cut communication and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives My only solution ran out of batteries
We 've already played our cards Major There 's no turning back
Mr Caidwell the ground 's a few miles away How do you propose getting us from here to there
CALDWELL The northern border 's gotten a bit hairy Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage
CALDWELL Our KH-ll 's took this one at 0100 hours What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades
Flying the plane
Both of you
Please do n't start with me
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in
Well they are n't burning me in effigy That 's always a good sign
This promise is n't subject to Congressional approval
I 'll make it up to you I promise
But that 's the point Jim We 're right here
What
And when have I had five minutes When I wake up in the morning and I 'm already three hours behind Schedule What do you want me to do Rose tell the G7 to fuck off because I 'm a family man
She 's a big girl She understands
Rose I do n't have time for this
No Mr President It ca n't
May I speak to you for a moment
Someone should give you a raise
Where are we sending it
No good I said they disabled the communications system
Excuse me
Freeing Stravanavitch is gon na get tens of thousands killed I ca n't live with that I 'm not royalty I 'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office We do n't negotitate Not as long as I 'm President Is that understood
CHANDLER But this is different sir You 're the President
CHANDLER and if that means negotiating
CHANDLER They 're still alive but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes
SERVICE AGENT Two THREE GO
SERVICE AGENT One
Where 's my family

Okay Hey pumpkin you 'll tell me all about it later right
Yes sir
That 's my job
We 'll just say it was in bad taste
Did we tape the Duke game
It 's bait Do n't take it
Other way around sir
We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge The second amendment types 'll love that
With all due respect sir maybe you should give them this one Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch
No no I 'm fine What did the Speaker say
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy
Commissioner Aquarius
I was asking McCrosky Commissioner
What 's the story
Forget it I was reading
I told you leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down
That just does n't make any sense
I just wish it was that simple
Commissioner
Bud get wise to the political realities The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown
Forget it The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule
Um Do you people scream right when you you know
Yes it did Mr Dunn can I ask you a personal question
Yes I did
You better take this
Dunn
Sir I 've got an overload in disposal unit four
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four sir
Shut down accelerators
Oveur
Ted the lever
Now
We 've blown the computer Elaine Set course change
Not when I 'm with you Ted
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds He 'll roast like a pig on a spit
That 's right premature ejection
Sit down Elaine If this bomb trick works we just might make it Simon was a fool to eject now
That might be the news we 've been waiting for
Well Elaine this might be it if those guys on the ground do n't think of something
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place You people knew this ship was n't ready to fly You played God with over a hundred lives Kruger and for what the prestige of your precious space program
Not now Elaine
Ted please be careful
Ted there 's no time to explain
Ted
Ted a toilet 's not going to kill anyone
I 'd use the word insane
The word is sick Ted very very very sick
I 've never used the word insane Ted
Ted get a grip on yourself You should never have left the hospital
We ca n't go back We had something very special but it 's all over
Ted I do n't know why you got on this flight I do n't know what you 're trying to prove
Ted
Ted
What are you doing Ted
Ted we 're taking off
Ted What are you
That 's the way I want it Just turn the radio on and go
No goodbyes Elaine Just go
His name 's David Stockman He 's been here twenty years that 's all he says
Elaine when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way
Who 's that Ted
Ted I loved you and I 'll always love you But I need Simon He 's stable He 's a good provider I want that at this stage of the game Ted He might have his faults but Simon does n't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man
Ted please You 're just making things difficult for yourself
You 're as bad as the rest of them Elaine It 's all here in the design specifications Look It 's all here
There 's nothing wrong with me
Ask Simon
I mean the Mercury flight It 's not safe and Kurtz you know why
It 's got to be stopped
Te
Yes last week that pile of mud was only this high
The brain is an amazingly complex organ Elaine
You can be gentle with him Elaine He 's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden
You can eat balanced meals exercise and take Geritol
So you see our task is n't made any easier by Ted 's refusal to admit that he 's sick
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon Doctor
Maybe
Your career What about the lives of those people out there Simon what happened to the man I thought I loved
We 're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down
He tried to disconnect ROK It gassed him That computer is running this ship and we 're heading right for the sun
Roger
That 's my girl
Have you got it straightened out now
Meet me onboard sweetheart I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore
Simon why has he become so so
No I 've been excited before
I 'm so excited Simon
You 're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr and Mrs Simon Kurtz
Women u and u the space program have come a long way sweetheart But after the wedding no more complicated computers for my little girl
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission
No I mean you can do it from the cockpit
You can do it from up here Captain
We have to disconnect ROK 's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system
I do n't think we have any alternative Captain
Elaine ask ROK for a field interference scan Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications
Request self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes
Request life support systems check
Request comprehensive electrical systems check
Go ahead
That 's okay ROK
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit Elaine I know where I 'm coming from on this
Negative
Negative
Look a man can make an honest mistake Anyway she was asking for it They 're all asking for it all the time
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury Dad
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us
Will Scraps be able to sit with us Dad
Yeah
Sure
Scraps
What
Okay Joey The Doc says you got ta relax This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country

He 's carrying a bomb
Which passenger is Joe Salucci
Whenever your 're ready Captain
Good to be aboard gentlemen
That 's how dry cleaning works Now I 'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians
Mr Kurtz I presume
Now he 's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury
Let 's go Daddy We have to check in He was never appreciated at the Institute
Yes
Thanks but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays
But that 's not a door The door 's over there
You ca n't go in there
All right it 's a matter of death
No dammit It 's a matter of life or death
I have to see Bud Kruger
Do n't talk to me about Elaine Outta my way
That damn computer has taken over I 'm getting out
Striker
You 're tired Striker overworked That wiring meets all the safety specifications
You 're seeing bugs where they do n't exist Striker
Are you on the Mercury mission
No It 's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father 's dying
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there 's change in the two people who share that love
Not if the people change together in relation to that love
Love 's the same as it always was It 's people who change
No I mean your relationship
Do you want to talk about it
I 'm getting over it If a relationship is n't working you ca n't force it
You do n't have to excuse yourself I 'm a nurse I understand
Yes He 's dying u a-n-d u wants to be buried on Mercury
You do n't have to thank me I 'm a nurse This is my father Dr Barrington
Excuse me are you alright I noticed you talking to yourself I 'm a nurse Can I be of some help
Just in case I do n't have a chance to say goodbye I want you to know that I have n't spent so many pleasant hours for many years
I 'm sure we 'll both make it but just in case one of us well is there a message you 'd like me to give someone
Mine 's Eleanor Eleanor Schiff
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that 's the reason The truth of the matter is nobody ever asked me
Well I 'm afraid that 's a question that 's all too easy to answer
Well after a thing like that you would n't be expected to
No I 'm from Washington D.C I 'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen 's Assocation
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles
Thank you Cream
That 's very nice of you Thank you
KRAMER Shep no He gets so excited when new people are here

KRAMER Shep sit sit So I understand you 've got a real emergency down there
Hello I 'm Paul Carey from the airline I 'm here to pick up Captain Kramer
RUMACK And the last thing he said to me Doc he said Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all they 've got and win just one for the Zipper I do n't know where I 'll be then Doc he said but I wo n't smell too good That 's for sure
RUMACK I 'm doing everything I can And stop calling me Shirley
RUMACK I wo n't deceive you Mister Striker We 're running out of time
RUMACK Will the hospital equipment be at the airport
RUMACK safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment

RUMACK I u am u serious and do n't call me Shirley What flying experience have you had
RUMACK Can you fly this airplane and land it
RUMACK I 'm not sure I have n't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival
No I mean we ca n't u land u for another two hours Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains We 've got to go through to Chicago
Well not for another two hours
I ca n't tell
RUMACK I think you ought to know what our chances are The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane but who did n't have fish for dinner
Well
No
RUMACK Extremely serious It starts with a slight fever
He had fish too
Doctor Rumack Mister Hammen ate fish And Randy says there are five more cases and they ate fish too

Ted I do n't want to stay here It 's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war
That 's Lieutennt Hurwitz Severe shell shock He thinks he 's Ethel Merman
Be patient Ted No one expects you to get over this immediately
Seven Lieutenant Zipp died this morning Ted Doctor Sandler says you 'll be out in a week Is n't that wonderful
It 's a big building where the generals meet But that 's not important right now They 've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid Is n't that good news
You got a telegram from head­quarters today
That 's the way I 've always wanted it to be Elaine
I remember everything All I have are memories
I love you
Oh Ted please be careful I worry about you so much
What 's the matter
Elaine I 've got to talk to you
It 's too late Ted When I get back to Chicago I 'm going to start my life all over again I 'm sorry
It 's the truth What 's hurt you the most is your record since the war Different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility
Your u war u u record u You 're the only one keeping that alive For everyone else it 's ancient history
Then why do n't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing
I wo n't be back I 've requested the Atlanta run
It takes so many things to make love last Most of all it takes respect And I ca n't live with a man I do n't respect
I have been patient and I 've tried to help but you would n't even let me do that
I just do n't want to go over it any more
Ted

I hope you can understand how special your world is how unique a people you humans are So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves
No shit Holmes You 're only from another goddamn planet for chrissakes
Ta ss'trakyona
Sticking out of his ass yeah See that 's what makes it a joke There 's like a surprise and your mind fills in the funny picture Here 's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it 's a thermometer Nada huh

Human children can be very beautiful Getting married Congratulations You will be taking Sunday off then
Your home is quite disordered I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in
We mate for life Divorce is a strange concept to us
You are married
My wife She worries about me
Through his ass Next time you see him tell him to call me unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes
When will Strader return
Todd Watson The assistant manager
Yeah that 's it Say it slow
And what was that one about my mother That was a good one
So what was that other word for Human Slow ka
I 'll bet Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two
Which one is that Raw what
I do n't think I could ever learn to read that shit How long did it take you to learn English
If I may make a suggestion We have different weak spots than you do Next time a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect I think you were looking for
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him
You know that guy
Matthew you do n't have to
Your mother mates out of season
Screw me That ca n't be right
I 'll handle it
Back off George
Your name would n't happen to be Porter would it
Who said that
Agree to work with me You do n't like me you do n't like any of us You have nothing but contempt for us And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner
Why did you do it
Rudyard Kipling No shit Listen we just need a minute of your time
Did you talk to him
Aw-right What about the other guy
Did you learn anything
Why the hell Great fine You talk to the wife
So the Slag they 're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery I 'd say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible Okay next step I got ta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night
How the hell do you know that
And still it fits
And that fits
A rubber A condom You know Coney Island whitefish Men human men put them on their uh penises to protect against having babies You need this for anything
Should n't we examine their personal effects
Nothing
Great Well I 'm sure glad that 's settled are n't you
Possibly Good Well would you be willing to accept the theory George that possibly by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other Does that sound unreasonable to you
Nothing 's wrong I just want to get something straight You agree that there 's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right
Well there 's a thing about partners about being somebody 's partner You do for each other And other people 's rules do n't mean shit It 's the rules set up between the two of you that 's all that counts Understand Okay Well my friend and partner was shot last night and I 'm after the shitbag that did it As my partner I 'm asking you to respect me and help me find him
Look you want to fit in here right You want to learn how to get along
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till but I do n't think that 's what they were there for I think we got us a couple a executions on our hands George
Terrific A real pillar of the community Was Hubley missing anything when they found him Was he ripped off
Through the chest Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
His body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of Central Avenue near downtown
That is exactly so It is like your name Sykes I 'm sure it does n't bother you at all that it sounds like ss'ai k'ss two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium
Gesundheit You do n't mind if I stick to George do you
Man somebody really hung one on you I 've heard some good ones for you guys Humphrey Bogart Harley Davidson I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you You were n't at the back of the line were you George
What 's that Look Jetson Get this straight in your head We 're not pals we 're not married and we ai n't gon na take long moonlight walks together We 're just partners And do n't call me Sergeant Call me Sykes or Matt if you have to
and we work my hours I 'll do the driving you do the paperwork You got ta learn it so you might as well do it all
Yeah the shells are too big for six in an cylinder Hell Matt you do n't need but one
Casull 454 Magnum You 're talking twice the impact energy of 44 Magnum hot loads
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find Well this is it
Do n't piss him off O'Neal When he gets like this I ca n't control him I 've seen this before He got like this once I saw him jerk a guy 's spine out and show it to him Nothing I could do I hadda go throw up
That where Anderson worked
Wait You know who it looks like Yeah Anderson Uh James Anderson He is n't in today He took the afternoon off
To be honest it 's hard to say I hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me
You think this is the guy who did it
Mr Hubley was an all right guy and a damn good manager The men liked him I 'm really gon na have to scramble to fill his shoes
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing
Yeah we met him Wonderful boy close personal friend of George 's here
For you anything
Here 's Hubley Left Quarantine on November thirtieth relocated first to Riverside then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year Field of expertise chemical manufacturing Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery
Yeah I heard of it
One of the two men was Hubley right What about the other one Did you know him
Ss'kya'ta
Did he find anything
What kind of test
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet
Oh here 's an extra headshot if you need one We 're just about to start cutting in You 're welcome to stick around if you want It 's really fascinating stuff
Lucky nothing I had to empty my damn gun into him
Yeah
Fedorchuk could n't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets
Yeah he was one Martin Helder White male twenty-seven Let 's see wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction a couple for sale of a controlled substance Oh yeah and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock
Yeah right Do n't push your luck Anyway according to the sheet the guy you nailed outside by the car
You know I 've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes and Hubley 's body being found over in the Newcomer community
You
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle 's death You know that Leave that for Fedorchuk
Yeah Sykes
I ca n't Do you mind
I got him Do n't get pinned
Yeah that 's comforting Mine too
You got your vest
Does that look at all suspicious to you
But you 're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing
Hey look we 've known Kristin since since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear Remember You and Edie banged the wall so hard me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week

I 'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers About equal to ten megatons
That 's it See it Emergency venting
Could it be intelligent
You 're saying one of those things lays all the eggs
But these things come from eggs so where are all the eggs coming from
Which would mean lots of those parasites right One for each person over a hundred at least
I 've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis It seems to be metabolizing He should wake up soon
I expected more of you Ripley I thought you would be smarter than this
You sent them out there and you did n't even warn them Burke Why did n't you warn them
Now wait a second
You 've been doing your homework Look they ca n't impound it if they do n't know about it
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division Now if you 're smart we can both come out of this heroes Set up for life
Corporal Hicks
Do n't make me pull rank Ripley
Bullshit
They can bill me I got a tab running What 's second
Why not
No good How do we know it 'll effect their biochemistry I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit It 's the only way to be sure
That 's not what I mean Gorman if your men have to use their weapons in there they 'll rupture the cooling system
They 're right under the primary heat exchangers
That the atmosphere processor
I hope you 're right I really do
You never said anything about an android being here Why not
Burke just tell me one thing That you 're going out there to kill them Not study Not bring back Just burn them out clean forever
No The answer is no Now please go I 'm sorry Just go would you
Spare me Burke I 've had my psych evaluation this month

Let 's get the fuck out of here
Save it
Ellen
Hicks do n't let him leave
No No She 's alive We have to
Locked
They learned They cut the power and avoided the guns They must have found another way in something we missed
It 's game time
You know Burke I do n't know which species is worse You do n't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage
Wait a minute We 'd know about it
Look you started this Now show me everything I can handle myself

Think of what We 're fucked
How The transmitter was on the APC It 's wasted
Uh what 's next
Yeah right it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training
Oh God Jesus This ai n't happening
Hey hey Look Crowe and Dietrich are n't dead man

Christ Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere we look They do n't say why and I do n't ask I do n't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer 's always 'do n't ask

because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew within twelve hours of hatching
Look I can see where this is going But I 'm telling you those things exist Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs Thousands Do you understand I suggest you find it using the flight recorder 's data Find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise
LEUWEN The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe
Look I told you
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish A willing billing lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish A willing billing lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish

Hardly

SCHLUMBERG Michael
SCHLUMBERG Michael please I 'm sure you will find her most willing Herr Mozart She 's really very excited She 's been preparing all morning
SCHLUMBERG It 's such an honour for us to have you here Herr Mozart And for Gertrude
SCHLUMBERG I 've heard about you for ages I thought you must be an old man
Gertrude
Thank you Madame Come on now courage Play me something you know
Who was your teacher
SCHLUMBERG Wine
SCHLUMBERG Perhaps a little refreshment first A little coffee or a little chocolate
Really
It is not a question of liking Your Majesty Your own law decrees it I 'm afraid
Molested Majesty Twice in the course of the same lesson
As a matter of fact one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well
I have to tell you Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
Majesty I do n't like to talk against a fellow musician
Well Sire I made some inquiries in a routine way I was curious to know why he had so few pupils It is rather alarming
Majesty I did Believe me it was a most agonizing decision But finally I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart
Well There it is
You please me Court Composer A very clever idea
Ah-ha Favouritism But I so want Mozart
And the result satisfies
Yes
I 'm thinking about Herr Mozart What is your view
Your Highness
Cattivo again Court Composer Well tell him Mozart Name us a German virtue
Well I 'm glad to hear that
My pleasure
And here is our illustrious Court Composer Herr Salieri
A-flat Majesty
You do me too much honour Sire
Majesty
It 's just a trifle of course
You are cattivo Court Composer I want to meet this young man Chamberlain arrange a pleasant welcome for him
Sire the whole opera is finished Do you know how much work went into it
Forgive me Majesty I 'm a vulgar man But I assure you my music is not
Well six or seven minutes maybe eight
I have no idea
Ah love again
I think you are rather innocent my friend In these dangerous times I can not afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
Mozart I am a tolerant man I do not censor things lightly When I do I have good reason Figaro is a bad play It stirs up hatred between the classes In France it has caused nothing but bitterness My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people I do not wish to see the same fears starting here
Would you tell me why
It is not your place to ask questions Is it true
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it Is this true
Mozart are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre
May I introduce my father He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg He would so much like to kiss your hand It would make his whole stay so memorable for him
Majesty may I ask you to do me the greatest favour
Bravo Mozart Most charming Yes indeed Clever man
Twenty-six
Well Well we have n't quite received my father 's consent Your Majesty Not entirely Not altogether
Enchanted Madame
Which few did you have in mind Majesty
My dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening I think I 'm right in saying that are n't I Court Composer
Well I mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say How shall one say Director
Of course I do It 's very good Of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate
Oh yes Absolutely German Unquestionably
Yes indeed
I think so Sire yes
Keep it Sire if you want to It is already here in my head
In a Pasha 's Harem Majesty A Seraglio
It 's actually quite amusing Majesty It 's set the whole thing is set in a in a
Because I 've already found the most wonderful libretto
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian
Really Oh grazie Signore Sono commosso E un onore per mo eccezionale Compositore brilliante e famossissimo
Oh sir yes The honour is mine Absolutely
Oh thank you
Your Majesty
STRACK He 's here
STRACK Your Majesty Herr Mozart
Well There it is
STRACK In my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir Plain German For plain people
Very small pay I imagine I 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer Say an opera in German for our National Theatre
Ah-ha Well then we should make some effort to acquire him We could use a good German composer in Vienna surely
Father
No one calls you that
Papa
I never saw this girl in my life Is this a kind of joke
Mine
But my penalty I 've got to have a penalty
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg my son
This is just a game Papa
Why not Oh come Papa What better way could I spend it than on you My kissable missable suddenly visible Papa
Did n't I I thought I did I 'm sure I did
Is n't that marvelous We 're delighted
You do n't have secrets from me
Why not
What 's that
Composition does n't pay You know that
How many
Yes
How many pupils do you have
They say you 're in debt
That 's not what I hear
How is your financial situation
Do n't you have a maid
Oh yes Oh I mean no not exactly like this I mean today just today Stanzi I remember now She had to go yes She had to help her mother Yes she 's like that Her mother 's a very sweet woman you 'll see
I do n't know Stanzi Stanzi
Feed Well of course she feeds me She stuffs me like a goose all day long She 's the best cook in the world I mean since Mama Just wait you 'll see
Am I not welcome
I will
Are you sure it 's an opera
Opera Opera
Is he working

Why What has happened
Now calm yourself Calm What 's the matter with you
Where does he work
I think I 've found out about the money sir
Oh I would n't know that sir
Oh yes sir all day long He never leaves the house until evening He just sits there writing and writing He does n't even eat
Not that I 've seen
Oh thank you sir
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson sir
Yes thank you sir
I will sir
What have you got for me today Let me see
Ah Here she comes Fraulein Lorl good morning

What
That 's right
Yes
Well we can
Because there 's nothing to see
No
Yes
What
Put it down I said It 's nothing for you
Put it down
Leave that alone
No no I love that I 'd want it to be in German I have n't done anything in German since Seraglio
German
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week twelve foot long folds up to six inches just like a paper fan It 's a miracle
'Course you would You belong here my boy not the snobby Court You could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better That 's what people want you know fantasy You do a big production fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you 'll be absolutely free to do anything you want Of course you 'd have to put a fire in it because I 've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life Oh and a few trick animals You 'd have to use those
Is n't he marvelous He cost me a bundle that horse but he 's worth it I tell you if you 'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success I 'm not joking These people are n't fools You could do something marvelous for them
Yes well it 's all good fun
That kind of music should be punishable by death
Well
What did he say What did he say
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi
My answer is no Mozart
I 'm sorry No
Well this is hardly the way to go about it
What for
What is this Mozart What 's the matter with you

A Mass A Mass for the Dead
You know it 's all here in my head It 's just ready to be set down But when I 'm dizzy like this my eyes wo n't focus I ca n't write
But you 'd have to swear not to tell a soul I 'm not allowed
Would you Actually you could
Another But that 's too soon Tomorrow night It 's impossible Did he say a hundred
Finish what
What man
Who
Shall I answer it
What
Are you ill
I do
Oh no It is a sublime piece The grandest operone I tell you you are the greatest composer known to me
I would never miss anything that you had written You must know that
No please
You mean she 's not coming back
Where is your wife
I 'm taking you home You 're not well
No no I promise you I 'll give you a wonderful piece the best I ever can
I do n't have it yet It 's not finished I 'm sorry but I need more time
How long will you give me
I am only a messenger Do you accept You will be paid well
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one
A Mass for the dead
I have come to commission work from you
You flatter me
Yes
Did my work please you
Mozart It was good of you to come
Grazie mio caro Wolfgang
I would n't presume All the same if it would n't be imposing I would like you to see my new piece It would be a tremendous honour for me
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese my friend Do you know you did n't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
I think it 's marvelous Truly
Well I can speak for the Emperor You made too many demands on the royal ear The poor man ca n't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
I know it 's outrageous Still if the public does n't like one 's work one has to accept the fact gracefully
Thank you Oh thank you
Oh Excellency would you
It 's not fair that a man like that has power over our work
Oh no My wife took it out in time
Oh I could kill him I mean really kill him I actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry
I do n't know They say I 've got to re-write the opera but it 's perfect as it is I ca n't rewrite what 's perfect Ca n't you talk to him
It 's unbelievable The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music Pages of it
I do n't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor Mozart However I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you And he has a daughter Will that do
What exactly are you working on
Forgive me We all have patriotic feelings of some kind
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum Crema al Mascarpone
Come come Mozart I 'm interested Truly
Ah how exciting Tell me more
I 'm afraid not
Of course not
How is that possible You give concerts do n't you I hear they are quite successful
It has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
You do n't mean to tell me you are living in poverty
An implausible idea Between you and me no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth
No no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity
Herr Sommer
My dear Mozart there is no one in the world I would rather help but now it is too late
I have just come from the palace The post has been filled
Why did n't you come to me yesterday Mozart This is a most painful situation Yesterday I could have helped you Today I ca n't
I 'm flattered And congratulations to you of course
So you are How is your pretty wife
Herr Mozart what brings you here
How could I not
Dear Mozart my sincere congratulations
Yes yes er on the whole yes Majesty
Love Sire
Ah
Really
Oh yes certainly Certainly Herr Director
Taking out what you should never have put in
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty 's edicts Give me your score please
Exactly A dance
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
Mozart Herr Mozart may I have a word with you please Right away
That will do Herr Mozart
What you think Mozart is scarcely the point It is what His Majesty thinks that counts
Then why especially does it have to be in German
You mean in Turkey
I I do n't think you have Herr Director Not yet I mean it 's quite n Of course I 'll show it to you immediately
May I just do that Majesty Show you how it begins Just that
Must I Well I wo n't I tell you straight I will not
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint Ohime Morbidezza Morbidezza Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music
They hate my music It terrifies them The only sound Italians understand is banality Tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to Resurrection Ba-ba Ba-ba Ba-ba Ba-ba Anything else is morbid
Naturally the Italians Of course Always the Italians
Who is on this committee
No but I 'm the best
Then why does n't he simply appoint me to the post
Is the Emperor angry with me
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl
What is this Herr Chamberlain
Elevated What does that mean Elevated The only thing a man should elevate is oh excuse me I 'm sorry I 'm stupid But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things Old dead legends How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
Sire only opera can do this In a play if more than one person speaks at the same time it 's just noise No one can understand a word But with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and it 's not noise it 's a perfect harmony Is n't that marvelous
Baron
Why not It 's charming I mean I do n't actually show concubines exposing their their It 's not indecent It 's highly moral Majesty It 's full of proper German virtues I swear it Absolutely
Oh German German Please let it be German
SALIERI Do n't pity me Pity yourself You serve a wicked God He killed Mozart not I Took him snatched him away without pity He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory He does n't care Understand that God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses He broke Mozart in half when He 'd finished with him and threw him away Like an old worn out flute
SALIERI No Father From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me Whenever they say Mozart with love they 'll have to say Salieri with loathing And that 's my immortality at last Our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy At least it 's better than the total oblivion he 'd planned for me your merciful God
SALIERI What difference does that make
SALIERI I poisoned his life
SALIERI I did
SALIERI The only thing that worried me was the actual killing How does one do that How does one kill a man It 's one thing to dream about it It 's very different when you have to do it with your own hands
SALIERI His funeral imagine it The Cathedral all Vienna sitting there His coffin Mozart 's little coffin in the middle And suddenly in that silence music A divine music bursts out over them all a great Mass of Death Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri What sublimity What depth What passion in the music Salieri has been touched by God at last And God forced to listen Powerless powerless to stop it I at the end for once laughing at Him Do you understand Do you
SALIERI Oh yes yes yes yes yes Always the same stale answers There is no God of Mercy Father Just a God of torture
SALIERI Oh I thought you did so every day So speak now Answer me
SALIERI All I ever wanted was to sing to Him That 's His doing is n't it He gave me that longing then made me mute Why Tell me that If He did n't want me to serve Him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent Go on tell me Speak for Him
SALIERI No Was Mozart a good man
SALIERI Yes Father Yes So much for my vow of chastity What did it matter Good patient hard-working chaste what did it matter Had goodness made me a good composer I realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art And I was nothing to God
Did you try
SALIERI He was murdered Father Mozart Cruelly murdered
Should I
Is it true
All Vienna has heard that
Of course The man you accuse yourself of killing
Oh I know that That 's charming I did n't know you wrote that
I regret it is not too familiar
SALIERI I 'm surprised you do n't know It was a very popular tune in its day I wrote it How about this
SALIERI Then you must know this
SALIERI Where
SALIERI How well are you trained in music
SALIERI I do not seek forgiveness
SALIERI Are they
SALIERI Do you know who I am You never heard of me did you
SALIERI Leave me alone
SALIERI What do you want
SALIERI So
SALIERI About what
SALIERI What do you want
Yes absolutely Is there a ballet in Figaro
Ballet What ballet
What anger
Incredible
Never mind
I 've seen the manuscript
You must be mad
He 's setting that play to music
You mean that play
Mozart is writing a new opera An Italian opera
I 've just learned something that might be of interest to you Herr Director
Well the play makes a hero out of a valet He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher Do you see the implications This would be in a grander situation as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor
For the same reason Herr Chamberlain that it was banned in France
STRACK Did we
STRACK Well done Sire
OLD WOMAN Oh I 'm tender enough for you my boy I 'm tender enough for you
OLD WOMAN Of course now Right away before I get any older
OLD WOMAN Well promise then
OLD WOMAN Now you 've got to promise me faithfully you 'll remain true to me forever Then you 'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you
OLD WOMAN I 've taken pity on you my angel I heard your wish
OLD WOMAN Here I am my angel
SWIETEN How sad It 's tragic is n't it Such a talent
SWIETEN Ca n't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him I 've done my best I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts He got a fee what I could afford Ca n't you think of anyone who might do something for him
SWIETEN This is embarrassing you know You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he 's begging from practically all of them It has to stop
He did n't say sir I told him I did n't know when you would be back but he insisted on waiting
Show her in Then go to bed
Excuse me my dear
Who is she
Yes indeed Goodnight to you all now It was perfection truly
Yes And congratulations to all of you It was superb
Bene
Of course
Oh yes He 's just exhausted He became dizzy that 's all We should let him rest
Well he 's sleeping now Better not
Yes I am looking after him
Thank you
You know did he seem depressed Do you think he 'll eat the food
How did he look
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet
David
HIRSCH Tea would be nice
HIRSCH I expect you shortly
HIRSCH Shall I send a car
HIRSCH You 're certain he 's lucid You wo n't need any help
HIRSCH Right Now listen carefully I want you to bring David here I want him in my care I 'll notify the police that we 've found him It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital Do you understand
HIRSCH Could you get here without any trouble
HIRSCH Is David acting strangely
HIRSCH Have you read the papers today Have you listened to the radio or television
HIRSCH The zoo Is he rational
HIRSCH Is he all right Why did n't you call me Where was he
HIRSCH Let 's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
HIRSCH Oh I do n't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon But in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others
HIRSCH David has suffered a severe trauma I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf why should n't David And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf would n't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
No He knows no one in London besides me I should n't have left him alone
HIRSCH I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret I 'm convinced that like David they believe in this werewolf
HIRSCH They were lying There were no witnesses no escaped lunatic The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there
HIRSCH I tried to investigate the attack There are no records The case was closed and now they 've 'misplaced the file David 's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he 's no good to us So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things
HIRSCH Warn him
HIRSCH What did he say
HIRSCH Has his friend appeared to him again
HIRSCH Alex has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies
At my flat I 'm off at midnight and
Yes sir
HIRSCH Come to my office Miss Price
Yes I believe he did
No sir Of course sir Good day Doctor
What happened to them
He said 'Jack
Yes Doctor
Yes Doctor
Dr Hirsch
HIRSCH Miss Gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
Control What control Get away from me
Leave me alone dammit You people are crazy I 've got to get away from here I 've got to do something
Hopeless It 's hopeless
Sir he 's very upset His friend was killed and
We had an argument He 's being silly
He 's playing a stupid joke sir
David please be rational Let 's go to Dr Hirsch
Jack is dead
David stop
David what are you doing
But
Dr Hirsch will know what to do
The next corner we can get a cab
Do n't you remember
The zoo
I 'm freezing
See you later
A doper werewolf
Okay
Yeah I do but go to work
Werewolves simply do not exist
Tell me that it 's silly of me to be apprehensive
Do me an enormous favor
That 's good Alex Reassure me
I was n't hallucinating
I was awake and he was in my room
Good
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes
Alex
It 's nice to see you
There is only one bed
Lovely
Charming
Very nice
Yeah I would think so too
I was dreaming again
Yeah He says that I will become a monster in two days What do you think
My friend Jack was just here
I 'll let you know the next full moon
A werewolf
Good I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then
You 're being awfully forward are n't you
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient
Now David I said I would keep you company but I meant right here and now
What
David your dreams will stop You 'll leave England and your bad memories and then this will all fade away
That 's easy enough
Do n't be silly Can I get you something
Hello You all right
Yes go on
What Oh yes please
My best friend My very best friend
Now what do you want to talk about
I 'm twenty-seven
How old are you
How old are you
I 'm sorry I should n't have asked you

This is absurd I 'm not hungry I do n't want any food
Call me David
Aw come on Alex

How is that
Please really I 'm not hungry
I 'm not very hungry thank you
Yes
A wolf

The doctor will be round later Would you like a picture book to look at We have some lovely funny Beanos
Feeling better
Well all right then be that way Here swallow this
No what
Hello Benjamin
GALLAGHER I looked
GALLAGHER I think he 's a Jew
GALLAGHER He 's an American you know Dr Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him
GALLAGHER He all right
HOBBS Nothing quite as dramatic as that Miss Price He just does n't eat enough of what is put before him He suffers from nightmares I 'd think he just needs a hand to hold
HOBBS Take these round now will you please The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he 's eaten Will you be sure of that
HOBBS Miss Price
You 're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you
Shakespeare was French The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell Shit Fuck Piss
Queen Elizabeth is a man Prince Charles is a faggot Winston Churchill was full of shit
Hey you asshole I want you to arrest me
You did did you
Why are you doing this to me
That 's easy for you to say you 're already dead
Mr Bringsly I 'm sorry I have absolutely no idea what to say to you
Why are you doing this to me Jack
PLAYER No one brought them here No one wanted them here
PLAYER Oh all right There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York It was full of men from the United Nations
Oh come on tell us
Quiet everyone Hush Shhh
No but we 're about to
GALLAGHER Bambi
GALLAGHER Some everyone does
GALLAGHER An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday and I want to see it badly so you give me no problems and go to sleep
GALLAGHER Miss Price the other nurse that attended you
GALLAGHER It 's nearly eight I 'm off duty shortly then I 'm off to the films with Alex
GALLAGHER Now go back to sleep so you 'll be fresh for Dr Hirsch in the morning
GALLAGHER Mr Kessler Wake up please
Dr Hirsch I 'd rather not be by myself
You really think I 'm crazy do n't you
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb
Did you see Jack
Look Dr Hirsch I know I 've been traumatized but Jack was torn apart I saw him A man ca n't do that to someone with his bare hands
I 've told you it was n't a man It was an animal A big wolf or something A rabid dog
Sure as a kid But never so real Never so bizarre
Doctor my memory is fine It 's my sanity I 'm beginning to worry about
How could there have been witnesses It was so dark We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere I do n't understand what they 're talking about
There were witnesses
Lunatic
Two weeks
How long have I been here
HIRSCH Miss Price Miss Price please
The guy I was with Is he all right How did I get to London
London Where 's Jack I had a strange dream
Where am I
If you did it wrong it would be painful You 'd choke to death
How shall I do it
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway We thought it best you did n't see him as he 's a fresh kill and still pretty messy
David Kessler this is Gerald Bringsly
Well even if I 'm not the wolfman I am crazy enough to do something like that I mean here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse I 'm glad to see you Jack
I did n't mean it I do n't know what I 'm saying I 'm not even sure it was me who killed those people I do n't remember doing it
You look awful
Are n't you going to say I told you so
What can I say Jack
Hi Jack
The canines will be real You 'll taste real blood God damit David please believe me You 'll kill and make others like me I 'm not having a nice time David Do n't allow this to happen again You must take your own life
You must believe me
What do you think
You must take your own life now David before it 's too late
David tomorrow night is the full moon You 'll change you 'll become
Yes
David I 'm sorry I upset you yesterday but you must understand what is going on
I wanted to see you
Do n't be an asshole David Come here
It 's cold David and I 'm so alone The undead surround me Have you ever talked to a corpse It 's boring I 'm lonely Kill yourself David before you kill others
The supernatural The powers of darkness It 's all true Take your own life Suicide David Join me
Listen to me Take your own life David It 's our only chance
David please believe me You will kill people David You 've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins
You 'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night
Beware the moon The full moon David You 've got two days
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said 'Beware the moon
You survived and now you shall continue the curse
It 's you David
The wolf 's bloodline must be severed The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
I was murdered an unnatural death and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf 's curse is lifted
On the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
We were attacked by a werewolf
I 'm a grisly sight it 's true but I love you and that 's why I 'm here You 've got to know
David now I know this may be hard for you but I have to warn you
David
Life mocks me even in death
So you know what she does She 's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine 's bed
Debbie Klein cried a lot
Yeah Your parents came to my funeral I was surprised at how many people came
I 'm sorry to be upsetting you David but I had to come
David You 're hurting my feelings
This is too much I ca n't handle this
Get the fuck out of here Jack
Are you going to help me up
Well I 'm glad we WHOAA
Where are we going
Jack
It sounds far away
See anything
Walk away Jack
A sheep dog or something Turn slowly and let 's walk away
Do you think it 's a dog
Let 's just keep walking
What 's the plan
It 's moving
Come on where
Shit David what is that
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb
No but he was on the moors
Heathcliffe
The Hound of the Baskervilles
A coyote
Could be a lot of things
I heard that
I 'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly
I have no idea
Well not quite a blood-thirsty mob
That was weird I guess leaving was the best idea
Beware the moon
What the hell was that all about
Come on Jack shall we go
Jack we 'd better go
Go on ask them
Right
Listen that 's a pentangle a five pointed star It 's used in witchcraft Lon Chaney Jr and Universal Studios maintain it 's the mark of the wolf man
Ask them what the candles are for
It 's a five-pointed star
Look at that
Nice looking group
Hello
Okay
David before we go in there I want you to know that no matter what happens to us it 's your fault
That 's not a spear It 's a pike
That 's a wolf 's head
The Slaughtered Lamb
We 've known Debbie what since the eighth grade How many years of foreplay is that
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
If you do n't stop I 'm going to kill you
I do n't know
I 'm talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
She 's a jerk
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body
Right
Well I like it here
You 're not having a good time are you
Jack
Yes
VILLIERS Stay here If we need you we 'll know where to reach you
HIRSCH Regardless of what you think Lieutenant the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him
HIRSCH Why do n't we ask him
HIRSCH You were saying
VILLIERS No thank you Doctor
VILLIERS Dr Hirsch
He 's on the telephone
Roger Mathison Doctor
HIRSCH Send them in
HIRSCH Yes
Oh that 's been there for two hundred years We were going to paint it out but it 's traditional so we left it
HIRSCH I suppose Guinness will suffice
HIRSCH Campari and soda would do nicely
I beg your pardon
But I can heat some up for you if you 'd like
No
We 've got spirits and beer If it 's something hot you want you can have tea
No
MCMANUS We 'll find him not to worry
VILLIERS That is precisely my point David as far as we are concerned the matter is closed We wo n't trouble you any further Good day
VILLIERS And what Sergeant
VILLIERS Sgt McManus are you suggesting that David and Jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police We have two witnesses to the crime You 'll forgive me Mr Kessler if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
VILLIERS Has Mr Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
MCMANUS I 'd like some tea please
Yeah sure
If she ca n't pay I 'll have to foreclose wo n't I
She 's a widow I do n't like taking mortgages from widows
But listen Tom I
Tom I never had trouble getting credit from you before When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted Now I come to you with a swell deal and the greatest
Listen I told you I was n't interested in that deal did n't I
You here again What do you want
Yeah
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson 's office
Matt
No kidding When I saw it you could a knocked me over with a pin
I was the first one to see it I was coming down the stairs and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet
Say do n't annoy me I got troubles of my own
Yeah
I 'm fourteen cents out and it took me half an hour to find the mistake And me with a date too
Where do you think I 've been I took the baby for a stroll in the park
Aw nerts
It 'll be yours if you do n't kick in with that ten bucks
Baby I ca n't give you anything but love
Yeah
Ten bucks Say if I had ten bucks I 'd quit
Yeah
Here 's twenty-five thousand
It was more than that last week
How much
Yes sir
Yes sir
Not yet Mr Clark
All right let him I 'm sick and tired of hearing about him If he wants to run the bank let him do it I do n't want any part of it
Take it easy Clark
What good will that do Why it will take control away from him We 'll put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again That 's what good it will do
Dickson does n't have to go But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Oh is he We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city We 're fools to tolerate it
You know what you can do with that Come on take a look at this You 'll see a demonstration of faith that 's worth more than all the collateral in the world
Come out here you pawnbrokers take a look at this
Dickson I 'd like to talk to you about the bank
Say you ca n't do that
No You ca n't reason with anyone else when you 're in a jam We pleaded with you to keep liquid but you would n't listen to us You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish Now you want our help You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you 've wrecked All right There 's one way you can get it Give us an option on your stock and resign as president
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you You thought they were your friends Why do n't you go out there now and try and get some help from them
That sounds very simple Dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
What do you mean help
We 'll discuss that in the board room
We want to talk to you
Gentlemen you notice Mr Dickson refuses to consider our wishes He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as as faith
I know Dickson That 's all very well But you 're taking too many chances In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble In case of emergency
Not at all That 's Alexander Hamilton 's idea 5 the finest banking mind this country has ever known Those are his exact words gentlemen Character It 's the only thing you can bank on and it 's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
Just pure luck
Oh you would eh All right If it 's more important than golf go ahead What 's on your mind
Say you know I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball You 've got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out it 's the only way you can hit anything
Claims he was there with a married woman Does n't want to mention her name
Do n't forget there 's a dead watchman downstairs
They took my keys yesterday I went there to get them back
Stand back Inspector Let me out of here or I 'll shoot you
All right Jack all right
It 's one of the boys from headquarters He always sings Mother Machree whenever he 's got good news Looks like this case 'll be settled in no time
Thanks
You understand
If you do n't mind Inspector I 'd rather not say that is unless it becomes absolutely essential You see she 's married
Oh yes of course There was someone with me A lady
That 's very simple I was home
Of course yes Just what would you like to know Inspector
Get out get out
She just came up for a drink Just for a few minutes
Nothing nothing Mr Dickson Do n't pay any attention to me I do n't know what I 'm saying
But I did n't kill that man last night Honest I did n't Mr Dickson
Gambling I owed them a lot of money Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars
I do n't know It 's all been like a crazy nightmare Mr Dickson
Listen buddy you 're getting by pretty easy Quit squawking
Be sure you 're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked Understand
You No you 'll be all right so long as you establish an alibi for tonight
All you got ta do is fix a few things for us and we 'll do the rest see
You do n't have to do nothing
Why not
We can take blood from anything  If it 's comin to us
That do n't do us any good

We have n't got much time left Mr Dickson We 've got to do something quick or it 'll be too late

Wait a minute Wait a minute Matt do you realize you 're up against something You 're being charged with murder It 's serious son Now come on I know you did n't do it But we 've got to make them believe it Come on tell the truth where were you last night
I already told him I was home
Well I
Aw I 'm sorry Mr Dickson It 's just kind of sudden that 's all Sure I 'm excited I think it 's great Only well you 've done so much for me already I 'll never be able to thank you enough

You do n't want to check up on anybody I 'll do all the checking up Wait a minute
You 're lying

Listen Matt If you do n't tell the truth I ca n't help you Where were you last night
So have you So have I So 's everybody got a record What difference does that make You ca n't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
What are you talking about He had no more to do with it than you did
Good You 've got nothing to worry about Soon as the report comes in you 'll be released And listen do n't talk so loud Take it easy Coast a little
Why certainly he can Matt now all you 've got to do is tell them where you were last night between twelve and twelve-thirty and everything will be all right
All right If the boy proves an alibi he 's all right is n't he
What time did this thing happen
It 's an inside job That 's a cinch Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout Now Brown here is in charge of the vaults is n't he
I 'm afraid I must Mr Dickson
I hate to do this but I 've got to have time to dig up some help I think I know where I can get some real cash Snap into it Sampson We will lick this thing yet
Get all the big bills in the place Take them out and get them changed Get nothing but ones and fives Distribute them among the tellers Tell them to take their time Stall as much as possible Count and recount the money
Do n't you think I know it
I 'll talk to them Listen go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said Tell 'em to verify every signature
The fools If they only knew it they 're making things worse for themselves Somebody starts a silly rumor and they lose their heads
Mine too
Did you get the case for the securities
Yes sir
We have n't much on hand you know If it gets any worse I hope we do n't have to close the doors
They 've been coming in steady all morning I have called for some extra police
The lobby 's half filled now
How about his nights He 's too busy running around Tell him to keep tomorrow night open come in and sign this thing or I 'll call this whole deal off
That 's just exactly what he has been doing This deal should have been closed weeks ago Tell him to keep tomorrow open
Good I 'll take this along with me Tell Clyde I 'll see him tomorrow I 'm sick and tired of the delay
Well Sampson what is it
But you said it would be safe It 's his life insurance money Oh please I 'll go to the Old Ladies Home if you do n't do something please
It 's his life insurance money you know
Is it safe
All right
Hardly
No
I 'm afraid so
He 's at a board meeting
How-do-you-do Mrs Dickson
The big guys have got the screws on him You 've got to come through for him Mr Conway He came through for you a hundred times If his friends do n't help him who is going to help him
Dickson 's in a jam I tell you The run 's getting worse
Did you talk to him
Yes He called some of the biggest people in town
Something 's happened He is n't trying anymore
Do n't cry honey Everything 's gon na be all right
All right dear
Okay honey but just the same I 'd like to take a crack at that
Can you imagine that guy He was kissing her
Who Cluett No not yet But I 'd like to take a crack at that stiff necked horse dollar 6
Oh Charlie again
Yes right in his office the rat I 'd like to take a crack at that guy

He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay 's joint
I 've been trailing the cashier like you told me You 're right about that guy chief There 's something screwy somewhere
That 's all Mrs Halligan Thanks
There you are
Yes I know Cause the Dooley sisters were n't in yet
It could n't have been earlier

What time was it Mrs Halligan
HALLIGAN Sure I do He has the best room in me house The one with the fancy wallpaper
Then where were you

Certainly Mr Jones Certainly Charlie
Where 's Charlie
Everybody in

You 've got enough
How are you fixed
You 're carrying too much money on you Hank You better turn some in tonight
TOM Sometimes a wound will kill
Jim Younger I told you
Tom I 'm this close to coming with you
TOM I said like a Comanche not this Comanche
It 's tougher than it looks
Things changed when you quit the gang For example I 'm now the one who says Let 's ride
I 'm sorry Cole
I swear
Bob I did n't
I ai n't done
How 'd they
Cole we 're outlaws Not exactly the most respectable job if you know what I mean
That was because of the reputation the gang had
This is the best score yet
That 's what the newspapers say Were n't for Jesse James this gang would n't be able to find a goat 's ass with a stick
We got a problem here brother
How
You stay out of this Bob
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men
Our place Clell Miller 's Sammy Johnston the Creeders Will Hite
Here 's Liberty 's favorite son I 'll never forget what you did cousin
Your Ma would n't let us leave until we ate something
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty
He 's smiling
Gatling They 've got a Gatling
The Army can hang him
Damn
Oh no
Stop by our spread after that tell our Ma we 're all right We 'll go to Doc Mimms
Will Perry
Then I love it
Corn gon na shoot at me
Yesterday
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine thank you
Listen he 's my brother and I do n't want to start trouble
He 's planning a job
Listen Jesse we 've got a problem It 's Cole
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here
This is about the Wanted Posters is n't it
Beg pardon
Okay folks I think we know how this is going to go
Hey
We oughta take some of this give it to our neighbors in Liberty Lot of people hurting up there
All right settle down All this money ai n't ours
But if we take their money and supplies
You have no shame
How many of them did he kill
Home We go home We ride like hell to get there and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again
DETECTIVE You shut up now boy
DETECTIVE How
DETECTIVE What you sayin boy
DETECTIVE What
Where 'd you get all these riders
You know you gettin caught right after leaving us some people thought
Missed you cousin
WHAT We follow you for a year and now that our blood 's been spilled you 're gon na quit
We 'll make them pay for this
Bob rip up some bandages
Okay you 're gon na rest here
Dammit
Fine We hit this bank
Still smells fishy
I 'm the better soldier Jesse
And almost got hanged in peacetime
A bad idea
Beautiful
I 've robbed just as many banks as you have I know this town and I know this bank and I say it 's an easy job
If you 'd read about it first you 'd have no problems
What will be
Hold on hold on we all know Bob is an important part of the gang
Why are n't we the Younger-James Gang I mean there 's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the James-Younger Gang
Jesse we got to have a word
The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men
It 's not a bank
See Frank 's being smart about this
I got seven thousand
Sorry
Let 's ride
I 'll pick the first job I mean I know a girl down at the bank See if she ca n't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money
So what do we do General Lee
Yeah
But it was a whole lot of killing Why should we miss that
The war What are you crazy There are things I miss about it
Thanks for the help
She was European
She got two of them
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches I do n't want them to see us coming
Not now
You 're not scared are you
Planting corn Harvesting corn Year after year
There 's Yankees back there Lot 's of 'em
Suit yourself We 'll have some horses waiting for you at the road Let 's ride Rangers
Ride with me cousin
'Bout time you got here buddy
Well
Tom why do n't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation Figure we might have some work for you if you want
Wait 'll we get back to Missouri start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be Tom
They gon na rush us
Cole he did n't mean that
Jesse
Strategically
Get buckets
Ah
I have no idea what you just said but it sounded real nice
Oh Lord the dance hall girl at Bunty 's
Which one right or left
Must be a garrison in town We 're in occupied territory boys
Soon as I hit one the other 'll know and beat us up
Cannon or Gatling
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE
Where is Jesse James
Of course Uh sir
TOM Me get heap firewater
TOM Ho-yah
TOM Ho-yah Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun above Great River near Eagle Rock
The District Marshall
Yeah Injun What do you want
TOM I 'd appreciate that
TOM It 's a secret
TOM On account of we 're robbing it
TOM You 're right sir
Shit
Where the hell were you
So
What is it
MIMMS It 's fine by me Jesse
MIMMS You know you 're welcome any time
What do you say sir
MIMMS Boys
MIMMS Web died fighting
MIMMS My little Web did that
MIMMS I 'm upset too Zee but Jesse and Cole know what they 're doing I 'm sure they wo n't press their luck
I think he 's already feeling better
I fooled them into thinking I was alone
MIMMS The bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood Praying would n't hurt
MIMMS Zerelda it 's no coincidence The railroad men come through offering to buy up land Nobody sells Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason
Hell they hardly even noticed us
I 'll meet you down there in a few weeks
A war against the railroad What the hell were we thinking
You 're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West How was he supposed to say no to that
Shoulda learned with Web Made it look fun made it look like an adventure Got Web killed Now Jim
They 're all pinned down Ca n't even get to the door
You taking sides against me now Frank
Oh yeah
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee
Maybe it started out that way But now
I ca n't quit and leave you alone I ca n't quit until you quit Ma would 've wanted it that way
If I could go back to farming
It got to you did n't it All the killing in the war You need it now
Jesse we 're outlaws
Bob here 'll kill a man for sneezing and he 's the best shot in the gang
The posters
Gents we are in the middle of something here
I do n't think it 's counterfeit Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare
And it 's guarded by Pinkerton detectives
And I planned getting you off the hangman 's deck
Fine How 'd it go out here
Make a thousand of 'em Still wo n't be enough by the time I 'm through
Do n't care
Ma
Shut up Uh Doc I was wondering if uh this evening I could come by
Would you get in the carriage Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself she 's gon na make me miserable
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed The railroad does n't even need our land they 're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can
You know him
if you stop saying things about my Zee
She 's still talking to Jesus
I swear I 'll shoot you in your sleep
You can shut up now
Maybe maybe
What kind of story are they going to believe
All we thought about was coming home I swore I 'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay fine by me
Whyyyy he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself
You 're doing just fine
We better go to Doc 's see what 's going on here
All this time in the saddle We get to the farm I 'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
I reckoned
No Jesse your problem is you 're always doing stuff before I 'm finished figuring it out
I figure
You could have worn one of those big floppy woman 's Easter Sunday hats
Mm-hmm
Pff They hardly even noticed you
So we got a plan
Everything but the boring parts
Yeah Jimmy
I think he was just a real interestin fella to have around
Ca n't argue that
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad
That he was
Allow a man his version of the past When you get to be my age you 've got enough painful memories you 're allowed to soften a few of the edges up
every time you tell that story you stop there That 's not how it ended I was five when my dad got shot
Y'know Uncle Frank
Doc Mimms will
We know Ma Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms
Boys
Somebody 's in a vengeful smiting mood today
We 're just fine thank you sir
He 's a good Christian and he killed Yankees Jesus told me that made him an all right boy
Say your prayers
Did you kill Yankees
Tennessee
Do n't swear
I ca n't believe I had to blow up a train for you
You get arrested again I 'll kill you
What
Swimming Swimming is good
Aw shucks ma'am
Now sweetie y'all would n't go believing one of them silly dime novels would you
Let me see that
I beg your pardon
Hmm what
Now wait a minute There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding
Are you going to be happy here Mr James Without all that excitement
I would never have imagined us in a place like this
That 's wonderful It 's just I thought
I do n't understand
Jesse What are you thinking There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
When my name makes them cry in their sleep When I 've brought them to ashes
Laws do n't touch men like Thaddeus Rains Only justice does
Me neither
Frank and me have to go away for a while
I 've been planning on kissin you for a very long time
Yep
Little ones
Ahem From this doctrine No ah From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive they sparkle still like shiny sparkling rocks
Where will you find such a girl
And what 's this right girl like
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life Jesse James
Thank God you grew out of that You did grow out of that did n't you
A river pirate
You did n't want to farm
Unfair You are completely unfair
I was n't the only one risking my neck that day
What
What you do to me is unfair The teasing I mean
No I mean of course not No
I 've been on my back two weeks I 'm sick of it
Nuh-huh
Mmmm
If there 's anything we can do for you Dr Mimms We want to help
But you got big
Zerelda Little Zee Mimms
I 'd just as soon kill you Jesse James But chasing you takes up too much of my time
The railroad has no business in Tennessee Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee
That was for my Ma Now this is for everybody else
Ahh you 'll miss me
I 'm not hanged yet
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it
I figured
No that one was close A couple fellas quit after that one
Almost got me in Billings I saw you there shooting at me
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town
You had all those cattle there so I 'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive
Last February
Pity
Not that day I am guilty of many things but that was Mr Thaddeus Rains and Parker that day
That 's the idea
Oh it 's a similar room But the hotel is in Washington D.C You 're not going to get a fair trial down here in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers
We 're moving you tomorrow
Right here in church
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof
Discretion Sir I am a man of the cloth
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable Jesse Woodson James Jesse James The Jesse James
This is unusual Most of our marriages are members of the congregation
Jesse you explain to Lyla My girl you know from that time
too young for whisky
What about that Rock Island bastard
Tell you something else I ca n't drink that good neither I 'm going to go outside and throw up
You and Frank and Cole and even Bob get all these girls because you 're good looking and famous You do n't have to pay They just look at me like I 'm the baby brother Do n't tell anyone okay Jesse
Hell yeah I been with Uh not exactly It 's just I do n't want to get one of these paid ladies you know
Well not exactly
Jim you been with a girl yet
I guess so
Yeah Hey are you drinking whisky You 're too young to be drinking whisky
No
And the same age Web was No
And you 're too young
Really
That is so gentlemanly of you
Could we go upstairs and talk It 's so loud down here
Lyla Devereux
I just though you were awful cute
I hope I 'm not being too forward
Yes but just so I could find out who you were
I hope you do n't mind Jesse James told me your name
Move you fools
They donate money to farmers to churches Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school
By burning down their homes
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
Relax Alan The Army has this all in hand And Mr Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate
Well this land is about to be condemned
How did you know
This is him
That
What is that
Parker
The final route for the railroad is complete
With my money
Your men knew the risks
THEN WHO DID
I 'll kill them for blowing up my railway
How much did they get from the safe
I 'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool I see a power void to be filled As we have the most power we may move with impunity
Just perfect
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers
Good
Parker tell me what 's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars not necessarily in that order
NO It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you can not seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen
And it is my pleasure to be here
Vengeance
Why their intense hatred of you of course
No need I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
Every three months the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty Missouri They always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends
So he 's won
Ca n't you tell me anything
I demand action
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly as heroes
First of all you shut up Now you 've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover Every time the James Gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area But there 's just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in This gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs
Pinkerton It 's been eight months I see robberies I see hold ups But I do not see men on the end of nooses
So you ca n't tell me anything
I 'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
Oh that 's the best part
It is a nice piece of writing
I 'm afraid our adversaries do n't agree
Would a jury around here convict their own I think not We 're beginning an interesting game here Mr Rains
Oh no I would have done that But I would have made sure I killed them too
Not to mention my men who lost their lives
Nothing
Patrick
Is n't that special Patrick
Listen Patrick Can we talk
I never knew you smoked
You and Luis
Dinner at the River Cafe Au Bar afterwards maybe

I 'm not supposed to But I can make an exception
Would you like to see my apartment

Oh God I ca n't believe this
I know my behavior is erratic sometimes

We never really shared one
Yes I am
I know that your friends are my friends I 've thought about that You can have them
I 'm fucking serious It 's fucking over Us This is no joke I do n't think we should see each other anymore
It 's over Evelyn It 's all over

WOLFE Do n't come back
But I think I want to know what happened here
WOLFE There was no ad in the Times
WOLFE You saw the ad in the Times
WOLFE No he does n't
I 'm looking for Paul Owen 's place
No
Now if you 'll excuse me
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London just ten days ago
It 's just not
But that 's simply not possible And I do n't find this funny anymore
No Listen do n't you know who I am I 'm not Davis I 'm Patrick Bateman I talk to you on the phone all the time Do n't you recognize me You 're my lawyer
Wait Stop You do n't seem to understand You 're not really comprehending any of this I killed him I did it Carnes I 'm Patrick Bateman I chopped Owen 's fucking head off I tortured dozens of girls The whole message I left on your machine was true
Oh Christ He can barely pick up an escort girl let alone what was it you said he did to her
Davis I 'm not one to bad-mouth anyone your joke was amusing But come on man you had one fatal flaw Bateman 's such a dork such a boring spineless lightweight that I could n't fully appreciate it I was n't fooled for a second Now if you 'd said Price or McDermott Otherwise it was amusing Now let 's have lunch or dinner or something Hilarious Davis A killer
But wait Harold what do you mean
The message you left
It was a pretty long message was n't it
Yes naturally
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s
What CARRUTHERS I 'll call you
I 've got ta I 've got ta return some videotapes
What is it

What 's that a gram
Like what
I guess you 're right THAT IS IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT 'S OKAY
SHUT UP
It 's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we 'll be okay
What
Maybe it 's just the light
Oh who knows They do n't know that Prove it
There 's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer 's muscular dystrophy hemophilia leukemia diabetes dyslexia for Christ 's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy
That 's Paul Owen

Sorry
Patrick have you ever wanted to make someone happy
What 's that
Who 's Ted Bundy
Growing I 'm glad you said that
Jean do you feel fulfilled I mean in your life
Are you seeing anyone I mean seriously
No not really
Well I 'd like to travel And maybe go back to school but I really do n't know I 'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities but I 'm so I do n't know unsure
No It 's all right I 'm not very good at controlling it anyway
You can always he thinner Look better
I 'm on a diet But thank you
Thanks Patrick I 'd love some
They know me
Yes You 're dressed okay
Oh I do n't know No we 'll go anywhere you want
Come on Where do you want to go Anywhere you want Just say it I can get us in anywhere
No come on Anywhere you want
Let 's not think about what I want How about anywhere you want
Well is n't this a coincidence
That is if you 're not doing anything
Yes Patrick
Bring us an ashtray for Mr KIMBALL please She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence
Can you bring Mr
Patrick I think he knows you 're here It 's only ten-thirty
Detective Donald KIMBALL

Patrick
Thanks Patrick
You do n't like this I take it
Ummm what I did n't hear you
Yes

Oh And what should I say
After six
And Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today He did n't say what he was canceling or why
Late
No I really do n't
What
That 's that 's too bad
Well most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions do n't really like it
I m into well murders and executions mostly
No Flattering but no
What do you think I do
Okay Do
Yeah
Well what about oh you know maybe a Saturday
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week You know I 'm downtown near Wall Street quite often
Hubert 's Oh really It moved uptown right
Oh yeah Oh I get it Fun with chocolate
Then why ca n't they get these stains out I mean can you talk to these people or something I 'm not getting anywhere
Well
Hi Patrick I thought that was you
Did you know that Whitney Houston 's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it Did you know that Christie Whitney 's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she 's mainly a jazz singer-that it 's hard to take in the album on a first listening
Well you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing
Are you telling me you 've never gotten it on with a girl
Come on I think it would be a turn-on
Come on Do n't you find Christie attractive
Listen I would just like to see the two of you get it on What 's wrong with that It 's totally disease-free
No
I want the number idiot Anyway I 'm at Paul Norman 's and I 'll try you later and if I do n't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I 'm going to sic my hairdresser on you
Who
This tastes weird Harley It 's me I need your services Translate that anyway you 'd like I 'm at
Do n't tell him you 're here
Elizabeth it 's three in the morning
Uh huh
If you had an American Express card she 'd give you a blowjob Listen this girl worked in a tanning salon need I say more What do you do
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso Split town for a while Maybe he did go to London Sightseeing Drinking Whatever Anyway I 'm pretty sure he 'll turn up sooner or later I mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous Is n't that right Patrick
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott Frederick Dibble Harry Newman George Butner and  you
He was n't with Paul Owen
Oh KIMBALL Now where were you
He does You 're sure
Well does Marcus have an alibi
But Marcus denied it
Marcus
And
But how Where do you place Paul that night
I 'm not really sure I had a shower and some sorbet
Suit yourself I guess
But everyone orders the hash browns here I mean it's-have you been here before
No hash browns
Well to each his own So-lunch Thursday I 'll call your secretary about reservations
Not a big music fan eh
Absolutely I 'm with you on that one
Great yes I 'd like that
Patrick please I hope I 've been informative Long day-a bit scattered
We had gone to a new musical called Oh Africa Brave Africa It was a laugh riot and that 's about it I think we had dinner at Orso 's No Petaluma No Orso 's The last time I physically saw him was at an automated teller I ca n't remember which just one that was near um Nell 's
Well I could he wrong
Well I Wait What information have you received
What
I had a date with a girl named Veronica
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul 's disappearance Which was on the twentieth of December
Yeah gone into rehab Shame Is he a suspect
Dan great to see you again Like I said you need anything at all I 'm your man I do n't envy your job I mean Owen was a complex man
Too true You know Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they 're in a relaxed setting do n't you think
0h no Informal conversations mostly What 's that Stoli
Uh yes I mean whenever necessary You know
Don
Great and thanks for your uh time Mr Bateman
Listen if anything occurs to you any information at all
Uh no There 's one down here
You 'll have to excuse me I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes
The earth just opens up and swallows people
Nothing
That 's so typical is n't it
I mean no one 's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right
Had his apartment been burglarized
Have you consulted a psychic
Yikes No Paul was n't into that He followed a balanced diet and
What
Oh
Hmmm
But has anyone seen him in London
Well maybe he did huh
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints
We were both seven in 1969
I just wanted to know if you know BATEMAN Before Yale If I remember correctly Saint Paul 's Listen I just I just want to help
And where did he go to school
He had a yacht
Yeah You know hang out
Where did Paul hang out
Do you feel that way
What kind of man was he Besides the information you 've just given
So there 's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen
Yeah Yale thing
I 'm at a loss He was part of that whole Yale thing you know
Well
No problem
No I guess it 's okay
I know I 'm sorry
You seem nervous
Pardon me but are you okay
Nice Very nice
Your address
Where did you go to school
How old are you
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files okay
No really I 'm okay
I think his family wants this kept quiet
The disappearance of Paul Owen
It 's no problem
Mr Kimball a bottle of San Pelle
No I 'm okay
No I 'm okay
So it 's nothing that official I just have some basic questions About Paul Owen About yourself
Nothing like that I 'm just a private investigator
I 've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen
I 'm sorry to barge in on you like this but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he was n't in and well you 're here so I know how busy you guys can get
Hi I 'm Donald KIMBALL
No I 'm sorry I should 've made an appointment Was that anything important
You reek You reek of shit Do you know that Goddammit Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot Al I 'm sorry
Do you know how bad you smell The stench my God
Shhhh it 's okay
Get a goddamn job Al You 've got a negative attitude That 's what 's stopping you You 've got to get your act together I 'll help you
Speak up Come on
Listen what 's your name
Listen do you think it 's fair to take money from people who do have jobs From people who do work
I know that I know that Jeez you 're like a broken record I 'm trying to help you
You 're not what Qualified for anything else
Why do n't you get another one Why do n't you get another job
Gee uh that 's too bad
MAN I lost my job
MAN I 'm so hungry
MAN I 'm so hungry
Is that a raincoat
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place Do you have a dog A chow or something
Hey Halberstam
You like Huey Lewis and the News
No man I 'm gon na bail
Paul give me your Amex card Good boy Bateman slaps the card down looks at the check
Evelyn Great ass Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman What a dork
And Cecelia how is she Where is she tonight
So was n't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account How did you get it
We should 've gone to Dorsia I could 've gotten us a table
Yeah well you 're late
Oh yes I 'm very lucky
Oh well you know
It 's it 's all right
I 've been great And you
PATTEN Some guys are just born cool I guess
I do n't believe it He looks so normal He seems so out of it So undangerous
How can he lie like that How can he pull that shit
You 'll look like you consciously worked for the look
Anything That 's not even credible If he wants to go up there To check it out I think you should encourage him It 's his life But everybody 's treating him like this valuable object You 're hurting your own case
I can paint anywhere
You know what he 's like He just wants to work on stuff that 's cool
You know what I mean
Alice You got ta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me
You are a fanatic
Is it over
Right Wait A toast
wan na savor this
Here we go
Do n't we have any chopsticks
I know you You 're gon na run back to work right after dinner I want my kiss now
Yeah Give me a goodbye kiss
Look at me I 'm gon na change
Just shut up
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary 's office You know Just to hold it again
Milo you
Milo
He has thousands of employees Milo
What
Okay yeah I did something naughty There 's this amazing Comix store in Seattle To tell you the truth I did it once or twice at Stanford 'Guess I ca n't keep anything from you
Different
Poor baby You know that 's not true
Guilt
I remember
Remember Lyle Barton
It 's what they said it is An unfinished broadcast studio You were right I just drove to Seattle and back
Nothing
So you believe me
I know how to get in there But you 've got ta help me
They stop the construction work at six or seven The parking lot 's mostly clear by two or three in the morning Even the early Geeks do n't get there before five
I ca n't just walk away
It 's the only one with dishes on the roof The studio 's a front That 's why they keep postponing its opening got ta get in there
How should I know Solving a problem I guess Or needing to control everything I do n't know I 've got ta get in there
You think I do n't know that
Go where You ca n't get away from people like this
It is n't a broadcast studio It 's a surveillance post or something That 's why they have the dishes on top
They hack into people 's programs
I ca n't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death Nelson said it was an airtight case
What 're you what
What
I mean if one little comment from Gary is gon na upset you this much
Is n't that extreme
I know I know
That 's what I 'm asking myself Does he have some genius stowed away Why not let him write Skywire 'Not saying it makes sense
It 's the way he said it Just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie That 's how you knew you were onto something ugly
That 's what I need to ask you You know you ca n't keep anything from me
Milo What about
We 're not gon na let it
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call We 'll leave it for him
You saved my life in alot of ways
C'mon I would n't have a destiny without you My destiny would be dying at 20 From eating
I forgot That 's why you have to help me decide
But
If my dad 'd leveled with me like that even once The weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary It 's his fantasy too
When I was a kid And he was moving us all over the place I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0 I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest
If he 's really a bully he wo n't cop to it anyway
Then you 've got ta ask him about that
C'mon how often do you talk to somebody who 's been on the cover of Time Three of four times
I do n't think he knows how
He said it made sense that Gary 's code was like Teddy 's that that cliché about great minds was true Said it was all about his own guilt Plus he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while It always passes
Lisa 's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team We 've got our eyes on her You keep yours on Milo
That 'll be a test wo n't it
Not like him is it To do a thing like that without telling you You 're not losing your hold on him are you
'Did n't mention he was going to the Justice Department
And Outpost You 're happy there
Let me look into it see what 's being done Frankly it 's not my area
If there 's a Civil Rights violation But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first
My goodness
Milo
What seems to be the problem You look a little upset
Yeah Hi Thank you for seeing me
Give me two seconds with Lacy here Go on in I wo n't be a moment
It 's Milo is n't it
Like I said shot in the dark
Beggar We 're at a disadvantage with Outpost Our experts are n't as smart as theirs Sometimes we ca n't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights I 'm taking a shot in the dark here I can offer you 32,000 a year a Buick I 'm hoping you 've got a feeling it 's the right thing to do
Do n't worry Milo I 'm here as a friend Or maybe a supplicant
When did you know
What
Is it your software
You 're interfaced with our dish
What
Okay
What
Will I get to work for Outpost
You ca n't pre-empt Yoga that 's our biggest show
'Forgot to introduce you I have a girlfriend
Sure I 'll see what I can do
You 're living here
KING We tried
KING And the kid who wrote Skywire then gave it away They 're calling him the digital Robin Hood
KING Is n't there a stigma Bankrolling this guy
KING That 'd change with a criminal indictment
KING Outpost does n't own em
KING That 's got ta kill him right
Who 's that
We could move 'em up here
'Could n't convince Teddy to come
Milo I 'm Danny
I 'm pretty close But when I wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer You know what it 's like writing software
I hope you know what you mean to me Not just because of what you 're doing Because of who you are
Gary I
I 'm not much good at handwriting Or parties
I could n't do it at work cause of security or at home for obvious reasons
'Sorry about the late notice
Do n't be so hard on yourself With a brain like yours you could connive with the best of 'em I bet
Worse
What would you tell the kids At your new school You had to come up with a good story right
Why did you move around so much When you were a kid
'Have a look
You look a little tired
The answer 's not in the box It 's in the band
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler And it came over me it 's in the wrong place
Wow You must have 20,000 lines of code there
You 've been coming in early
I meant did you find other stuff to
Did you
Had you talked to him much lately
I heard what happened
It scales do n't you think
I 'm sure
Nothing
You really wrote this just today
Well you sent for me
You 're making me young again
Take a look at this Slightly different approach
Too fast At least four companies 're on the verge of workable convergence systems Milo they
How 's it going
Could work with a new switch There may be a few more things hidden
That 's insane You 're ahead of your time
Do I
Okay I 'm Gary
Yeah I wan na feel like I did when I wrote that But I 'm 42 that 's 100 in cyber-years I look at you and see the things that got me here But somehow got away
When you get to a certain age you start wondering About your legacy I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0
It needs a more object-oriented language This does n't scale does it
Skywire
Low enough to relay internet traffic
There 's a rumor going around maybe you 've heard it
Oh No thanks
Cool
Milo Gary Boyd I 'm hoping you and your friend can come up here We 've made some amazing strides in digital convergence I 'd love to show them to you
Just do it
'Knows I 'm altering the coordinates Let 's jump to 12
Wait He knows
Let 's go
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes
Just do what I 'm asking
Help me change the Skywire settings Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
Has n't affected his work though
What 'd the girl say
'Start-up not 50 miles from here Kid 's on Prozac
Cool
Got out of my other commitment
We 'll come up with the next big thing
Those really weird short lines
It 's only meaningful when you 've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up
Just thought his work should go on
I know you lost all his work Maybe I could come down here and
You do
In exchange for endowments They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em
I launched Skywire Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary 's satellite
Where we going
I 'm calling Gary
They know 'Just they do n't trust me with it So we 'll get the evidence first ask questions later
Let 's get him in here
Any irregularity in the pattern
Keep looking
Not yet 'Love to bust my ass cause I 'm not in frigging Mensa I swear to God it 's that kid Milo I told 'em so in the first place but they did n't even wan na hear about it Let 's run a printout on card entries
Could it be a glitch Something the construction workers caused
Latitude 47 degrees
What
Let 's try 2
But you said the other
It 's three years old it
Tell me you 're not calling on your car phone
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary
She called to apologize I said I was pulling an all-nighter She said then come home just to say Hi Which I always do when we fight it 's suspicious if I do n't
He suspects I know something I think he was sort of explaining himself to me in case I do We have to go in tonight I 'm two hours from a Beta version But I 've got ta go home for an hour
You 'll come up with something
You could always say you have to go the bathroom
Same with the excerpts I 'm choosing they 'll play against any of the images you described
Oh
Hardly anybody does that 's the beauty part No cameras the DOJ does n't bother with it it 's accessed by a tunnel they boast about You know the best place to hide a leaf
They know I broke in Alice helped me Shrot 's not one of them He 's blundering into this on his own
Thank God
Great I knocked off the aglet as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we 're there
I felt guilty 'Cause I owed so much to Alice But even then I was starting to wonder Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you If you have a lucrative skill it 's all anybody wants from you You grow older but you do n't grow up You turn into into
What 'd he say
'Cause their apartments might be bugged
Oh I liked you I was checking you out
I thought the worst they would do is fire me Who knew they took termination so literally
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 are n't hot yet You said the place is n't finished
You mean break in
Before they kill somebody else too
It 's a standard GUI Once I 've got a concept it 's maybe three day 's work
But they 'd still get the idea right
A what
He 's got 12 satellites up He 's got dishes on top of 21 He 's building this mega-network for Skywire Let 's use it
How close are you
Time
But still you ca n't say CBS would n't love to break something like
What about 60 Minutes
Certainly not at my happy home
Right But Gary 's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates Have to be careful who we pick
There 're so many disinformation sites about Gary already Where he has devil 's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein
There 's always a logical answer you just have to define the question
They 've got this guy in the DOJ maybe others We tell the wrong person it 's over
No no Never
Hmm
They 're already watching you If they had to they 'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout He 'd wake up not even remembering his act of revenge
They 'd frame him
Oh yeah
You know There is no second place And what 's the risk The killings 're undetectable they 're hand-tailored they make sense I mean they 're in the information business They have scenarios for all of us too In case we find out too much
It 's easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell 'em They upload medical files school records pharmacy files They 'd be happy just to steal code forever But when a program gets close to fruition Like Teddy He was almost there
You thought about it too You 've been suspicious for a while But it 's not happening in there It 's happening in the Day Care
I snuck into 21
That 's great I did n't know
So when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers Was that then Or now
Why 's that
You 're compulsive
Right right But does he ever just like hand you code
There is no second place Plus every time I get jammed-up Gary has an inspiration Is it like that with your counselor
No Please
Yeah I ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to
Show me
What 've you got there
Did I say something
Something like that Yeah
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers
I would n't worry about it You 've got ta figure most people around here were their teachers pets
You 're famous around here
You know my name
I did n't plan this
What does that mean
What d'you mean
No I keep thinking it 'll go away But there 's this connection She 's been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot Plus I see her every day we 're working on the same program She 's beautiful
I do n't know
I met this girl
Jesus Teddy
What
Outpost made me sign 1,000 'Guess we 'll find out what else we have to talk about Life stuff
Hey we got seed money for the startup A million-five
Uh Not exactly
And your phone messages You wan na do what you do it 's not a crime
You wan na survive in the software business you cover your bets I got ta say this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
21 Way behind schedule It 's top secret but everybody knows it 's a digital broadcast space They see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
Right That 's rare around here You know how nuns re-married to Jesus 'Posties are married to Outpost
Heavy graphical background doing design-interface for Skywire apps You 'll be working with her
Every geek here 's got a thing for Lisa But that 's about the biggest reaction she 's had to anybody
His Snapples were in alphabetical order
Oh we 're not going to the campus
You do n't look anything like a three year-old
Did you download Corey In San Jose
Speaking of which
There is no public offering The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo 'Wrote this just to run their web site
We tried the big vaporware number Gary it 's no-sale
Wait a second I 'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
We 're too late Take a look
Who 're these guys
I could get it out of him
Unless it 's a diversion Milo 's in my office He was tailgating so I
Not much Glorified cherry bomb Right by the civil defense sign Some geek 's idea of irony I been saying we need a camera in this hall
Oh you 're very clever Let 's make love you silly hairy little man
I 'll tell you all in due time after we make love But first tell me another poem
Yes
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question
To my health
'Milk milk lemonade Round the corner fudge is made Stick your finger in the hole And out comes a tootsie roll
'Pardon me for being rude It was not me it was my food It just popped up to say hello and now it 's gone back down below
How do you feel Mr Cunningham
Care for some saki
In Japan men come first and women come second
May I wash you
I 'd rather talk about Number Two
Behave
I did n't baby you just told me
Your boss Number Two I understand that cat 's involved in big underground drills
Call me Ritchie Miss Fagina May I call you Alotta Please
What and watch all my earnings go Down the toilet
You seem surprised to see me

Man you are one chilly square
It seems the tables have turned again Dr Evil
That 's why right now is a very groovy time man We still have freedom but we also have responsibility
No man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination We were innocent man If we 'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same It 's freedom man
I 've got you Dr Evil

Kiss me
I love you Austin

First I plan to soil myself Then I plan to regroup and think about the next move Any thoughts
Does that make you horny
Thank God Austin we made it
Austin we do n't look anything like our photo badges
No Do n't lay your hang-ups on me Vanessa You 're being very trippy
Who
Since I 've been unfrozen I 've had a rancid taste in my mouth Do you have a piece of gum
Out and about doing odds and sods
Yeah I ca n't believe Liberace was gay Women loved him man I did n't see that one coming
Hello luv
It was just a shag Vanessa You 're everything to me
Well they should filthy beggars they go from port to port Alotta meant nothing to me
Only sailors use condoms man
Of course I had my nine-millimeter automatic
Do n't be sorry You 're right to be suspicious I shagged her I shagged her rotten
Of course luv
Look at her hands baby Those are carpenter 's hands
She was very groovy She was so in love with your Dad If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did it was me But unfortunately for yours truly that train has sailed
I ca n't You 're drunk
Oh yes you are

Always wanting to have fun that 's you in a nutshell
Why
I have n't had fun like that since college
Sorry Move your hand to the left There you go Gorgeous
I could n't have another bite
You 're crazy The camera loves you Vanessa
No worries luv We 'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone
Well you know cows and shagging
Let me tell you a story There 's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below The young bull says 'hey why do n't we run down the hill and shag us a cow and the wise old bull replies 'no why do n't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows
He 's too well-protected right now
I never forget a pussy cat
Hello hello That 's Dr Evil 's cat
A limousine has just pulled up
Why
Do you want to talk to him
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch I get bad vibes from him man Listen we should go back to the room but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog
Oh I forgot to tell you they 're prescription X-ray glasses I have very bad astigmatism
I 'm going to use a cover name It 's important that it be a generic name so that we do n't draw attention to ourselves
I love Las Vegas man Oh I forgot my x-ray glasses
I 'm sure
Why What 's wrong with my teeth
Let me guess The floss is garotte wire the toothpaste contains plastic explosives and the toothbrush is the detonation device
You 've preserved my Jag Smashing
Listen Vanessa I 'm a swinger That 's what I do I swing
Do I make you horny Randy you know To you am I eros manifest
Do I make you horny
Brrrr She must be frigid There 's two things I know about life one Americans will never take to soccer Two Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag They 're shag-mad man Let me ask you a question Vanessa and be honest
We do n't use the term 'Negro anymore It 's considered offensive
A Chigro
Mr Powers please I know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand I would appreciate it if you 'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest
I 'm sorry
Excuse me
I beg your pardon
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects but I ended up specializing in foreign languages I wanted to travel see the world In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D in the Cultural Studies sector I thought I was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country It 's very boring My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi If I do well with this case I finally get promoted to field operative

EVIL Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure
EVIL Silence
EVIL And look what you 've done to Mr Bigglesworth
EVIL Ca n't you see I 'm only half a man Look at me I 'm a freak
FARBISSINA Please allow me to demonstrate
FARBISSINA They 're mutated sea bass
FARBISSINA Sea bass
FARBISSINA Well we experimented with lasers but you would be surprised at how heavy they are They actually outweighed the piranha themselves and the fish well they sank to the bottom and died
EVIL Right Mr Powers we 're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads
EVIL Yes what is it You 're interrupting my moment of triumph
EVIL Release the sharks All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads I figure every creature deserves a warm meal
FARBISSINA Thank you Herr Doctor
FARBISSINA These are the latest word in android replicant technology Lethal efficient brutal And no man can resist their charms Send in the soldiers
FARBISSINA Ya wohl I mean yes wohl Herr Doctor I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers Bring on the Fembots
FARBISSINA Yes Scott
FARBISSINA Well after a few years we got sort of impatient Dr Evil I want you to meet your son
FARBISSINA Remember when we froze your semen you said that if it looked like you were n't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever
EVIL The details of my life are quite inconsequential
EVIL Actually the boy 's quite astute I am trying to kill him My Evil Associates have cautioned against it so here he is unfortunately alive
EVIL No the boy 's right I really am evil
That was great Mr Keon Dave Thank you OK group we have two new member Say hello to Scott and his father Mr Ehville
EVIL I hate you I hate you I wish I was never artificially created in a lab
EVIL Dad we just made a breakthrough in group
EVIL What did you say
EVIL Do n't you want to see what Daddy does for a living
EVIL Come everyone let us repair to the main chamber Project Vulcan is about to begin Scott are you coming
EVIL I have a gun in my room Give me five seconds I 'll come back and blow their brains out
EVIL Are n't you going to watch them They 'll get away
EVIL One more peep out of you and you 're grounded Let 's begin
EVIL I have a better idea I 'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death
EVIL In due time
EVIL Scott I want you to meet Daddy 's nemesis Austin Powers
EVIL And that 's how you want to live your life is it
EVIL Fascinating What are your plans for this evening
EVIL Scott my boy come here How was your day
EVIL An evil petting zoo
EVIL An evil vet
EVIL But Scott who 's going to take over the world when I die
EVIL Hello Scott I 'm your father Dr Evil I have a son I have a son Everyone I have a son Someday Scott this will all be yours
EVIL Oh really One-hundred billion dollars OK make it happen Anything else
EVIL All right then FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
EVIL Right Oh hell let 's just do what we always do Let 's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage Gentlemen it 's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days Here 's the plan We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS
EVIL People have to tell me these things I 've been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here OK no problem Here 's my second plan Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser Using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth which we scientists call the Ozone Layer Slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer That is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
EVIL Gentlemen I have a plan It 's called blackmail The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
KENSINGTON I love you Vanessa
KENSINGTON No it 's been too long Best to leave things alone
You did n't answer my question Mum

Thank you Steed
Next assignment
So am I
To find out who killed my husband
Quite frankly it could have been you
A cover for us I 'm sorry
Peter Peel was a first class agent A senior operative X department Special operations He was engaged in top secret research Top priority Government approved
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss To us all
We want to help
Watch me
I resign
London The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence If you can control the weather you control the world
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes
Welcome to mobile H.Q Weather 's turning quite nasty Sir August was blown to smithereens Along with half of Banffshire The Ministry 's worried
Father will be your controller Steed here will show you the ropes
How curious
My number two Special assignments She 's
Hmmm
I 'll never marry you
What are my choices
How Wagnerian Do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own That would have amused Peter
One very small thing A diamond 'cyclone chip A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size If I possess that my powers would be unlimited My dear half-brother was developing it But he suspected sabotage He gave the chip to you 'Mrs Peel I want you But also your ring
Chaos Transport paralysis Crop failure Economic disaster Frostbite or sunburn on a massive scale You 've seen a few samples
Destruction of their local weather systems I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air
Entirely On the other hand Mad people get things done Let me show you
That 's better I say is n't this where you came in It 's impenetrable by the way
Right bridesmaid Now what have I left out Oh yes I know the ring
You know I believe she 's actually jealous
I 'm already married
Oh no Emma They 've only just begun
You disappoint me Emma Ca n't you guess For you It was all for you
Of course I planned that too
Spoil the majority shareholders In Wonderland Weather I planned everything even the Ministry recruiting you
For starters Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears as well
An unholy trinity
A slight miscalculation my face was burned beyond recognition Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy
You
Good luck Peter Emma
Ah sun tan lotion Any shops nearby
Our chaperon
Our little paradise just made for two
I do n't recall Siberia being this warm Steed
Have you any place in mind
Still a bit chilly
in a beautiful pea green boat
The plot Hello we must be going
Mrs Peel
Oh and by the way I think it 's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder
No bother Mother and Father think I 've joined you I might as well
Laying in supplies Mrs Peel weather may get very nasty and I 've no umbrella
I 'll be back
Bad news Father 's looking for you Where are those bloody ministers
They 're playing your song Mrs Peel

His name 's Jones 'Invisible Jones
Very well I have a friend who might be of assistance He 's at the Ministry We 'd better be careful
Quite Any childhood friends Enemies
Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All children 's things
Drat Someone wants to implicate you in this affair Mrs Peel Any idea who
You lied
As far as you trust me
No after you
Please do n't tell me it 's how you play the game
I 'm playing to win
I thought you played by the rules
You 're playing games
But you did suspect me
Keeping a stiff upper lip
It was n't me you have my word
And do you trust me
Yes
Because you always obey orders
I could save you the trouble
To kill me
You followed me
I expect that 's for you to know and me to find out
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists I 'm so sorry I struck you Mrs Peel Please forgive me I thought you were someone else
Mrs Peel
I expect we 'll have to gatecrash
Here 's the one that broke the camel 's back
You will let me know if you find that queen who 's in need of protection wo n't you
What Lady Disdain Are you yet breathing
Do you always drive this fast
Is that what you think
Not that I know of Explanation
Then a mad millionaire Head of a secret defense establishment A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather
Three agents killed by bad weather
That 's what we were working on
Exactly There 'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea Propane gas mostly In small quantities it captures chlorine Protects the ozone layer But it proved impractical Too bulky
The Prospero Project was started by my husband It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming In theory climate engineering is entirely feasible We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite A 'quick fix
Not quite This is my field
But
For you Mrs Peel
Common knowledge Mrs Peel
Well he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society
What on earth
Elementary Mrs Peel Trubshaw is n't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade
Colonel Crabtree International Satellite Systems Formerly of the Ministry
Either way may I ask why you dress in that fashion
I must say you look more your old self
An invitation To a 'formal picnic
Did he say who
Perhaps your memory plays tricks Mrs Peel
Frankly that 's how I remember it
Why should they think that
I might say the same
I was n't about to
Strange
Ah Brenda Mrs Peel
So I distract him while you snoop around How
Any other vices
June July August
An eccentric recluse
I meant me
After our fencing match I was rather hoping you would do the risking More tea
They call me in when they 've reached a dead end Freelance Like yourself
For a man in my position
As per mother 's instructions
That 's predictable When I find a queen in need of protection I 'll let you know
And I suppose you 're the knight
But why What 's the point
You know what I mean This car and you Nobody walks around like that Milk
That place is so absurd so out of date
You can but I wish you would n't
Steed we really must be
Oh absolutely but Trubshaw 's a man worth meeting No point setting out half shod
Yes indeed I need protection
I had a feeling you would Touche
My father always wanted a boy
Ah From Trubshaw 's My shoemaker
Showers followed by sunny periods
I did n't Mother did
Much better
I say this is all terribly formal Must I go an calling you Dr Peel
Not by me Play by the rules Doctor or the game is nothing
Dyed in the wool But I can admire someone who does n't play by the rules
Congratulations you 've penetrated a bastion of male privilege I guessed you were n't a stickler for Tradition doctor
Red herring would have been too obvious do n't you think
I should n't wonder Not a woman inside Boodles since
I was about to throw in the towel
Doctor Peel I presume
Decontamination
It 's Mother you have to convince He 's very agitated Wait here
Mobile HQ In a blue funk Ca n't take chances I 'm looking after things while he 's hiding out
You 're saying I have no choice
I 'm no spy where do I fit in
I 'm going to find out who killed my husband Will you take these documents to Steed
I shall need a small plane
Let me guess Wonderland Weather
and now
Well I ca n't possibly go like this
I fail to see
Getting to what
Are you suggesting that Dr Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together But that 's absurd
Who 's now vanished
Surveillance By whom
I know all this
JONES Half-brother to be precise
JONES Ah here we are Steed asked me to play a hunch Valentine Peel
I see
Well you found me Have a sniff of this why do n't you Careful the scent can be overpowering
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance you 're the mole who betrayed the Ministry
How did you guess
Dead I 'm afraid
Oh hello
We know one thing That suspect was not Mrs Peel
Global warming
I 'm warning you for the last time Steed whoever 's behind all this looks like Mrs Peel walks like Mrs Peel and kills like Mrs Peel
Where
You 're getting yourself into terrible trouble my son Weather 's turning very nasty and so am I
Mother and Father know best
Pity I was growing fond of Mrs Peel Unfortunately
You 're accusing Mrs Peel of killing her own husband
This man did you see him
Too late anyway Today 's escapade was only for starters This is no ordinary weather It 's manmade A kind of weather bomb
You
Still does n't Better safe than sorry She was in a dangerous game Steed High stakes She may prove to be a risk If she is there 's only one solution Termination
Something went wrong System malfunction Explosion Mrs Peel had a narrow escape Suspected sabotage Nothing proven File still open
Why
Insane
Amnesia
Think she really killed those agents
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming had they succeeded We need your expertise
You did n't come to talk about the weather surely
Brenda and I thought we 'd drop in
LADY This way
You do n't say Like looking for a needle in a
Both actually
She was
I feel sure of it
I think so thank you so much
Stay by the window By the window
Walk over to the window
Ask not for whom the telephone rings
Ugh
Come come You do n't really expect me to fall for
Are n't you forgetting about something
You said one shot
If you say so
That 's not playing by the rules
You wish
But did they teach you this
You 're better than I expected
The last one you 'll ever see

Nah he 's nothin It 's just sometimes sometimes you just got ta punch somebody out y'know
Hey
Brian See ya tonight
Never mind
What you did was drop the ball Probie Get that right
I told you to stay next to me
You split the team man And what was that crap with the standpipe You 'd think you and a hose were never introduced before
Y'know you got an awful short memory for direct orders I told you to stay beside me
I 'm in heaven Lt
I think you 're gon na find out Brian Do n't be late tomorrow
Yeah you know You know what it felt like
Thanks for the speakers
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie that I do n't think is going to make it
I know you cold Brian The scary thing is you probably could have faked it for awhile But you see in this job there 's no place to hide Is n't like selling log cabins You have a bad day here someone dies And that 's not fucking good enough Want another beer
What is it with you man huh How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up That scotch bullshit Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz You were bankrupt man
Why 'd you come here Brian
Yeah What about Laura
Millions Stephen And sexual favors
It worked when you were in sixth grade
In the Field Museum once
My God an actual operating 8-track
Been ripping off fire stations
I like what you 've done with the place
Not likely
So you 're going to fight fires now huh
Well look what we have here Nice costume Rent it
Who asked you
It 's a small town
I do n't have the slightest idea
I quit two days ago Brian
You 're right
I 'm sorry
What is
Y'know four years ago I was working in a bakery Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he did n't even know my name I run that office now Marty believed in me and I believe in him You want me to just throw that away
Do you know what you 're asking me to do
I do n't know anything about it
We still talking Look I 'm sorry about the other day
Hi
I work for the city
Leave Stephen out of this
Yeah And just how much of all this has been doing your job
You could have scared the son of a bitch off We may never bust him now All for a couple 's political points
Bullshit You knew what I told you was n't ready for the papers
You told Swayzak about our arson lead It 's all over the fucking news
Uh huh
I wanted to be a good one
When I came back I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman
See that trap door up there That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines It was pretty different then but kinda the same y'know
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city Lotta tradition locked up in here What do you think
Got anything to drink in there
In a dinosaur kinda way yeah
Jesus give him a break There is n't enough proof yet to go public Sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em and we 've maybe figured out why backdrafts but you ca n't rush this stuff Not 'till it 's locked
No he 's more of a dinosaur Guy 's not a dummy though He 's juggling alot of balls on this one
Okay
Well you did invite me here
Sorry Are you dating anyone
Hey So are you dating your boss or what
Yeah Well maybe I can fit it in
I do n't know I 'm kinda swamped here
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour
Hey
Arson
Okay I 'll arrange things with your assignment captain Marty 's a good man Brian
Hey sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss But I 'm not gon na be a poster boy for him I 'm trying to do something here There 's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them
So now you suddenly care about my future
C'mon Jennifer he 's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II
What was that Oh man you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard
All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
Yeah Swayzak Humanity 's last hope How can you work for that guy
Carrying Swayzak 's notebook
Oooh very sophisticated Having fun
With grenadine right
Well if nothing else it 's nice to know we can still be friends
Really No kidding
Yeah What have you been up to
So I see you 're still in the neighborhood
Uh I 've been sorta keeping a low profile the academy I graduated today
You look great
Jennifer
Not such a far walk after all is it Brian
After it took your dad the fire did it look at you Brian Did it talk to you
Good So our two heroes Adcox and McCaffrey they go back inside Only there 's another fire in there nobody sees And it took your dad did n't it Brian Did you see him burn
That 's a probie answer You 're smarter than that Brian
Very good Brian About your report here The way to a torch 's heart is through his tools That 's how you know him It 's the way he talks to the fire And to you if you listen
Right Light smoke low roll Couple a civilians hollering medium deal So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across what were you feeling Brian C'mon you promised Be honest Okay Guard
You got ta tell a story too Brian It 's fair C'mon do n't think too hard
Famous story even Straight burn Just an engine and truck first on scene What did you feel Brian when you first got there
I do n't have a story
Then who
Who 's doing this
So you came to me Well this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
Hey do I know you
See you Monday Sir
No it is n't out of your hands or you would n't even have met me If I push you have to let me back in Dead Hero Father Rule Sir
I need another one sir
If you remember sir my test scores were in the top
I want another shot Sir
If it was a joke sir you 'd be laughing
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city Is that how it 's going to read You 're the only one that knows
Your brother was a good man
So what do you want me to do
Just wondering
Did I say thanks
Did you pull me out
Well Brian I guess you can say it 's arson now
Then who wrote the report
I 've got three different drafts of the same report with different numbers that 're all over the place Looks like they were just making it up as they went along
This is the copy of Swayzak 's manning report that was released Everybody on this job knows it 's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers They 're all airtight
Nice bunch of guys
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants
Hey boss Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics which is a division of Windy City Ventures who 's partners are Alan Seagrave Donald Cosgrove and Jeffrey Holcomb
In a word Brian what is this job all about
What the hell are you doing here
Are you going public with this
That 's why the sealant on the doors So what have we got a torch with a conscience
What reason
But he killed these guys
What
I do n't work for them either
I do n't guess
Even if it was used to seal the air off that does n't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft A gun 's a helluva lot easier
Look it is n't proof okay Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove 's clothes
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen Would n't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire Problem 's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace unless you could find something that would eat its residue
During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher Trych breaks down and dissipates Will consume magnesium
Trychtichlorate is a binary structured
I just re-wrote your contract C'mere
No it could n't
Another backdraft
Do we have a language barrier here Glass
So you were happy here Warm and cozy and in no hurry Soot high clean unburned wall low indicates slow burn in thermal balance Find me some glass
Shhh
Where are you going
I think we should get something straight here I was assigned to this office by the city
Get used to me Inspector I 'm not going anywhere
Your Dennis kid I work alone
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile
Stephen 's not staying here now Brian He moved out last April
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident
Yeah you 'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid
I know I know Should a called I 've been really busy I joined the fire department
Four months
You look like Brian
Brian
Mr McCaffrey Keeping busy
Nice boat
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone Brian This could be a great opportunity to move beyond a fire engine
This one 's still with the fire department One of our best investigators Don Rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now We think he could use another pair of hands and you 're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
Brian let me come to the point I 'd like to offer you a job
That really was incredibly work you did You and your brother fighting fires together helluva image is n't it You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command
No need to be modest Brian
And I 'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman Brian
Swayzak 's not my boss
So you surviving without me
What
Y'know what Stephen said to me right when all the shit was coming hard You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you 're just gon na do this job or be great at it
Do you have to do that
Man Something sure put a crimp in his evening
Lots of fires They promote faster there Take a look at the last Lt 's list half the guys on it came from that battalion Got ta think about your future Timmy 115 's the station
Lucky guess And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments
Engine 115 right
What the hell are we waiting for
You know I 've got a perfect little spot here for Brian McCaffrey Fireman
And just this year Brian 's Sound Spectrum Your own company even Big step
Laguna Jamming Custom Surfboards
Uh huh And Pioneer 's Pride Mobile Log Cabins That was in your blood about six months was n't it
Really Well let 's have a look at what else was in your blood I always look forward to getting these they make such a nice collage for the bar Assistant Director Sales Aspen Snowmobile Tours
Well if it is n't the littlest McCaffrey Hey You break anything with that you buy it Sorry there must be something wrong with my eyes I keep thinking that 's a fire department uniform
Dad
Firehouse
Fireman shit
Your brother 's right If you do n't fasten these correctly they could open and you 'd get burned
Brian He 's not doing it right dad He never does it right
I 'll be there goddamn it
I 'll be there
I 'm busy goddamn it okay
I 'm busy
Call in another alarm We 're gon na need some back-up
I do n't want to confuse him Stephen
No that 's okay It 's just Sean
Stephen I can I talk to you a second
I It used to be when I was a kid what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs Life and death right and wrong When someone called the fire department we came Those guys do n't know how much I love them You do n't leave people hanging cause that 's what it 's all about It 's loyalty It 's 'till death do us part Is n't that what you heard It 's you go we go Cause without that it 's the end of families it 's the end of the fire department and when the fire department stops coming that 's the end of the fucking world I 'm sorry I came Helen it 's just it 's just there 's nobody I can talk to I miss you
I 'm sorry I could n't sleep
In a fire Never Look I 'm his brother I care about him y'know He was going to get himself killed Maybe not today maybe not in a year but it would 've happened And I could n't I just could n't
Hey I 'm the first one to admit when I 'm wrong
Y'know I treated him better than any other probie I ever had He probably hates my guts but I did the best thing for him I made him finally look in the mirror
He 's out
Coffee Nah I got ta go
You treated me like shit
Okay
He deserved it He was born deserving it
The great communicator
You remember
Stephen you got ta stop just showing up on the roof like this
He 's going to be a fireman
He 's got piano lessons
It 's not your roof anymore
Stephen what are you doing here
You ca n't talk about my brother like that
Uh Helen I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean
What the hell was it doing in the fire
Trychticholorate Alright it 's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents It 's pretty rare they stopped making it a couple a years ago
McCaffrey hold this for us
There 's something else kinda interesting
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers front doors It 's a combination of plumber 's putty and rayophene gum Burns almost completely away when you light it
And the world the whole world
And old ladies
Absolutely
Oh but it 's a good story Shadow You 're depriving our famous young friend here

Sister we all know what happened to you yesterday morning I expected that you would want to speak to me about it But you could have come to my office Your being here in the confessional implies that you Sister have done something wrong You have n't I assure you I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of curiosity or even pleasure you must n't

BYRD No matter how sexist or racist the material may be
BYRD Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN Let 's get right into it You have been called by some in the community a traitor a sellout an Uncle Tom Why does your show generate such feelings
I gots to go it 's my Moms
Hold on a sec I got a call
This has to be a big mistake
Yo DeLa I just got the news from the CNS brass They saw some clips from the pilot and they 're rushing it onto the air Yo we 're a midseason replacement ordered 12 shows We 're on in 3 weeks Didya hear what I just said Yo
Funnier to who and at who 's expense Dunwitty when Negroes start to run amok the boycotts when the demostrations commence I 'm giving them your home address Let 's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich Connecticut
I do n't give a good goddamn about Finland Norway Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from
I will not be held responsible for these revisions These changes are not the way I want to go This is an outrage This is a sham A violation
I 'm gon na leave you two creative geniuses alone
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO
That 's exactly my point Has he even directed actors before in anything
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video
Besides what does he know about Negroes
You 're telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself if not the pilot soon after
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm One misstep and we 're doing Amos and Andy Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain
We think so
What are you talkin 'bout It 's the move Stay wid me now We 're movin fast What does everybody else think about this
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry make us laugh make us look at our own humanity Make us feel good to be alive
In the projects Like Eddie Murphy 's The PJ 's
Do we have characters How about Honeycutt Snowflake Rastus Nigger Jim Sambo Jungle Bunny and how could we forget Aunt Jemima
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer He has educated feet
Negroes would be in an uproar
Protest finally forced Amos and Andy off the air Could stop us from ever getting on
Yep you guessed it
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire
Ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons Mantan and Sleep n Eat The Dusky Duo
Mantan and Sleep n Eat Two real coons I know we 're way out there but it 's satire
Are these our two stars sitting here in front of my nose Which one is Mantan again
Do n't worry about that that 's my department Now who do we cast We need a star Can Whoopi sing or dance
I 'm feelin dis
It is called MANTAN THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW
So let 's take this great form this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
I know you 're familiar with minstrel shows They came about at the turn of the 19th century It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface singing dancing telling jokes doing skits Dunwitty I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air Carol Burnett HeeHaw
I 've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right In my previous work it 's been all surface superficial I have never really dug deep Not anymore As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way Race has always been a hot button in this country 's history and it needs to be pushed harder If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony It 's about promoting racial healing
We 're all happy to be here and I 'm going to paint a picture for you
Delacroix I 'm glad you got your mind right
What is it you want from me Some plantation follies Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads You want me to go back to the ante bellum days
I 'm not sure if I can deliver what you want
I 'm an oreo a sell out Because I do n't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER A PJ 's or some as you might put it some nigger show I 'm a Tom I 'm whiter than white and you 're blacker than black Is that what you think
I 've never been given a fair shot
to white I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows
I 'm telling you it 's not
The material you 've been creating is too white bread White people with black faces The Huxtable 's Cosby revolutionary But that 's dead We ca n't go down that road again
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence
Forget it I believe you 're my most creative person I 've got on staff You 're hip You know what 's happening I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me
I 'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting
Do you know what C.P Time is
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you
I did n't find out about this very important staff meeting until
I 'm sorry I 'm late
Always keep 'em laughing
Baby you treat me so good Peerless you 're a good son I love you You never gave me no trouble
In life I'ma keep on living having a good drink got me a good young woman make a couple of dollars and make people laugh Have n't I always tol you all nigga 's are entertainers The question is what are you gon na do Peerless
Three nights Charleston South Carolina
The truth is never let them seeya sweat You do that that 's half the battle
Dem white boys giving you a hard time
Enough about me what 's happening with you
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
Daddy it ca n't be just because of that There had to be other factors
That 's what I 'm askin
How did you end up here
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped
My game is still strong No Viagra for me do n't need no chemicals Just my tonic
Good woman I trained her right
Pull up a chair Oh excuse me this is my lady DOT
Son Good to seeya Good to seeya
Go away unless you got my money
What do you want
He never showed it
Do n't tell him it 's from me or he wo n't take it
So what 's up with you
So he drank himself into a stuper
How long has my father been like this
Glad to meet you too You are all your father talks about
I told you but you would n't listen You never listened to me
Do n't make me have to use this
DeLa kiss my big black ass
Work related or otherwise
That was a mistake but I do n't regret it
This is crazy
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light This bucket of blood
DeLa you should try it sometime Come into the light
I ca n't lie to him If he asks me something I tell him what I think
Please do n't go there
He 's just playing big brother
You 're the one that put us together We 're friends
I do n't want to hear it
To me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior sub-human
It 's all good You got a hit show you 're gon na need a bank Plus I love these old black collectibles
I thought it was appropiate
This is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
No matter what you think you did come up with something unique Open it
A gift
A small victory is n't that small when you 've been use to losing
Everybody shut up
I 'm sorry I ca n't help it It 's too funny
C'mon You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family You gave your brother a shot That 's all anybody can ask for an opportunity a chance a shot He got his
The pleasure is mine
Just do n't lie to me
We both lied to him
Your life will never be the same
Just want to say good luck
You 've said that already
Which one is your brother
I 've never worked with any of you and you 've never worked with me so we 'll be starting from scratch I 'm a fair person a straight shooter and I do n't hold my tongue Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired
Good morning for those of you who do n't know me I 'm Pierre Delacroix I 'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins
I would n't bet against it My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
Even if money was n't an issue Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
It was the principle Dunwitty had to be enlightened I was making a point I take pride in my work Plus I already told you I was n't gon na walk away from my money
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
This is Cheeba
Manray better not be bleeding to death I need him After we 're done he can do whatever he wants to do until then he 's ours
And lose out on my money The only way I get paid is if I get fired And that 's what I intend to do
Good I 'm going to need your support
You getting cold feet
The point being that him the networks do n't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons
Dunwitty wants a Coon show And that 's what I 'm going to give him it 's going to be so racist so negative he wo n't have the balls to put it on the air Hence I 'll prove my point
Not yet but this thing will never get made
Manray was under our nose the whole time
How can this be You and me at the same time the exact same thought It 's scary
How did you know
Manray
What good are you if you do n't tell me stuff like this
Why did n't you tell me about this staff meeting
I 've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin 's LAUGH-IN
This thing was rigged the deck was stacked the fix was in Could Don King be near Good thing Sloan had my back She 's my rock This was going to be a whole lot of work
I perfectly understand where you 're coming from As a minority I can relate to your struggle also But I think you should give us all a chance We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you Please do n't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
He I 'm Mona
Kook and the Gang it 's Manray Let 's do the taping You go back to your dressing room get dressed and blacken up
Mantan we got a show to tape
I do n't believe it
Sloan is the hardest working person I 've ever met
What you did is dead wrong
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up
You 've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost Do n't you know you should never let them see you sweat Y'knowwhatI'msayin
You getting scared because some people do n't like what you are doing
What are you A man or a mouse Are you a punk Punking out on me
Hope the same thing does n't happen to me That 's some big shoes to fill
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal Besides there is no such thing as bad publicity
This is nothing It will blow over by tomorrow
So they can be on TV
Not nervous Relaxed
You feel good not nervous
Can I kiss you too
Now I 'm privileged Why Because I did n't grow up on food stamps and welfare Because I did n't call home a cardboard box No I never ever went to bed hungry and I 'm proud of it too Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
I did n't mean it to sound like that
I 'm happy for all of us It 's just we have a great responsibility now The pressure is on
I wo n't forget When are you coming up here to see your mother
You know how your Daddy is
No
Of course I 'm happy for you You 've worked very hard for your success
I 'm doing okay Been reading about your show it 's all over everywhere I watched it 's all over everywhere I watched it once I thought you said there would be no buffoonery
C'mon Mommy Daddy has n't been impressed with anything I 've ever done From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present
It 's gon na be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
I do n't even know why you 're still concerned over him Daddy 's not with you
I ca n't go all the way down south
Where is he
He said that
I 'll be right over
I will And good luck with your show I hope it 's a huge success You 've worked very hard You deserve it
Peerless I did n't raise a buffoon We have enough of those on television already
I guess he 's still on the road What kind of show is this Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons
Son Peerless is your name Now you might be one of these Hollywood types change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate
If at first it 's not what you want just work that much harder Peerless
That 's wonderful Is n't that what you always wanted a show of your own
How 's the food
C'mon Mommy do n't start with that I 'm an ungrateful son stuff
It looks delicious
Thank you very much I always try my best
This is a travesty A debacle
This is a TV show not a music video
How did you get this gig
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN there were NEGROES I 'M A NEGRO
Did you just ask me what 's a Negro I 'M A NEGRO
What 's a Negro
You know Finlandia vodka Yes
Helsinki which is the capital of Finland
I just turned twenty
This show was created conceived by you a non-threatening African American male Voila End of argument It ca n't be racist because you 're black
Thank you And always smile
We all stick to this it 's smooth sailing
The best defense is offense
First I would like to say I love the show It 's very courageous My parents marched in Selma Alabama with Dr King
I envy you That 's the way I want to feel about my work
Why do you say that You 've never seen me
If that was suppose to be a compliment I thank you
No we 're not knocking boots I got this internship while I still was at NYU DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant
What do you mean
A little I just graduated from NYU film school Cinema studies
I wish I had your natural talent God only makes that visit once in a while
You 've never had any formal training either
SMILEY I admit that 's a very hard thing to do Quickly let 's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors DA BOMB 125 PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR IT MAKES YOU WAN NA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER 125 AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS

SMILEY Is it inevitable that the game plays you
SMILEY Money and nothing else
SMILEY Let 's jump right into it Your show has sparked a world of controversy provoked a tone of dialogue How do you see all of this
SMILEY Before we begin I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview You could have chosen Mike Wallace Barbara Walters Jane Pauley whatnot but you 're here

Go to your windows and yell out scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted bruised and battered bodies I 'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I 'M NOT GON NA TAKE IT ANYMORE
Cousins I want all of you to go to your windows Go to your windows and yell Yell I 'm tired of the drugs the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents I 'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks I 'm tired you 're tired we 're all tired of these so-called bible thumping God fearing whore mongling Professional athletes Are n't you tired of these basketball-dunking football-running hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho 's I know I am and so is Sleep N Eat
Well thank you Mistuh Sleep N Eat
No mo city slickers Ahh ca n't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton
To come back to our roots
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown Harlem
This is my best friend Sleep N Eat
You can go now
Why do n't you answer
Forget about me are you a puppet for DeLa
That 's ancient history That has nothing to do with you and I
We did it one time only once It had nothing to do with the job it was stupid Everything I 've got I 've earned
Say what Manray
Just ask me what you want to know
And what
After my internship expired Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant
Worked my black ass off first as an intern then worked my way up to this position
You look beautiful like that
Y'know what
My people love me
For what He left Not me
We can look out for ourselves
Why all of a sudden are you flippin on me This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go Do n't even try to play it like you ai n't a part of all this You down with Delacroix
Maybe I need to do a lot of things
Never read a book in my whole life
No before my time
Gots no intention of ending up broke
Just a little something somethin
Sloan I got it like 'dat
Are you trying to rap to me
I 'm an asthmatic Been one all my life Ca n't go anywhere without an inhaler
What do you want to know
Enough
Well homeboy looks like he 's at a funeral
Not at all sir I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again
That is none of your business
Good morning
Do n't bully Mr Best Here are the pistols God bless you my boy and when I count three fire
There 's nothing else for it Take your ground Grogan twelve paces I suppose
BEST I 'm not afraid of highwaymen My man is armed and so am I
If you 're insulted and not satisfied remember there 's two of us Best
BEST I never was more in earnest
BEST It 's not the English way for ladies to have two lovers and so Mr Dugan I 'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and I resign all claims to this young lady If she has a fancy for school-boys let her take 'em sir
BEST I 'll tell you what it is Mr Dugan I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways I ai n't used to 'em sir
GALGENSTEIN Oh That will be sent after him I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say and at noon after parade shall be at the inn You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the Chevalier 's rooms until my arrival We must force that box You are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago
GALGENSTEIN You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
GALGENSTEIN Has he sent the challenge yet
GALGENSTEIN What are the Chevalier 's intentions
Only a very little as soldiers do
GALGENSTEIN There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast and wears the red riband and star of the pope 's order of the Spur He is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
GALGENSTEIN Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas
How do you do sir
Neither
Sir I 'm a British officer
Upon my word sir I think you have acted very coolly
Where 's the beauty you promised me
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard
GALGENSTEIN Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe
GALGENSTEIN This is a very good inn Shall we stop for dinner
O'Grady
My companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about England which I answered as best I might But this best I am bound to say was bad enough I knew nothing about England and I invented a thousand stories which I told him described the king and the ministers to him said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him
The coward
Mrs John Best Was there another Mr John Best
Good heavens Whatever Has she died of grief
Is Miss Dugan well
GROGAN We must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to Brown Bess
GROGAN I had news of you in Dublin Faith you 've begun early like your father 's son but I think you could not do better than as you have done But why did you not write home to your poor mother She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin
A man of honor dies but never apologizes I 'll see the captain hanged before I apologize
GROGAN It must have been some other gate
GROGAN But swords are today impossible Captain Best is is lame He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
GROGAN Oh it 's with pistols we fight You are no match for Best with the sword
I am Harry James son and will act as becomes my name and quality
It was with this sword that my late father Harry James God rest his soul met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone the Hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck He was quite in the wrong having insulted Lady Fuddelstone when in liquor at the Brentford Assembly But like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
GROGAN Your cousins go out with him
GROGAN The meeting is arranged Captain Best is waiting for you now
GROGAN In faith I believe you are not for a lad I never saw more game in my life Give me a kiss my dear boy You 're after my own soul As long as Jack Grogan lives you shall never want a friend or a second
GROGAN Well if it must be it must For a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw No officer bearing His Majesty 's commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it fight you must and Best is a huge strong fellow
GROGAN And this is the return you make for his kindness Did n't he harbor you in his house when your father died and has n't he given you and your mother rent-free your fine house of Jamesville yonder
GROGAN A pretty day 's work of it you have made Master Roderick Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so He takes a girl without a penny a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father
Dorothy might love me or not as she likes but Best will have to fight me before he marries her
GROGAN This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
Repeat the words again and I run you through the body
Sirrah Sirrah I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland
O'REILLY I have heard of them
O'REILLY Oh I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife 's dear father Colonel Granby Somerset
O'REILLY Mr O'Higgins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin Mister O'Higgins I wonder if I know your good father
O'REILLY Mr O'Higgins I can not say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife
Your Grace if I am so tame as to take this then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which I have honorably won
I deny your Grace 's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
OFFICER The gentleman has nothing contraband
OFFICER As you please
OFFICER Your honor must lower his voice
OFFICER I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
OFFICER You are going to drive to the frontier
OFFICER I will let down the steps for your honor
Perfectly certain because I shall make him tremble
I risk nothing for I am certain to kill him
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask
Gentlemen I wish you a good day Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden
Make your mind easy you shall not be left behind I warrant you Do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in Berlin The dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
I have faced that problem before
Have no fear It will come out well for me
We will practice in the mornings my boy and I 'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing
The cards are now my only livelihood Sometimes I am in luck and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see It 's property look you and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me When the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste Do you understand the cards
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood
Who else can give me information about you
For whom else have you worked
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi
You are the young man who M de Seebach recommended
That is a trifle strong
On the instant Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
Very well Now that I know it I will no longer love her
Certainly monseigneur does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love
Old fool
Roderick you know well enough that I have never loved but you Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy Ever so angry but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it No I loved you too much and too fondly I have always loved you From the first moment I saw you I saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but I could not help loving you I married you though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty What sacrifice do you want from me I am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out Oh my God Is it true I am not dreaming
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy
O my dearest love Enough I beg you Stop believing in your experience You have never known love My very soul is leaving me Catch it on your lips and give me yours
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty
Let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew
I know better than you do Love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away
Will we always leave it at this
Poor man And for that reason you want to begin where people end
You will do as you please It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other Do you not agree
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me If I do not know it I am innocent
To love you until death To subscribe to all your commands
It is my only object
By loving you with no hope of possessing you
I believe you and I see I must hasten to leave for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men
I agree but God put us on earth to take that risk
That is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
It is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
Then you have never loved Your heart is empty
What You have not met a man worthy of your attention
Have you not a man whom you value
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
But for a time a passing fancy
Have you had one
Indeed Miss Dorothy I intend to have his blood as sure as my name 's Roderick
Jump twenty feet You would n't dare to do any such thing on Daisy There 's the captain 's horse Black George I 've heard say that Captain Bes
What with me on the pillion Would you kill poor me
Suppose now Roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side
If ever I meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two I 'll fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is
But you refused me Dorothy
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best and then stroll out with him into the garden
I hate Miss Clancy you know I do And I only danced with her because because the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night
Why are you shaking
I feel the ribbon
Agreed
All right five hundred guineas
It is entirely up to you I want the best
Yes for I wish to entertain splendidly
As much as possible
WEST Well Mr Cosgrove I 'll answer you point by point The King is exceedingly averse to make peers as you know Your claim as you call them have been laid before him and His Majesty 's gracious reply was that you were the most impudent man in his dominions and merited a halter rather than a coronet As for withdrawing your support from us you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please And now as I have a great deal of occupation perhaps you will do me the favor to retire or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you
WEST Have you done Mr Cosgrove
By name only
And to be sure I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister Lord West whose acquaintance I made as I had so many others at the gaming table
GALGENSTEIN Then this must be done tomorrow
GALGENSTEIN The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country
GALGENSTEIN A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible
In so far as I can tell these things no I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly
Yes Minister I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein
O'REILLY You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
O'REILLY That 's very kind of you Mr O'Higgins
O'Higgins Mohawk O'Higgins
I am riding to Dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap
O'REILLY Everything my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuff-boxes watches And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
O'REILLY Oh I am grateful to you sir I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin My chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship 's assurances they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth in their presence at their counting-house in Birchin Lane London I requested they come here and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London but they declined saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate as they were aware of how other respectable parties such as Messrs Sharp and Salomon had been treated here
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation They were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital
May I be quite frank with you
There are a few other points we should discuss The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill in giving her signature
Considering your financial circumstances Mr Cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity But obviously if you would reject this offer I shall keep trying to find a better one
I have good news for you Mr Cosgrove The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick in the city of London are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds pledged against your interest in the Edric mines They will redeem the encumbrances against the property which amount to some 10,000 pounds and take a twenty year working lease on the mines They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income which they will apply to the loan as it comes in and they will make a charge of 18 per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance
Yes he 's fine
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan 's farm to see him
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you 've already bought my horse and that it 's at Doolan 's farm where Mick the groom is breaking it in Is that true papa
Papa
Good night papa
But I will have it on my birthday wo n't I
Did you buy the horse papa
Sir let those laugh that win
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight
Well if my intentions are what you think they are if I do wish to step into your shoes what then I have no other intentions than you had yourself Lady Cosgrove 's wealth may be great but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily Her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her and if I win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me
Faith sir if I want to learn good principles it 's surely better I should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you
I think Sir William Cosgrove you have had too much drink Your chaplin Mr Hunt has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter of which she is a considerable expert
I beg your pardon
Sir William Cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches He was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live I do n't know how many years If Cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady But my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account
The milkmaid 's daughter
Would you have me spend my life all alone
WILLIAM Hang it Mr Roderick James you have no more manners than a barber and I think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck and I like you sir because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own
Tender Hegenheim
Will he wish to know the details of this night
If his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
And he does n't care about me
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
Black-eyed Sczortarska
Old friend Have n't talked to him in 911 Can I use your phone
Bill Styles
Hurricane kept you up too
You know the law no liquor before noon Could lose my license
It 's ten thirty in the morning
You know that was like a quadruple negative
None of that matters now We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them You 're either with us or against us which is it
Maybe he 's dead too Maybe you killed them both Mueller
Maybe he 'll be there Either way we have to go
It was the grenade you fucking idiot Look at him
Fine
Whoever it is is n't shooting at us
Fuck what the fuck is going on
I thought I was gon na have an attack Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou Childs could tell I was n't right
I 'm I 'm sorry
Shut up Mueller
HEY
I do n't know
We got I do n't know we got separated
You killed him you fucking faggot
Hey I Holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
This is n't our area Whose area is this
You too
Yeah right
Holy fuck Holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
What about you wandering around alone At least we have an alibi
We finished the course and came here then heard an explosion Where 's Pike
Washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
You wo n't find them Wo n't find West either He 's too good
I guess Nunez was n't dead after all He came after us with a vengeance You know the rest
Do what
Jesus
We 've found all of them
We do n't need the tapes
We 're not finished yet
Raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony Otherwise this is just another story
You saved Kendall 's life
You shot Childs and Nunez
And he 'd been shot
You saw West 's body
Yeah we know Pike did
So Childs made some side money so what People are dead Ray and the only one we have to blame is you
Fuck you 're serious Raymond you got exactly zero truck with us right now we 'd take the word of a crackhead over yours so if you 've got something to say say it
Well why did n't you say so We 'll just drop all your charges then
That 'd be my reaction too
Hey Ray Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall seems you killed three people
This is one of those interrogation tricks is n't it You do n't give me a cigarette till I tell you more
Yeah And that 's all I 'm saying
Tell me about them
Okay but I would like to know about the other cadets What they were like nice guys
Why 'd you ask for a cop Ray
Right Now I 'm gon na go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more okay
There 's no need
You did Basic here
I do n't know I like the Army
I just do n't like it
It 's too slow
I asked for a policeman
Just a guess Maybe they 're not where they 're supposed to be Maybe somebody moved them Habeas Corpus no bodies no crime and Nunez still plays as self defense Face it detectives you have nothing
Ohhhh I do n't think so
We can prove that you 're not Ray Dunbar Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself
Ca n't do that now though can you
Do n't know on a map West told us it was there we just found it Maybe the hurricane took it away
Would you have believed me
Yeah
Back up
What about the phosphorous grenade
Where
What business
He said he worked there
Epilepsy
There were six of us
That first night with Pike I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you
What the fuck is going on
Sir yes sir
Sir yes sir
Sir Dunbar sir
I
So did we Why did n't you come
West he 's dead
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one
Shut up Let me see your grenades
Oh bullshit he 's a fucking convict You know how much he hated West
Put it down
We wait and I 'm a dead man I got a black face a criminal record and over a hundred other cadets who 'll testify how much I hated West my court martial will take six minutes It 's either me or them Ray and you got ta decide right now
There 's no time to think Ray we got ta get out of here You untie me we grab the guns get Kendall and Nunez and make a run for it
What do n't you know
Mueller and Childs One of them must 've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper
Way I figure it West must have found out about their little business and was gon na bust them so they decided to get rid of him first
His chest was hamburger
Full clip to the body
That still does n't mean you did n't kill him
Why why did n't you tell me
You 're lying
Just look Little pocket
Look in my pack
Enough to go to prison Childs PX scam Mueller was in on it
Who you gon na trust Ray Him or your friend
We 're sweeping our area and suddenly he 's gone Couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away
Mueller
Ray this is my life here I ai n't gon na pretend I 'm not happy West is gone but you know I could n't have done this It 's not in me
You 're the only one missing a grenade
You hated West more than any of us
Yeah
Do I
Why
Roberto what the fuck
Where have you been Jay
What do you mean West 's
Whose blood is that Jay
MAYBE WHAT
Where are they
You lied to us Levi you 're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
I did n't
Because I was standing next to him
Because of what I saw Who really killed West
I did n't do anything
I was just thinking of what 's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
Then we 'll leave it up to the courts His word against mine What does his father do again Steelworker Does n't matter I 'm sure justice will be served In any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son He 's quite protective
Sorry to disappoint I 'm on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind You 're right it was Nunez Any more questions
I believe your next line is What are you trying to hide
No I said Dunbar
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds The guns went off I ran in Childs shot me Pike and Mueller were dead and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun
There 's that word again As I told you I was n't in the room when everyone started shooting
My heart weeps
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who 's been shot
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar
Somebody emptied a full clip into him
Okay I think that 's it He rises and walks to the door
Why did he come back for you
He admitted it
But you did n't
Then who did
What happened to degrees
Levi I do n't know if you 're familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one
I think you just blew Do n't Ask Do n't Tell out of the fucking water
Senator Daddy must be thrilled
My my my how did things turn so hostile so quickly If I did n't know better I 'd say you two were out to get me
I 've done nothing wrong I 'm the victim here
That 's it You 're that policeman with friends in low places Tell me how 's Guissepe Torres doing these days Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer
You I 've seen you around the Base But you You 're not Army are you
For the last time I have no idea what you 're talking about
You 're crazy
Not for long
No You will stand there and you will listen What happened to you Bill You were the one who joined up to do good in the world You were the one who believed in it
You poisoned him Bill You heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like Pike
Toxicology report came back Kendall 's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe you 've heard of it It 's for asthmatics If an epileptic takes enough it kills them I checked with the nurses at the hospital you 're the only other person who visited Kendall
What I ca n't understand is why you signed these If you 'd just let West take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too
Or what You 've gone round the bend
I 'm not going to cover for you Bill Not for this
If you let him testify then it would have all come out West was supposed to take care of it out there shut Nunez up and then disappear But it got messy and people got killed So you called your old pal Tom Hardy figuring if worse came to worse he 'd cover for you
It was so good I actually forgot you 're one of the bigger dogs now The Base Commander The one in control You could n't let him testify could you
You 're a good soldier Bill
I 'm sorry Bill
They 're taking your command are n't they
You think you could explain all this to me
That 's horseshit and you know it
Does Osborne agree
Was dead right You think Dunbar 's on the level
I 'm talking about West We had him Bill we were there You 're the fucking Base Commander you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has
You want a confession Why do n't you confess Bill people are dead and you do n't give a shit about it Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault
Home I 'm done
JAG gets here in three hours Try for the confession
Not for me
Nevertheless
Without the body we have no physical proof We need a confession
Habeas Corpus you have to have a body to have a crime
We 've already been over the terrain twice Nothing
Who killed Pike
He can wait Kendall 's out of surgery
I 'm not gon na let that happen
And I 'm the closest thing to it right
Which gives us about five hours Why 'd you call me
I 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one
And the problem is you only got three
Well he 's a good soldier
It 's not West is it Tell me it 's not West
And here you are going out of house How 's that make you feel Jules
Tell me what I can do
That bad
Been better I read about what 's been happening with you I should have called
Yeah But he was a lot of other things too Thanks
In case you need me to testify about the shooting They 'll clear you
Yeah
A word of advice about women that first hour or so after they kill their boss Probably not the best time to hit on them
Nah
Go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
What are you doing out here
Do I have a choice in this
West
Really
There are degrees of truth officer Always degrees
Tough
This is the perfect time You know what makes a good detective The number of confessions they get You 're a good detective Osborne So now you get mine
Seven guys What was it you said You were just starting to believe I was n't the guy people said
Seven
No death certificates No crime
WHERE 'S WEST 'S BODY
We can tie you to the chair if it 'll work better for you
Hardy what are you doing
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down
Four
No
We were close to something with Kendall
For what
You know you never told me why you left the army
Think it 'll work
So what now
Yeah
You mean the falsely accused
You wanted to get the truth
You could n't have known
See I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall 's gay son went nuts on a training mission
Good idea
Positive Hardy they planned this
What Kendall said the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around That 's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter
They got their stories straight
Let 's go talk to Bill
That bugs you too
And all hell breaks loose A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz bang zoom happy ending
Kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin
And if they 're asked that 's what they 'll tell the world
Exactly someone who 's not involved who 's word ca n't be questioned You only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes they 've totally bought into your version of events
And they 're smart about it They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness
What happened next
Dunbar He said he did n't shoot West West was n't shot Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body
I did n't shoot West
Why do you care
Oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit This is n't my great second chance Osborne Everyone thinks I 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that Nobody will ever know what happens here
Phenomenal at taking bribes right
West was a monster Fifteen years ago I was here I was Section Eight I was Pike Fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did stripping Pike down making him stand outside all night He did that every year he did that to me Fifteen years ago I wanted him dead and now I 'm supposed to care that somebody offed him Sorry no can do I tried
Watch me
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what He deserved it There 's your confession
I do n't know
Well I 'm sure if he 'd known this was all going to happen he 'd have tried harder to witness it for you
Everyone 's capable of murder Osborne
That means under a year Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic There are no conspiracies no grand mysteries and no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it does n't always make sense but it 's always neat Dunbar 's our guy
Too neat How long have you been an investigator
But we have to question him Thought you did n't have cigarettes
That was kid gloves
Remember he 's the son of a Senator so go easy Kid gloves
Being back here Gives me the willies
What point
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there What do you think of Dunbar
So noted
I plan to grow on you
The very same
Yeah That 's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed Truth is I do n't know The whole honor and duty thing Make a difference in the world crap like that Did n't really work out
I lost a bet
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
Microrecorder for Kendall did n't have time to wire his room Now tell me why you joined the army or I 'll jab this pen through your neck
Best time for banal chit-chat
You 're right We should sit in silence
Oh I 'm sorry I did n't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good Everyone knows good cop bad cop by admitting it I appeared trustworthy
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars
See Ray this is what we call good cop bad cop She shouts I stand up for you you 're grateful a bond of trust is established
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes
Something like that
Thank you At some point in there I 'm gon na rub my nose When I do go at him with everything you got
That is the most unprofessional
Excuse me
Why
Yes
Kendall Junior is still in surgery so he wo n't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour the cadet we 're talking to first is Dunbar
Senator Jonathan Kendall of Ohio
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe so all we have are their dogtags Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall
Subtlety really is n't one of you finer points is it Osborne
It was for suspicion of bribery it 's really all in the wording
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff I owe him
Got ta be honest I love what you 've done with the place
Sergeant West 's served for twenty three years He 's the public face of the modern Army
He was our Drill here Man 's older than sand
Ah Christ
Hostile and uncooperative
Pike please
I do n't think I want to hear this
How
What are you talking about
To start a fire goddammit What about him huh Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts brought an extra one in his pack Y'ever think of that Go ahead cut him loose First chance he gets he 'll waste the rest of us that 's how they work
I was freezing from the hurricane
Oh you remember now
Yeah and he does n't know when
You better watch it faggot I 'm not sure you and Childs did n't do him
They found him Poor fucker was practically blown in half
We should tell him we 're not going
You ever been in a hurricane Mueller
Maybe we should n't go
What happened with Nunez
I scared Dunbar into silence He 's been trying to cover for me the whole time We got here you came to see me I did n't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret
Childs
We did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone It was because I threatened him
Dunbar 's telling the truth
Wait
It will and you know why Because you 're not a person anymore you 're a cadet in the United States Army you have no identity no Miranda warning and no rights So I 'm gon na throw you to the wolves and unlike you I 'm gon na get away with it because you 're pissing me off
What
You ca n't threaten me
Then he 's mistaken You know I really do n't think my father would approve of this line of questioning
No but it got you interested did n't it Got you to dig Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they did n't belong
Not much time to solve the crime Tell me detective how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it
Running out of time are we Tick tock tick-tock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
Pike never confessed
But you did n't see it right
Nunez was chasing Dunbar
No one else heard it
He said what
He could n't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
We just want
Tell him to shut up
Until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West 's body
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard
Cadet Michael Mueller I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West
Goddammit Ray we got ta get out of here
I used it to start the fire
We all know what you did Pike I do n't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here but
This place is going Mueller We got ta move
Thank God
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first
What the fuck happened to you
Hurricane 's due after midnight and we 're still going out
So
No no that was Cadet Dunbar
Terrible tragedy One of those Section Eight boys worked in here Pike Heard he got out okay
Sign here and here Hey ai n't you the folks workin on that whole hulabaloo from last night
You never told me why you got kicked out of
What happens to Dunbar now
We know
He tried to burn Dunbar to us You do n't do that if you 're not involved
It 's too neat
No
I called the JAG Corps the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C on a transport leaving here at 1700
Then it 's unofficial
He 's former Army and the best I 've ever seen in a room Besides he knows the territory we did Basic together here You 've had three hours with Dunbar and have n't gotten a peep we need to take a different tack
He asked to see a policeman we 're getting him a policeman
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find Each area has twenty targets first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins Teams are as follows Dunbar and Nunez Pike and Mueller Kendall and Childs
Some of you may have heard there 's a hurricane coming American soldiers do not wait for good weather they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh feel free to lay down and die you get me

BENNETT Not that one The real story Did he ever tell you that
BENNETT Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born
How would you describe him

Oh so this is a tall tale
I never knew
Please
Can I take your picture
They were squeezing the cheese Clanking the bottles Licking the popsicle
He was buttering her rolls Pumping her churn Splashing milk in her box
No I understand
Terrible for her but think about me young boy with that kind of power Was n't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said Your Grampa is going to die Well I ran right back to my parents My father said no Gramps is fine but I could see there was trepidation And true enough that next morning my Grampa was dead
Means when you dream about something that 's going to happen Like one night I had a dream where this crow came and told me Your Aunt is going to die I was so scared I woke up my parents They told me it was just a dream to go back to bed But the next morning my Aunt Stacy was dead
I was dreaming
You 're lucky to get four words out of them in English But if you were to walk through the jungle you 'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French Those parrots talk about everything politics movies fashion everything but religion

Beats me
Okay
I love every square inch of it But I can feel the edges closing in on me A man 's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this So what do you say Join me

Would n't lie to you And they 've got all-you-can-eat buffets You can eat a lot ca n't you
Hardly two stories in the whole place Now I 've heard in real cities they 've got buildings so tall you ca n't even see the tops of 'em
You become what you always were A very big fish And that 's the way it happens
It 's unbelievable
You say
Somehow you 're better Different You 're getting ready to go And I say

You think I 'm fake
I 've told you a thousand facts That 's all I do Will I tell stories
What you 're seeing down to my nose My chin
Then you should n't have started with a question Because people want to answer questions You should have started with The thing about icebergs is

Can we talk
Dad
I think someone has n't

I will
I 'd just like to know the true versions of things Events Stories You
Dad I 'm hoping we can talk about some things while I 'm here
There 's a lot you do n't know about me
True story
You owe me three-fifty
And every day I gave him a quarter Every day Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks And when I went back there you know what he said
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office
So how does it happen
No she was old and probably senile Maybe schizophrenic
The Old Lady by the swamp
Really
You learned from the best
No but I hear it 's terrible Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine
Having a kid changes everything I mean there 's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
You are in for a surprise
Your mom says I ca n't tell you that one anymore You get nightmares
No Dad they do n't I do not like the story Not anymore not after a thousand times I know all the punchlines Dad I can tell them as well as you can For one night one night in your entire life the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom It revolves around me and my wife How can you not understand that
Friend of yours Did you help him out of a bind
I am a footnote in that story I am the context for your great adventure Which never happened Incidentally You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born
Make him stop
I see We need to get you one of those plant misters We can spray you like a fern
Go out with me
I have the rest of my life to find out
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me
They 're your favorite flower
But you 're wrong I do know you at least by reputation Edward Bloom from Ashton See I 'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton Don Price He was a few years older than you
Do n't need to apologize to me I mean I 'm the luckiest person you 're going to find today
WINSLOW Edward it 's got your deposit slip on it
WINSLOW This is it The whole vault
So what are you up to now
WINSLOW I want you to know when you left Spectre it opened my eyes There was a whole life out there that I was not living So I travelled I saw France and Africa half of South America Every day a new adventure that 's my motto
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas
You 're a poet You oughta be able to And maybe if you 'd seen more you could
Norther do you ever regret not making it to Paris
WINSLOW There 's a lot of expectation I do n't want to disappoint my fans
WINSLOW I 've been working on this poem for 12 years
Wait I need those
You did n't become crazy
Logically you could n't be the Witch because she was old back when he was young
Look I do n't know how much you want to know about any of this You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it Especially this late in the game
Can I ask you a question Why did you come here today If you found this deed why did n't you just ask Eddie
Wow Wow you just said it I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour
This was on his sales route so he was through here all the time Everyone in town knew him
I am And you 're Will I 've seen your picture that 's how I recognize you I almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward Like this
I was n't expecting you
Oh Oh
I do
I know It was the same when I was carrying Will Like clockwork
I need to lie down for a bit
I 'll help you
We 'll have to pick up a copy
Down the hall on the right The door sticks You have to really pull it
Thank you I 'll bet you need to
Your father had a stroke He 's upstairs with your mom and Dr Bennett
I am always on your side And I think you should talk to him
You 're not
What is true I 've never heard my father say a single true thing
You have to understand When I was growing up he was gone more than he was here And I started thinking maybe he has a second life somewhere else With another house another family He leaves us he goes to them Or maybe there is no family Maybe he never wanted a family But whatever it is maybe he likes that second life better And the reason he tells all those stories is because he ca n't stand this boring place
Everyone loves my father He 's a very likeable guy
Mmm what I know better than to argue romance with a French woman
Mmm
That 's because most of it never happened
They met at Auburn
Did you
I 'm going with you
I 'm going with you
You need to go
It 's bad
Mom do you want some time with Dad
I 'll stay Why do n't you go home with Josephine and I 'll stay tonight
Heavens no We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place
I suppose your grandmother 's house when she passed on But we sold that right away Your cousin Shirley bought it
Yes
He just fell asleep Josephine 's with him
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
Do you know who that is
Was she one of your teachers
Before I forget your father has papers in the basement I 'd like you to go through I would n't know what 's important
But I understand you Mom I always have
True But I 've known him my whole life and I do n't feel like I know him at all Or ever will
Josephine and I have a lot in common
Yes But that 's a different
Yes Will I do And do n't presume things you do n't know
Yes
Of course
Really That 's wonderful
You do n't talk about those things Not yet
He 's impossible He wo n't eat And because he wo n't eat he gets weaker And because he 's weaker he does n't want to eat
He 's up with your father
You did n't need to do that You just did n't
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport

She 's alive She is not dead
I do n't know why I said it I 'm sorry

She 's dead
It 's none of your business She did n't have small eyes
What
Not really Maybe a little
No

Get out
You do n't understand you either
So what did you want I think we understand each other no
You did n't mind too much
You
Oh I think you will recover okay I think you got what you paid for
So now you hate all women
Why
There 's nothing wrong in liking sex John
Sometimes neither
Sometimes
Listen I did n't go rooting around in your private stuff
So What then You just detach sex from everything
And that would be Morals That would be one 's own moral sense of decency
And It 's wrong
Okay Let 's Okay Okay You have had sex with people you do n't like have n't you For money To make money
So What 's it like having to fuck men you hate
Okay we wo n't talk about it
You do n't want to talk about it
Why not
No But you tend to tie them up
He left me my passport and ticket It 's pretty clear he wants to see me again
He will come back
But you know so what
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
Look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
Fine Absolutely Must be disappointing though Must come as a hell of a shock
Fine

Well Nadia It it 's all the same to you I 'd like to give it a bash
In every sense If at all possible
I do I want to very badly
In the world
You must think I 'm the biggest pillock In the world
Why else would you send off for me If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
They do n't blame you When a bank employee does this they understand You get your life back Anyway I bet you hated that bank
So what are you going to do
It makes it faster If I do n't speak to the men they fall faster It 's pretty obvious why
It 's makes it easier Okay
I think that about covers it I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though That 's got to hurt I imagine That 's got to smart a bit I mean strictly in my observer 's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously
Oh I do n't know In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals This took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems But you see I 'm not in that line of work anymore Nowadays I 'm a bank robber

Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar
The families who control the casinos
He 'll be dealt with
I took Kobo from the street I gave him a home a future But my ways were too slow for him I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man Kobo would n't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired
I 'm impressed But let 's use the short form I 'm looking for
That would n't be very sporting
One man He must be good
Not to be trapped
Anywhere
Let 's go while there is still time
I do n't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
Mr Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated We 'll appreciate him and he 'll cooperate
He knows what he 's doing
You certainly have a nice place here
We were worried to death It 's awfully kind of you

I want to do it
I think therefore I am
Then we 're stupid and we 'll die
This is my Uncle Roy Sebastian

Your mind kept wandering That bothered me
During the road test
Meaning
No rust
Silicone Valley Lots of these science guys never leave that place We book two shows a month in there Those big time techs and bio guys might be real high zoners up here but when it comes to the arts they like it loud and lewd

For holes
Oh yeah You 'd be surprised what goes on around here I 'd like to check the dressing room if I could
Like to get this position Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person
You have n't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way
There 's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place
Yeah
What
Just wait here
Do n't leave here Do n't open the door do n't answer the phone
Do you think I simulated what happened between us
Do n't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
Why do you call it retire why do n't you call it murder
Ten years
Uh-huh
Have you ever known anybody a long time
You 're sick Deckard
This feels stupid
But then how can you
But if I do n't plug it in how can I
They could clean around the arrangement
Do n't be fooled by appearances
Hmmm
I 'm not sure Is there a secret
I do n't know I think I missed something
I do n't know I have nothing to compare it to I guess I thought there was something more to it
Nobody is freer than when he dreams I read that
Yeah
I wish I could
Do you dream

What do you want me to do
Right
Can you I could n't
I 'm sorry
Do I make you nervous
So
I work alone
Sounds like I 'm an ass-hole either way but the answer is still no
I think you need more help than you 've got
I know you think it complicates your work but I 'm here to help
Ugh
Sounds like you speaks from experience
In your opinion
Why not
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend and you decide to get an abortion
Is this testing whether I 'm an android or a lesbian
I 'd kill it
I 'd take him to the doctor
I would n't accept it Also I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police
Why should I be
Of course not
But because your department ca n't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large it 's a problem Correct Mr Deckard
It seems your department does n't believe out new unit is to the public benefit
Severed spine You 'd better get in here Bryant 's waiting for you
Holden got hit

You know when we do go up I 'm going to miss this old place How 'bout you hon
If we still have one
Let 's eat our cake
Calvin Webber What a thing to say
Well we did in my family
If he tells it wo n't come true
And I made these
You bet
Coming
Hi
I believe there will be other survivors In fact I 'm guessing there 's life on the surface even now It 's not life worth living perhaps but believe me something 's moving around up there And I do n't just mean the cockroaches
Yes you certainly will And you 'll find a nice girl and rebuild America Just the way it used to be
Yes he 's very bright dear Much like his father But you know Calvin maybe he 's a little young for school
What
Yes Well yes
No reason Well it 's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off So you know when the time is up we 'll have to return to the surface using you know this back entrance Which is very nice because it has the service elevator
Oh I was just examining this rear hatchway
Right here
What Whatever you want Helen
Yes
No I think it 's just right
I 've noticed
Is there a problem
Uh oh Now it 's time
Oh no
You have tranquilizers
No No Calvin this is different Believe me
Maybe I 've just got the creeps
No Calvin you 're favorite
I 'm not hungry
All our friends
No
To go up
It 's safe
Thirty five years
The locks
What 's that noise
Home sweet home
Yes dear
I 've read up on it I 'll deliver the baby myself if I have to
Rather safe than sorry That 's my motto
I do n't know For this thing to blow over it could take days
Yeah yeah Okay Give me the roast and watch your step I 'll come back for the radio
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip
I just hope those plates are n't radioactive by tomorrow morning
Yes
I never know anymore
Did you rig it to do that You 're so clever
Time Oh no Calvin It 's not time yet I still have
We 'll do this again Maybe next week Here 's your hat Could I wrap something up for you Did you have a coat
You bet hon
Sorry honey I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat
I guess we should n't fight in here
Yeah Before I kick your ass
You know I do n't know And looking at you I do n't care It 's been too long Eve
Shana Gillroy 's apartment Remember her The model who went to Harvard Well I better get going Bye Adam Nice coat
This is Adam Adam meet Cliff
You came back for these
I forgot some of my stuff
What are you bitching about now
Where
Yeah Maybe he 'll call
None of this stuff was here in 1962 The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards
Come on
What
You did n't stop anywhere else
Then what
Well at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich That 's new Wait a minute He said today he knew where home was What happened this morning Where did you go
He was always so nice How was I supposed to know that 's a good thing Nice is weird Nice is what is nice It 's not cool I 'll tell you that Was it ever
Have him committed
See these Found them in the box with the cards These are stock certificates IBM AT T Polaroid
What 's wrong
And if we ca n't find him
What do you want to do with it
Good God you do n't think there really is a bomb shelter do you
Gay
Oh no
Well what was I supposed to do He wants me to live underground with him That 's like Silence of the Lambs do n't you think
I do n't think so
What are you going to do Go over to her place and kick in the door
It 's true She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear
He left with Sophie
He did n't leave with them
From the oddest place His parent 's told him I do n't think I got that memo
Exactly I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses Turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible That 's it If you do n't do that nothing else matters The cars the clothes the houses
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady
You know I asked him about that And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them See you 'd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners I did n't know that I thought it was a way of appearing superior Know what else he told me
Yes you do
Uh yes you do
Yes you do
What Now hold on Wait one damn minute
To bed
Where are you going
Those sluts
I 'm his pimp He left with the dancers did n't he
Who did he leave with
What 's that mean
He go back to the hotel
Go to the bathroom
Um Eve
Well I 'm trying to educate him It 's nothing personal
Are you kidding You would n't even be a crumb on her table You do n't see that
Always good advice
He 's from Alaska
No
Let me show you the entire trousseau
Well what do you think
I 'm busy tomorrow anyway I have to buy six thousand paper napkins
That 's what I 'm sensing
I see elegant
I 'm sorry But if the shoe fits
It means that your taste in men 's apparel is as bad as your taste in men
You 're serious are n't you
I do n't know
But first you have to start with the clothes
Give me your hand
Oh yes
Out-of-town That 's all he 'll say
Darlin this is X-File stuff Think about it The guy 's got all this easily negotiable property He 's obviously setting something up very big Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America for instance Or perhaps he 's the head of a cult that 's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco I 've heard worse
Eve This guy is un-be-liev-able

So are you I mean you 're a neat guy We better get back
I do n't know I had a dream In fact the night I met you In the dream the world was dark because there were n't any robins You know birds Robins stood for love and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference I guess until the robins come there is trouble
You 're sure right It is a strange world
Who me Why should it
Yeah
Did you see her undressed
Twice Without her sensing anything
You saw a lot in one night
Wow Should you tell my father
You want to tell me about it
You want a Dairy Queen

Okay thanks
Are you sure
Yeah
Look it can wait till Sunday
Oh okay can I call

I 'll drink to that
Two
This is not my usual Friday night
Brilliant
What 's the plan
Yeah but do n't pick me up My father may think it 's strange I 'll walk over to your house I 'll be there at eight o'clock
I already know The Slow Club It 's on Route 7
I 'll tell Mike I 'm sick There 's a game tonight anyway and he 'll never miss me Afterwards he can go out with the guys Just so the record is kept straight though I love Mike What do want me to do
You really want to do this do n't you
Yes I do
I owe you since I goofed up this one
So what 's next
Yeah if it opens the door
No I only saw his back He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall
I was just about to go to the door when that man did my job for me Was it alright
Are you alright
Thanks Dorothy Vallens Okay goodluck Three minutes no sooner
Okay I 'm going ahead Wait a minute what 's her name
Alright
You 've got a point there
I do n't know it sounds like a good daydream but actually doing it is too weird Too dangerous
What will I say when she comes to the door
Now how are you going to do that
It would n't hurt to hear the plan I guess
You said it was a strange world And you 're the strangest part of it Are you crazy She is possibly involved in murder This gives me the creeps
Alright now tell me What is it
I guess Mike 's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon
I do n't want to cause any trouble
I 'd like to talk to you about something
You hungry or thirsty or both
I guess so Like you said It 's a strange world
Thanks for the tour It was nice talking to you
I do n't know He moved away
It 's not bad but it 's bad enough It 's a lot worse for my father I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world
I have to help out in my father 's hardware store They 're giving me sort of my own hours for a while which is nice
You really do hear a lot do n't you
Oh yeah What about those other people Anything
Did they find out anything when they questioned her
Where are they
Not really why You want to see the building Come on I 'll show you
Yeah It 's close by that 's what 's creepy They 've had her under surveillance for a couple of months except I do n't know what they 've found out because my father is n't in charge of her
Maybe so
No this has been going on for some time Several months About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river They were from people who were reported missing They never found one complete body only parts
There were at least three maybe four But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear There 's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned And a musician And some others
I do n't really know much but bits and pieces I hear things My room is right above my father 's office The ear there 's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person That 's direct from the Coroner 's Office The person is unknown There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear I heard some of the same names
Did n't my father tell you not to talk about it
That 's too bad
Yeah What are you doing now
Terrible boring
Yes
Am I bothering you
You were pretty popular Did n't you run for some office
I just know that 's all I remember you from Central
You shut up Nobody 's talkin to you Hey who 's that Jeffrey Your mother

It 's gon na look like the bad guys are killing each other
Possible but unlikely The angles are too extreme A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gon na shoot straight ahead He would n't cock out his elbows makes no sense Besides you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds No way Had to be at least two

I want to stand for what I believe in father
You 're right

Has he now
Yes
Yes
But in this day and age I believe what they do is necessary I feel it is correct
It 's ethics I put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these cocksuckers to slip through I 've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist As if they have God 's permission But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them technically
Why have I come to a church I never have before I guess I just felt I should
Y-Yes my son

What 's he in for
So how is it in there
Does it float
Where
How big is it
You 're living on a sailboat
What do you mean
We 're not sure
We have n't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital His case got dismissed
The grandfather clock
What 'd he get
You got to be kidding me
He did
So is Mr Henry going to come by and see me or anything
Like amnesia
Dignan it 's too late
There 's not enough time
What are you talking about
What
Come on
You 're kidding
Wait for Kumar
What are you doing
I do n't know
It 's the fire alarm Somebody pulled the fire alarm
Careful Check his pulse
Get against the wall
Freeze
It 's going back down
It was Bob His walkie talkie 's busted
Check the fucking elevator It 's moving
Stand by Bird Dog
Good It 's supposed to be
Any activity
OK Roger
Uh-huh
We all set
You 're all clear
Bird Dog to Scarecrow Bird Dog to Scarecrow
Yes I do
As a person
He was all right
I do n't think I ever said this to you But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened
I do n't want to be too much of a liability
I 'll try not to hold you back tomorrow
Or I might end up with a broken nose
Next week we 'll be drinking piña coladas
Yeah It 's pretty good
I did
Eleven fifteen
I 'm sorry Bob
What the fuck are we doing out here
Easy Dignan It 's OK
No Dignan This is n't
He does n't want to fight
Dignan Take it easy
What do you think
You could give somebody a concussion
What time did he say to be here
What exactly is this place Freezers
Who 's Mr Henry
What 's Hinckley Cold Storage
What is it
You really hit a guy with a bottle
Sure
Who 's in the car
When 'd you get back
Shut up
I know that But
Her name 's Inez Stop calling her the housekeeper
She needed it
383
I had to give some to Inez
I know
That 's not correct
You 're so spoiled What is not good to you Only a few hundred
You ca n't just run home every time things get tough First of all we 've got enough dough to
Do n't panic Anthony
No I 'm serious He made me a diagram
Yes I do Bob taught me
I do n't think we need any keys Dignan I think I can hotwire a car for us
No one to back me up Now I have a good idea So unless you come up with something better
Look I 'm ready to get the fuck out of here It 's real torture for me to be here Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans
She does n't need to know
I know we can It 's real simple We go into a room grab some car keys and
Inez has a master key to all these rooms does n't she Does n't she
I have an idea for that
I do n't really feel like talking about it The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place
Would of been nice
Can you hand me those french fries
OK
No I 'm going to swim I 'll see you later
Well the world is a little bit colder today
If you 'd gone with Bob you 'd probably be in Weatherford by now Of course I 'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I 'd be dead
So when you were saying Bob 's at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act You were just
If you wanted to go What were you going to do Just leave me here by myself
He told you and you let him do it
Where was I
When 'd he tell you
We said 48 hours
He took his stuff He 's gone I should of seen this I should of expected it Bob does n't have any character
That coward Son of a bitch
Where was it parked
Yes It 's true
They blamed my family for everything They always said Mr Langston saved Anthony 's life
Mr Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation CPR I 've never said this before but frankly I thought Anthony was dead The veins in his face were all sticking out His skin was blue He truly did look dead
See one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr Langston 's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious I had to dive in and save him
See now we 've got a plan
Obviously That 's a given
Now that makes sense We 'll hang out for a couple of days Get a little R R Make sure Future Man 's OK and then get back on the road
He needs to hire an attorney
She 's from Cuba
Which one was that
They do n't
Anthony we 're on the run from the law here Did you tell these people your real name
What the fuck is going on here
May I have a word with you please
Inez this is
This is Inez Carmen Anita
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut
No Dignan I 'm sorry I ca n't do that
Dignan I ca n't get my hair cut That 's just not possible all right
Yeah but you would n't have the truck if you blew it up
It 's not a plan It 's just
I know But once you get inside you 're home free
It 's a great shirt Do n't worry about it
Look man She did n't know anything about shirts
You owe me fifty bucks
OK Go ahead
I 'll just say it
Do n't call me spoiled Dignan
You 've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life Dignan In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E
Well those treads stink You 'd blow a knee out racing on those
What about them
Yes they are
See if mine are in there
I keep it for emergencies
I do n't want to use it
Because my mom gets the bill
I do n't like to use that credit card Dignan
Do n't even say it man
He was the driver Dignan He did what he 's supposed to do
What do you think
Like I 'm going to hunt you down and kill you
Yeah
I swear to God In a very quiet voice
What about what that guy said
Holy shit
Is that the manager
There 's another stocker right
Where 's the manager
Calm down Take a deep breath
You 're out I 'm not working with either one of you
No Dignan It 's not your gun It 's all of ours
Nothing Go ahead
That 's a good question No I do n't I 'm just being hypocritical here However I will say
OK Escape route The most important thing you can have is an escape route Just in case somebody 's tailing us Or even chasing us as the case may be
Loop around real fast
Is it back in
But he did n't say anything
Eight dollars
Five seven eight dollars
It had an alarm
That sets it off
Dignan it 's got an alarm
Yeah I saw it
That 's not what I meant Dignan
How was I ridiculing you
Where are you going
Yeah but I ca n't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary There 's just not time for it
Every valuable item in the house was on that list
I know about money Anthony I know the value of money Plus the earrings are worth three times that
Anthony we 'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone That 's less than what it 's appraised at
It 's got a V-8 Dignan
She 's really kind of hot
Now that window can never be locked It 's impossible
Would they do that
Kind of Except we 've already got the keys
No This is he
He says This is he
The point is the killer always goes May I speak to Starsky He says his name
As part of his plan I do n't know why
No It 's a real episode The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones
He 's not there Huggie Bear is n't in every single episode
Dignan it 's
Right The blond guy
Black hair Paul Michael Glaser
HENRY Because I was like you once And there was no one there to help me
HENRY Absolutely
HENRY We 're renegades from despair
Yeah
HENRY I want to ask a favor boys One day when I 'm long gone and all but forgotten make one last toast to Abe Henry And remember me as a friend
HENRY Anthony I 'm petrified
HENRY Bob Bob That 's a palindrome I love palindromes
HENRY The fear of death The pain of consciousness Did you mix this martini
HENRY Exactly Woah
HENRY Are you afraid
HENRY No that door over there
HENRY I 'll tell you Anthony Times like this I get philosophical What does it mean What 's it all about Are you afraid to die
HENRY Well he agreed 100 that Bob should be dropped And he also agreed you were a liability But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses
HENRY Yes he did
It feels good
HENRY Take a deep breath
HENRY The Abe Henry double-cross test You just made a perfect score
HENRY Congratulations You passed the test
And you 're wrong if you think I 'd turn my back on a friend
I do n't think you 're giving him enough credit I know sometimes he does n't think an idea through He gets too excited But
What do you mean what kind of person He 's a good person
I 'm not really sure I think it 's Irish Or maybe
So do I
HENRY Yeah And I 'll tell you who we 're going to want Kumar Banijamali
HENRY Yeah Convert it into lofts OK Pop quiz What 's the single most important aspect of your job
HENRY Technique That 's right Seventy five percent of your job is crowd control Seventy-five percent Do you believe that
Grammar
Thanks
HENRY It 's called a racquet Anthony and you 're holding it wrong That 's ghetto play Hold it like this
Thanks
Nice to meet you
Temporarily
His health is n't very good you know They take that into account
Who 's got the car keys
I did n't do anything
No
My walkie talkie 's busted I ca n't tell what 's going on
Sure
Nothing I was just asking
You OK Bob
Give him a second
Yeah Let 's keep it
Let 's not even talk about it
Was Future Man adopted
Well because you guys do n't look alike
Were you adopted Bob
I thought he did n't have to pay anything because of the technicality
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary
Sixty days
I do n't like that word prank Bob I was trying to do something more than a prank
It took six months of research I did all the wiring myself Switched AC to DC Doubled the voltage Shorted out the generator The whole school was shut down
I know it must of been a bad experience But it does n't sound like it was your fault
You do n't have to talk about it if you do n't want to
You think I 'm improving
Cause I 'm not getting any better It 's a waste of time
I 'm not playing any more golf
Is that OK
And if Future Man does n't get let out of jail in 48 hours then we go back All right
I do n't know I do n't know anything Except Phil says they got him And he 's in jail
He looked too shaken-up
OK Dad
Nobody does
Why do n't you just tell them the truth Those belong to my neighbor Phil
Where you going
I hope not
There 's a million places to hide around here
What was that
See you Bob
Yeah He said that
Let them fight
You could make your own cinnamon toast
Could you grow cinnamon
Hector woud n't do anything
In your backyard How do you protect them
What do herbs have to do with it I do n't understand the
Did you ever steal a car before
Who
God That does sound corny Oh your skin feels so soft and silky But it really kind of does
What What
Does my skin feel soft Anthony
Cuba
It could happen This is the exact kind of place where it happens But I do n't want to scare you
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms
Dies y nueve
Where were you
Where 'd they come from
What do you mean
Abdul-Shabazz
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
I hear you 're a good thief
You 're Anthony
Bob Get back in position
True
Well this is n't really a party per se
Hell no This is a '72 I was driving a '63 Pontiac
We 're going too slow It looks like we 're following him
Looks like he 's staying with Buckethead That 's what I figured He 's probably got his own room Let 's see where he 's going
Yeah
That 's Anthony
Is that him
We might have to take that chance Cause I feel pretty strongly about this
Just settling an old score You might say revenge
There 's a lot of valuable shit in there Applejack The silver and the china The crystal And the grandfather clock Goddammit I bet that clock 's worth ten grand
RICHARD It seemed like a good idea at the time
RICHARD I do n't know about that
RICHARD You 're the faggot
Now
Here we go
I do n't really want to talk about it Bob
No I have a cellmate His name 's Carl
We do n't have rooms Bob We have cells
That 's just what the DA asked CRS is a disease where you ca n't remember shit
I said to the DA That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease
Applejack drove
Where 's Applejack
Take him to the car Bob
Jesus Christ What the fuck is that
Is he breathing
He 's having a heart attack or something
Who 's watching the door What the fuck are you doing Get back in position
Stand by Bird Dog
Yeah We 're in the elevator How 's it look back there
Yeah
Jesus Christ
Come on Bob
That 's OK
I 'm sorry Bob
It was n't your fault Bob You had your brother
Come on
Bullshit
I never agreed to that
Man I do n't want to go into this
I do n't expect an apology and I do n't even want one I just want us to
Yeah It is
Not a whole lot Bob
Not bad
Anthony Bad news
Let 's go
That 's right I only have one vote We 'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out
OK Bob I do n't know his name You know why Because I do n't care He 's Future Man But I care about you And to me it does n't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime Will you get in the car Bob This is stupid
Just get in the car Bob
Yes I do
I know it 's not
Future Man would never go to jail for you I 'll tell you that
Do n't threaten me Bob
I ca n't do that Bob
Good luck since I got the keys
Not in that car you 're not
Do n't Come on Dignan me
This could be a trap
Bob that makes no sense
What do you mean get back
Then how come they have n't set the bail yet That 's unconstitutional
How long has he been in there
So tell them the truth What do you use it for
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house Everybody has a scale
That could be anybody 's
I do n't think they can make it stick Bob I mean what do they actually have on Future Man
But it 's not his How can they arrest Future Man
What are you talking about
You can go first Bob
Bob Are you coming
What the fuck possessed you
I 'm sure he did We 'll have to get new plates
Is he chasing us
Shit Bob What the fuck did you do that for
In all probability nothing would of happened But why take the chance That 's why I ran I mean how many plants were even back there Five Ten
I told you they were there
Bob I 've got nightmares
I mean Jesus Christ Bob You did n't have some vicious lunatic screaming I 'm going to remember you
Bob will you please listen
You really think he 'll remember you
Was Dignan screaming like Get me a bag
How much is there
Did we get it
This is natural
What happened
What are you doing
That 's too bad
His name was Swifty
He electrocuted someone
Yeah but what if some nut pulled gun on you
He does n't get it Held never understand what we 're trying to accomplish here It 's too dangerous for him
I paid for it
What 's your fucking problem You 're a shithead
Bob
That 's your domain
Hang on This is important Bob Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation The money and the people You 're responsible for the external situation The streets and the getaway
Let 's just go
Maybe she turned
I do blame you Bob And woah Look at her
I know that now He 's a fucking psycho
You said it like it was a big joke Bob Like he 's wild
The guy is fucking insane
What did I say
What was that all about
You 're paranoid Bob
Good question
You should take a look I have an entire crop in my backyard
As much as I want When these plants bud I 'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
I 'll just drive my car
It 's true Dignan
Yes I did
Can you use a coaster
If you 're that worried maybe we should just steal one
That never would of
My brother
They are
No
I 'm not allowed to drive those
Well what do you think
I 'd appreciate it if you did n't go around telling people lies about me
John I 'm twenty-six years old I did n't run away from home
Yeah Hey Clay
MAN Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting
MAN How 's that 700 bucks coming
He said you ran away from home
Your brother was up here the other day He said you ran away from home

He left yesterday on the night train He 's probably just getting in now You 'll have to hurry
Save it for Bourne
What do you mean
One last push One
Anything else
And the Landy woman
Will it track back to us
There was a mistake
Well you 're probably right I guess that 's all that hubris is
In the end honestly it 's hubris Simple hubris You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are
Had to be done
Why not It was just money
I 'm not a traitor I 've served my ountry
I do n't exactly know what to say I 'm sorry
Sit down
Jesus I Zorn I have to call his family Tell them
Moscow What the Hell 's he going to Moscow for
Did he say anything to you
They found Danny Zorn 's body Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time
I was n't sleeping You OK
Well whatever he 's doing I 've had enough this is now a search and destroy mission I want the Berlin police fully briefed and get this out to all the agencies
So what 's he doing You believe him
Do n't you want answers
Hold on he said he wants to come in
And you do From the moment he left Treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him
I 've already got a team there I doubt Bourne 's in Naples to settle down and raise a family
So what 's your theory Conklin 's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name The man is dead
Conklin might 've been a nut but he was n't a mole You have me his calendar for a couple of days I 'll prove he killed Lincoln This is supposed to be definitive
We were throwing money at him Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark
Do you know what his budget was
this is Conklin 's computer
I think I do We had a deal going down in Berlin last week During the buy both our Field Agent and the seller were killed We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that did n't go off They were killed by Jason Bourne
And Bourne Where 's he now
So you had Conklin killed I mean if we 're cutting the crap
I want to know what happened
Let 's talk about Conklin
To know about it It was a kill squad Black on black Closed down two years ago Nobody wants to know about Treadstone Not around here You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you 're doing
And what are we looking for
That 's not gon na fly
Treadstone
Show me again
Who else knows about this
Lots of people
Keep going
Jesus
It was staged
And
What do you have Danny
The sooner the better
Thanks
I 'm sorry
I have to go now
Because you 're afraid
I should kill you if it 's true you should die I should kill you now
YOU 'RE A LIAR
You 're a liar
I do n't want you to forgive me
They loved you And I killed them
It was my job My first time Your father was supposed to be alone But then your mother she came out of nowhere I had to change my plan You understand me You do n't have to live like that anymore Thinking that
Then what
Yes
What
No I do
It 's nothing It 's just a picture
Okay
I speak English

How long How long do I have
You called it in
She really did that Told you not to kill me I had a woman once But after a while what do you talk about I mean for us The work You ca n't tell them who you are
What 's going on in Berlin
Pamela Landy
Who sent you to Greece
You 're lying If it 's over why are they after me
Try again
Conklin
She would n't let me She 's the only reason you 're alive
I like it here Last time I saw you was Greece You had a good spot
Sorry Old habits
Drop it
I emptied it
God I miss you I do n't know what to do without you
You do
It might have
I did
I wanted to kill him
I love you too
Jason please do n't do this it wo n't ever be over like this
There must be another way
What if it 's not who you think it is
Where are you going

Look we clear out we get to the shack we get safe We hang there awhile I 'll come back I 'll check it out But right now we ca n't
We ca n't wait to be sure
Back there at the corner Hyundai silver

Sleep Sleep now
It 's just a nightmare
I 'm trying Marie Okay
We write them down because sooner or later you 're going to remember something good
it has n't been two years
You 're sure We should still we should write it down
I 'll get the book
Where were you Jason In the car
I was here
You never worked Berlin
Your first assignment was Geneva
No You never worked Berlin
What do you mean
He closed down Treadstone he took care of me after Paris
Please I 'm only here because of Paris because they ca n't figure out what you 're doing I 'm here because of Abbott
Conklin Stuff on Conklin
I left a fingerprint You fucking people
I killed him
Last week When
A Russian
Say it
What is this a game
They know They know you were here They know you killed these two guys They know you and Conklin had something on the side They do n't know what it is but they know
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE
Who is Pamela Landy
Get on it
See that tram coming around the corner
You did n't answer my question
Do n't need it I remember everything
What 's that
Are you disappointed
Careful
Ramstein Air Base Germany Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital
Alexanderplatz 30 minutes Under the World Clock Alone Give her your phone
There was a girl in Paris Part of the program She used to handle the medication
I want someone I know to take me in
I want to come in
Bourne
Hold on Yep And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room
You 're sure
We 'll know for sure when we get the security tapes
What
I want to look at the room Check it out
the hotel how far
uplink all relevant files to Kim and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone
Then get a number they need to know who they 're dealing with
Who 's going Us
And the Germans ca n't match it
I 'm working on it
shut up just shut the
who who else is here
This is everything Is there
Here
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business That Bourne is still involved And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he 's been hiding to kill again How 's that scan
For a thief A mole I vetted the source Marty He 's real If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects it 's a bargain at ten times the price
We 're talking raw unprocessed KGB files It 's not something we can go out and comparison shop
That 's where we came out
I 'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes which means you are going to call me back in 30 and when I ask you where we stand I had better be impressed My mobile number is
I want that area secured I want any evidence secured and I want it done now Is that clear
Me Four years
Pamela Landy again Where do we stand
Mr Nevins
So
Alright
What do you think Is he coming in
Is it fresh
And why is that
See that 's a problem for me Nicky Whatever he 's doing we need to end it This is n't the kind of mess you walk away from
Some women like Dobermans
Did you
You felt nothing No spark Two young people in Paris Dangerous missions Life and death
Not good enough You 're the person who floated this amnesia story Ever feel sorry for him For what he 'd been through
So he fooled you
Believed what
Are you an expert in amnesia
I 'm curious about Bourne Your interpretation of his condition You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions
Good luck
Amnesia
What kind of problems
Yes In that order
We 're looking at all Berlin outbound Good news is every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed digital security cameras Common feed
His wife In room 645 Then she shot herself
Here 's what I 've got Remember Vladimir Neski Russian politician Seven years ago he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel He never did He was murdered
Black coat possibly leather Dark slacks Dark t-shirt He says they 're gon na try and corral the guests on the street over there and then check them out but
No Munich 's a bust He 's loose
What the hell is a Treadstone
Do we know what this says
Then we 'll just have a peek at the wounds Dig 'em up
What it means in England and in Scotland too is that rebels have forfeited their lands We were ambushed last night But the Scots dragged their dead away
Someone dead from this household
What are they doing
It was in Latin sir
Did n't want your father to die either did ya But it happened
We 'll sleep here tonight You 'll come home with me We 'll let the house and the lands too plenty of willing neighbors
I will meet you but only one way if Robert the Bruce is there and puts his hand on my Bible and swears his loyalty to Scotland
So let the council swear publicly
You 've all sworn to Longshanks
It is suicide
We can not defeat this
We must sue for peace
Invade That 's impossible it
But what will you do
Longshanks promised
He wo n't come
The crown is that of Scotland And Scotland is William Wallace
If I pay homage to another 's throne then how am I a king
He was a modest man
No But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything The Balliols will kiss his ass so we must
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride But he sends his greetings and says that I speak for all the Bruces And for Scotland
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here
Young Robert we are honored
His legend grows It will be worse than before
But if we have not caught Wallace
The Scots will fight for us
So the Scots will have none of them will they My armorers have already made a thousand
Impossible How dare you bring a panicky lie
I have ordered conscriptions
Nothing new Majesty We have sent riders to speed any word
I hear This Wallace is a bandit nothing more
Before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead
I respect him At worst he was a worthy enemy Show mercy Oh thou great king and win the respect of your own people
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace
When will his trial be
Is it true Wallace is captured
The little cow is insane
Wallace 's followers
You mock us with a smile
You may
Now my flower do you understand
No M'lord
His majesty was quite keen that you should understand
Scotland He intends
You directed me to report to you the moment the king 's conference was ended
No One of us is enough
My dreams of Marion are gone I killed them myself If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death I 'd welcome it
We 've lived a dream together A dream of freedom
Nor I I want to live I want a home and children and peace I 've asked god for those things But He 's brought me this sword And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country then I 'll do that too
Probably But we ca n't win alone We know that This is the only way
Your rest is making me exhausted
Rest William
Thanks for the food and drink And for bringing 'em yourselves
Stephen ready
The Bruce is not coming William
We make spears A hundred spears Fourteen feet long
I 'll wait back there
Good to see you again
You 'll move
Can you do it when it matters As it matters in battle Could you crush a man with that throw
I still say this is no test A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can
Call it a test of soldiery then The English wo n't let us train with weapons so we train with stones
Test of manhood
We 'll get those English pigs tomorrow
Wan na stay with me tonight
With your father and brother gone they 'll kill us and burn the farm
Armed
How many
They used hounds on us in Ireland it 's the only way
We must run in different directions
A common thief
In order to find his equal and Irishman is forced to talk to God Yes Father The Almighty says do n't change the subject just answer the fookin question
All right Father I 'll ask him If I risk my neck for you will I get a chance to kill Englishmen
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break
He broke because of me I saw it He lost all will to fight
He was so brave With courage alone he nearly won
He will fight you forever But what does he fight for Freedom first and peace So grant them
I have faced him Have you
Forgive me Sire I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
No I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support His army starves Our stall has worked he must withdraw You may return to your embroidery
You spoke with this Wallace in private What kind of man is he
Then why does he stay My scouts say he has not advanced
My son 's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen So he accepted our bribe
Shall I leave M'lord
Your pardon M'lord he asked me to come in his stead
Then on the morrow thou shalt receive they purification And in the end I promise you 'll beg for the axe
Confess and you may receive a quick death Deny and you must be purified by pain Do you confess DO YOU CONFESS
It matters not he is thy king
Against thy king thou vile fool Hast thou anything to say
Tonight
My parents are growing suspicious I ca n't keep meeting you every night
Shush It 's only been a day And it 's seemed like forever
I will be with you like this Forever
I do n't want to scare you I want to be yours and you mine Every night like this one
But I wo n't give you up to any nobleman
I 'm not just saying it
I want to marry you
Did it work
You 've been here before
I 'll invite you again but your mother thinks I 'm crazy
Thank you for accepting
Your father does n't like me does he
I need you so much I love you
I do n't want to wake I want to stay with you
I 'm dreaming
Knowing his passion for his lost love they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place Now that is romance Oui
This Scottish rebel Wallace He fights to avenge a woman
He should n't be telling secrets in bed
How do you know this
I ca n't bear the thought of your torture Take it
Drink this It will dull your pain
You will die It will be awful
Mercy is to die quickly Perhaps even live in the Tower In time who knows what can happen if you can only live
Sir I come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
No But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost Or simply love me because I love you
You understand Consider before you laugh and say no You will never own a throne though you deserve one But just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule England And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks but with that of a true king
You have you have a husband
Why did you
A meeting in a barn It had to be a trap And only you would know I would be aware of it
I understand you have suffered I know about your woman
Peace is made is such ways
Let us talk plainly You invade England But you can not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply The King proposes that you withdraw your attack In return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which I am to pay to you personally
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots even women and children from the city walls
I have been given nothing God makes men what they are
But now that I am here will you speak with a woman
I come as the king 's servant and with his authority
I am the Princess of Wales
I must consult with my father
I am trying
Nobles What does that mean to be noble Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country But men do n't follow titles they follow courage Your arm speaks louder than your tongue Our people know you Noble and common they respect you If you would lead them toward freedom they would follow you And so would I
We all end up dead It 's only a question of how And why
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
Aye But it wo n't let me dream
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
No English lord would trust an Irishman
Exactly
The dogs have a scent My scent Someone must have given it to them
They 've tricked us
BOSWELL When I asked Evan about his drawing well he did n't remember doing it
BOSWELL Of course There is one more thing Mrs Treborn And I feel bad for mentioning it
BOSWELL Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up Most of them made drawings of what their parents did but this
BOSWELL I was going to show this to the principal but I wanted to talk to you first
BOSWELL Mrs Treborn I need to speak with you
No dances just tell me
REDFIELD Actually these tests were n't available twenty years ago
Evan wake up oh please wake up
REDFIELD It 's worth a shot I can arrange a controlled meeting A careful dose of sedatives for Jason some security you and I monitoring Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex
REDFIELD You 'd be surprised how often they are
REDFIELD Plenty Who knows Maybe he 's got severe coping problems about not having a father Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend 's dad
REDFIELD If I had to guess I 'd say the blackouts are stress related
REDFIELD Unfortunately we 've got nothing to work with It 's harder playing detective now
REDFIELD Well the good news is that the results are negative I 've found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors
Why What for
Anything
Just tell me that Evan does n't have Jason 's illness
Not according to his teacher It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan 's inherited his father 's condition
Do n't worry I 'm gon na get you out of here
You told me that on Parents Weekend Remember Wait that was n't me Or you
Come on Mom Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy does n't mean that I 'm nuts
I just need the entry about the blockbuster Wait shit no arms I never even got the chance to write it
There must be a way to fix this
What does that mean for Evan
Okay doc What 's the damage How much time have I got
Damn it Mom I told you I need them all
How 's Kayleigh doing She all right
How long will I be in here
What What could he do
Sure
When he was around your age almost exactly your age He said he figured out a trick to remember the past
Why do you ask
Please He got straight A 's without ever touching a book That was the one area where his memory never failed him
I ca n't help it I 'm just so proud of you You 've got the highest grades in all of your classes
Do n't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
Something must 've happened What set him off
Okay
I I do n't remember
What happened
These 'll bring you luck Crockett
That 's why I wanted you to come here Evan Dr Redfield already has a background in memory loss
I do n't like this place Mom It 's creepy Please can we go I promise I wo n't make any more bad pictures
No
All the dads are gon na be there
We 've been over this a hundred times It 's too dangerous for him
You know the answer to that
Darn it
Righty-tighty lefty-lucy
When did you ever care about getting to school on time
So you believe me
What did you see What did it look like
Weirder than this
You need to see the prison shrink man
I ai n't bullshitting Jesus speaks to me in my dreams
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose For you to help me
You 're religious Carlos you believe that bit about the Lord works in mysterious ways
Can you protect me
Photos
But I I need those books
My journals Where are they
Where are my goddamn books
Lem me guess Would that be where the memories are stored
Are you sure Not even with my father
It 's coming argh I ca n't
I ca n't the car vanishes and all of a sudden I 'm on the ground in the woods
I see a car
No protecting her
I 'm standing next to Kayleigh my hands are over her ears
Yes
REDFIELD Not in this wing actually No
You know my father
Sorry dude Just figured it 'd be okay with you bein sick and all
Fuck off frat boy
Whasamatter Lost your Rolex
What
Shhh I need quiet for this
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr Miller took his shirt off
You really think he wanted to kill you
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure it gets all of the worm 's memories
It 's an experiment with flatworms and a maze You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he 's memorized it Then you put a new flatworm in the maze He 's clueless Banging into walls getting lost whatever
I thought you were a December baby
Why not But that 's not how things wound up I 'm with Lenny Lenny 's your friend And there it ends
Well a lot of things cross my mind I 've always been a fast thinker Ev I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second Boom we fall in love get married two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots the whole bit It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine
It 's crossed my mind from time to time
When my folks split they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with I could n't stand my dad but I knew if I moved to my mom 's I 'd never see you again
That 's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother
Sure Evan why not You were the first person I really ever cared about
Yeah I think I got ta get these fixed or something
He saved Mrs Halpern Please the twisted fuck
Stop Take me back
Where are we going
I 'm over it Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit
Do n't think I 'll need it where I 'm going
There is no fuckin way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin sorority
There 's one major hole in your story
Know what
Then forget that How about you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you it reminds you of your step-sister
Shit I dunno How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh
I could n't give a shit if you believe me or not and frankly I 'm too tired to prove it to you
I never thought you would That 's why I 've never bothered to tell a soul until now and why I never will again
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts
Yeah
Different How
Why 's that
You would n't believe me I mean people always say You would n't believe me but in this case it 's not even worth trying
The bottom When you 're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack
No Just that you need to hurt me with it I 've been where you 've been
I get it You can drop it now
Nice to see you too Can I come in
Now 's the only time Today you get a chance to redeem yourself Start over with a clean slate Tabula rasa
I want you to take this Lenny Today 's your day of atonement I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby
Evan stop You 're gon na kill him
Wait Something 's not right Is n't that your jacket
I ca n't put my finger on it but everything 's a bit off Even the dinner tonight It was beautiful but
I do n't know You seem different You make weird jokes Your accents changed You do n't even walk the same
It 's just you 've been acting kinda strange you know
Are you okay
Do n't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit because you turned out fine
Yeah right Tell that to Crockett
Might a been nice Like this is gon na do any good Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun
Simple math When I woke up this morning and saw your smile I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
Go on Sit down
You 'll see
As if my dad could 've stopped me from seeing you What 's he gon na do to me
Yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird
Oh my God that was good Where 'd you learn all those new tricks
Well I remember he had one but he like put it away after the first day Why would that freak me out
Those are your clothes silly
Mmmm You give good compliment Clean up and come back to bed
Who are you trying to convince Evan You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything 's all better now Well fuck you Evan Nothing 's gon na be all better Okay Nothing ever gets better
Just shut up Evan You 're wasting your breath
Is that why you came all the way back To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood
It was a long time ago
What do you want to know Evan
Well sure I 'll try to remember Shoot
Of course
Me Are you kidding Why
She had a new family Not enough space for me Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids But whatever
Not if you remember my dad
No I emancipated myself when I was fifteen
So how 's Tommy
Not since we were kids
No Evan I do n't know It 's been a long time Fill me in
God Evan I never thought I 'd see you again How 've you been
Welcome home Thought you might like some fresh air for a change
Did your mom say if Lenny was okay
He 's been acting real strange lately He wo n't even look me in the eyes anymore
What are you talking about What you deserve is a better brother and father All they do is make you feel like shit
Damn Your dad did this
I 'm sorry
You really do n't remember anything that happened
Shit Lenny What 's happened to you We 've got ta get help
So let 's go This place creeps me out
Been there done that
And I 'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors One step closer and I 'll shove this up your ass
Listen close then fuckbag You screw up again and I swear I 'll flat out castrate you
Let 's just say you 're being closely watched George Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like oh let 's say like how a loving father treats his daughter Sound okay to you Papa
It 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father Ultimately it 'll lead to her suicide Nice work daddy
Wrong answer fuckbag This is the very moment of your reckoning In the next thirty seconds you 're going to open one of two doors The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood
What time is it
MILLER Quit acting like some retard or I 'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you 've been
MILLER Calm down kid Stand still
MILLER That 's right Evan and you get to be the star
Bullshit I 'll send you a postcard when I 've made everything perfect again
Who 's to say you ca n't make things better
But it did n't And now I need info to make things right again and you 're the only one who can give it to me
Look Jason I need some fast answers if I 'm ever gon na fix what I 've done
Uh-huh Mom says I have your eyes and your
I 'd say blow me Get the pledges to do it
Damn Evan on the D.L
Me neither
Evan you 're hysterical You study for this
Evan Treborn
I still owe you an essay from last week Is there any way I could get an extension
I wo n't let you down Professor Carter
CARTER I know I know Who can think of worms when your libido 's in full swing right
CARTER Whoa Did n't mean to scare you Evan Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming
CARTER Typical psych major A complete wise ass And how 's your project coming Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation
Maybe because they never do So Don Juan you pass out on all your dates
It was like Tommy was possessed or something There was a hate in his eyes that I could n't really call human
Deal Now read me something
Wow read something
Most guys tuck their porn under here but all you have are comp books
Thumper had a busy afternoon
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function it 'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain
If I had n't blown my arms off Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place Now shhhh
Shhh I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I 'm gon na destroy it
Duly noted Now I 'm gon na ask you for one last favor
My mom packed for me I think she sent everything I ever owned So we 'll see
Forget it What 's the point of Psych now Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh
Y yes I guess I did
Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep
I could n't cut the rope
That should buy you ten minutes at least
Can can Can I have this
Mom Do n't cry I can change this
Lung cancer
I did what you said man We 're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we 're going to have an Awareness Dance
Listen to me good Evan
No one thinks you 're a piece of shit Tommy
What the hell are you doing
Leave us alone you sick fuck
Look what you made me do
Hurry Let 's go Get him up Evan Come on
Tommy I 'm bored shitless over here What 's up already
Hey what 'd you do that for
None taken Hey uh does Kayleigh Miller still work here
I come from a big family
Huh
Aw hey now that was a compliment
Oh my God oh my God
I 'm sorry
Just blow something up Are you nuts There 's an art to mass destruction Would you just paint the Mona Lisa No Besides we 're here already
What did I say about mentioning that bitch
I thought I was the bad guy
I do n't think Evan gets to be in it
Yeah you do that Lenny
Ai n't gon na work this time buddy Look how small that fuse is I 'll get killed
What No frigging way man I 'm not touching that thing
You 're such a retard
He 's just a lucky guy
Yes well everybody in Casablanca has problems Yours may work out You 'll excuse me
Go back to Bulgaria
You want my advice
Nobody ever loved me that much
Will he keep his word
Yes Monsieur
Oh yes
He tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
Yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult It was much more than we thought to get here And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind He wants to help us
Eight weeks We come from Bulgaria Oh things are very bad there Monsieur A devil has the people by the throat So Jan and I we we do not want our children to grow up in such a country
At the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa Well of course he 's losing
He did Captain Renault did
No I mean is he trustworthy Is his word
Monsieur Rick what kind of man is Captain Renault
No of course not Do you mind if I do
My husband is with me too
I came with Captain Renault
Could I speak to you for just a moment please
Monsieur Rick
I see
We read five times that you were killed in five different places
I recognize you from the news photographs Monsieur Laszlo
Yes Monsieur
I 'm sorry It is
Berger Norwegian and at your service sir
Good
Thank you but I hardly think
Well
Yes sir
Yes I come I will do it
But Sacha always puts out that light
Yes I come
The police break up our meeting Herr Rick We escaped in the last moment
Goodnight
Do n't tell me where you 're going
Now you finish locking up will you Carl
Maybe I wo n't have to A bribe has worked before In the meantime everybody stays on salary
How long can I afford to stay closed
Monsieur Rick
Monsieur Rick may I get you a cup of coffee
It shall not happen again Monsieur
I 'm awfully sorry
I am so upset Monsieur Rick You know I ca n't understand
Excuse me Monsieur Rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs The cashier would like some money
Er goodbye sir
Er my check please
Er good luck yes
I shall remember to pay it to myself
Well so long
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha they stay with the place or I do n't sell
Oh by the way my agreement with Sam 's always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits That still goes
It 's certainly not good enough But since I 'm in a hurry it 'll have to do
Rick do n't be a fool Take me into your confidence You need a partner
Well you 're in good company Renault and Strasser probably think so too
I 'll tell him when he comes in
And the carrying charges
So could I And I 'm a poor businessman
Practically no one
You 're a fat hypocrite You do n't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do
Carrying charges my boy carrying charges Here sit down There 's something I want to talk over with you anyhow
No hurry I 'll have it sent over Have a drink with me
My dear Rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy
Suppose we ask Sam Maybe he 'd like to make a change
That 's too bad That 's Casablanca 's leading commodity In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market
What do you want for Sam
You have n't heard my offer
Fine but I would like to buy your cafe
Hello Rick
It was gracious of you to share it with me Good day Mademoiselle Monsieur
He is a difficult customer that Rick One never knows what he 'll do or why But it is worth a chance
Not for sure Monsieur but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man Monsieur I am moved to make one more suggestion why I do not know because it can not possibly profit me but have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit
We 've decided Signor Ferrari For the present we 'll go on looking for two exit visas Thank you very much
I will stay here and keep on trying I 'm sure in a little while
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca I am an influential and respected man It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo You however are a different matter
My dear Mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap Good night Mademoiselle
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
There are only two other alternatives for him
Uh huh Under a safe conduct from me
That is also true except for one destination to return to occupied France
Mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca
And Mademoiselle
Yes
And I said I would never leave you
But what about us
No
You 've got to listen to me Do you have any idea what you 'd have to look forward to if you stayed here Nine chances out of ten we 'd both wind up in a concentration camp Is n't that true Louis
Last night we said a great many things You said I was to do the thinking for both of us Well I 've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing You 're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong
I 'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away
Because you 're getting on that plane
Oh Rick
But it 's all right is n't it You were able to arrange everything
Richard Victor thinks I 'm leaving with him Have n't you told him
All right I will Here 's looking at you kid
All except one He wo n't have you
And Laszlo
Huh But it 's still a story without an ending What about now
When did you first find out he was alive
Why were n't you honest with me Why did you keep your marriage a secret
And then
For the last time put them on the table
Put them on the table
All right I tried to reason with you I tried everything Now I want those letters Get them for me
No Oh Richard I 'm sorry I 'm sorry but but you you are our last hope If you do n't help us Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca
Please Please listen to me If you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth
Richard Richard we loved each other once If those days meant anything at all to you
It was your cause too In your own way you were fighting for the same thing
I know how you feel about me but I 'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
You can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
Please
Richard I had to see you
The stairs from the street
No Rick No you see Victor Laszlo is my husband and was even when I knew you in Paris
Well I 'm not running away any more I 'm settled now above a saloon it 's true but walk up a flight I 'll be expecting you
Did you run out on me because you could n't take it Because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time
Why not After all I got stuck with a railway ticket I think I 'm entitled to know
Well you can tell me now I 'm reasonably sober
Why did you come back To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station
I 'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night
It 's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she 'd heard her whole life a very great and courageous man He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals Everything she knew or ever became was because of him And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love
I do n't know the finish yet
Can I tell you a story Rick
I did n't count the days
Please do n't Do n't Rick I can understand how you feel
I would n't have come if I had known that you were here Believe me Rick it 's true I did n't know
Please
No No Rick Not tonight
I love you so much and I hate this war so much Oh it 's a crazy world Anything can happen If you should n't get away I mean if if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever I 'll be I want you to know
Oh darling
That 's too far ahead to plan
No no Not at my hotel I uh I have things to do in the city before I leave I 'll meet you at the station huh
Yes of course we
But be serious darling You are in danger and you must leave Paris
Strange I know so very little about you
Was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding
Ten years ago Let 's see Yes I was having a brace put on my teeth Where were you
With the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
My German 's a little rusty
Richard they 'll find out your record It wo n't be safe for you here
I 'm sorry for asking I forgot we said no questions
Uh huh
Why I 'm so lucky Why I should find you waiting for me to come along
And I was wondering
In America they 'd bring only a penny I guess that 's about all they 're worth
Here 's looking at you kid
Who are you really And what were you before What did you do and what did you think Huh
There 's still nobody in the world who can play As Time Goes By like Sam
Say goodnight to Sam for me
I remember every detail The Germans wore gray you wore blue
Not an easy day to forget
It was La Belle Aurore
Play it Sam Play As Time Goes By
Play it once Sam for old time 's sake
You used to be a much better liar Sam
Does he always leave so early
When will he be back
Where is Rick
Some of the old songs Sam
It 's been a long time
Hello Sam
Are you ready Ilsa
Be careful
Yes Yes I know Victor whatever I do will you believe that I that
No Victor there is n't
Yes Victor I was
Yes
Yes He said Ask your wife I do n't know why he said that
He suggested I ask you
But no intention of selling them One would think if sentiment would n't persuade him money would
Apparently he has the letters
To tell you the truth I am frightened too Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding or shall I carry on the best I can
I must Besides it is n't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife
Our faithful friend is still there
What happened with Rick
He does Could we have a table close to him
Yes I see When I had trouble getting out of Lille why did n't you leave me there And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why did n't you leave me then
But Victor if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
No Victor no
We are only interested in two visas Signor
Goodnight
Goodnight
Be careful
We have been in difficult places before have n't we
This time they really mean to stop me
You are very kind
Victor I I feel somehow we should n't stay here
I 'm afraid Major Strasser would insist
I ca n't get over you two She was asking about you earlier Rick in a way that made me extremely jealous
Well then perhaps you also
Hello Rick
Is what
Rick Who 's he
Yes
Captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere I have seen him
I understand
Yes
Monsieur Blaine I do n't ask you to explain anything
Everything in order
No It 's all arranged
But we made a deal
I brought the money Monsieur Blaine
Monsieur Blaine I do n't know how to thank you
You love her that much
You seem to know all about my destiny
Yes I get the point
What of it Then it 'll be out of it 's misery
Do n't you sometimes wonder if it 's worth all this I mean what you 're fighting for
Had a close one eh
Well this might come in handy
I said ask your wife
There is I suggest that you ask your wife
My friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
I appreciate it but I do n't accept it
Yes I found that a very expensive hobby too But then I never was much of a businessman
What of it
I 'm not interested in politics The problems of the world are not in my department I 'm a saloon keeper
Right
Well is n't there some other place It 's rather confidential what I have to say
Monsieur Blaine I wonder if I could talk to you
Good evening You see here we are again
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table
Any time
Not at all
We all try You succeed
Your work
And I congratulate you
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere
How do you do
Are you quite finished with us
Nothing important but may I speak to him now
Yes
Thank you
I was in a German concentration camp for a year That 's honor enough for a lifetime
Well perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca
Thank you
May we proceed with the business
I slept very well
Goodnight
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect 's office
Ilsa I do n't wish to be the one to say it but it 's late
This is a very interesting cafe I congratulate you
No Two champagne cocktails please
Very well
No Please Monsieur it is a little game we play They put it on the bill I tear the bill up It is very convenient
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca That was a gross understatement
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor
I am Captain Renault Prefect of Police
Monsieur Laszlo is it not
For the time being
Herr Laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand But in one respect you are mistaken You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced but there is one exception No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
If I did n't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal I certainly wo n't give them to you now
Yes even in Berlin If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris in Prague in Brussels in Amsterdam in Oslo in Belgrade in Athens
Do n't be in such a hurry You have all the time in the world You may be in Casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow on one condition
Not at all Captain Renault 's signature is necessary on every exit visa Captain would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa
Very well Herr Laszlo we will not mince words You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us You have reached Casablanca It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca
Then we shall state another time and another place Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect 's office with Mademoiselle
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil
You were a Czechoslovakian Now you are a subject of the German Reich
Ask Monsieur Rick
Victor Laszlo is on that plane
Find one
Yes much too good a time The place is to be closed
You see what I mean If Laszlo 's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on I advise that this place be shut up at once
Uh huh I have been thinking It is too dangerous if we let him go It may be too dangerous if we let him stay
We are concerned about more than Casablanca We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader
I have no conviction if that 's what you mean I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy
My dear Major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we can not regulate the feelings of our people
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
But we must n't underestimate American blundering I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918
If Rick has the letters he 's much too smart to let you find them there
Mademoiselle
Perhaps
I admit he is very clever Three times he slipped through our fingers In Paris he continued his activities We intend not to let it happen again
You were n't always so carefully neutral We have a complete dossier on you
How about New York
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions Unofficially of course
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others
Rick this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich
Especially so tonight Major In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26 a good French wine
Thank you It is a pleasure to have you here Major
Good evening gentlemen
Oh there is no hurry Tonight he 'll be at Rick 's Everybody comes to Rick 's
By the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
Oh we Germans must get used to all climates from Russia to the Sahara But perhaps you were not referring to the weather
Major Strasser my aide Lieutenant Casselle
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca
Uh huh
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while There 's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville I could be induced to arrange a passage
Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
As soon as the plane goes Louis
Anyway thanks for helping me out
Stay where you are I do n't know what you 're talking about
And the names are Mr and Mrs Victor Laszlo
If you do n't mind you fill in the names That will make it even more official
Just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them And remember this gun 's pointed right at your heart
I do We 've got plenty of time to discuss that later
Put that gun down
Have you taken leave of your senses
Serves me right for not being musical
Tell me when we searched the place where were they
Is everything ready
You know this place will never be the same without you Ricky
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs
You 're late
Oh thanks
I 'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor 's pen
Well she is n't just any woman
I 'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and that 'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest You get him and we get away To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance
It certainly would Germany Vichy would be very grateful
You did n't come here to tell me this You have the letters of transit You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo
What friend
Huh
Do n't count too much on my friendship Ricky In this matter I 'm powerless Besides I might lose ten thousand francs
Because one you 've bet ten thousand francs he 'd escape Two you have the letters of transit now do n't bother to deny it And well you might do it simply because you do n't like Strasser 's looks As a matter of fact I do n't like him either
Ricky I 'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo If by any chance you were to help him escape
I am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
Well I forgive you this time But I 'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it will make me very happy if she loses Uh huh
Why do you interfere with my little romances
As I suspected you 're a rank sentimentalist
So Yvonne 's gone over to the enemy
Well it looks like you 're a little late
Louis are you pro-Vichy or Free French
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon We just barely got cleaned up in time to open
Another precedent gone This has been a very interesting evening I 'll call you a cab Gasoline rationing time of night
Thanks I will
Hello Ilsa
I was born in New York City if that 'll help you any
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich
Excuse me
Oh I see Gestapo spank
Maybe Well it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here
And got well paid for it on both occasions
Because my dear Ricky I suspect that under that cynical shell you 're at heart a sentimentalist
It does n't matter There is no exit visa for him
I think not I have seen the lady And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or in Oran he certainly wo n't leave her in Casablanca
He is traveling with a lady
Done No matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or I should say two
Make it ten I am only a poor corrupt official
Is that a serious offer
This is the end of the chase
Oh but I just told you
Manages what
It is my duty to see that he does n't impress the other half Rick Laszlo must never reach America He stays in Casablanca
Rick that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed
Victor Laszlo
That is another reason There is a man who 's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa
Thank you Rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one That is the reason we permit you to remain open
How observant you are As a matter of fact I wanted to give you a word of advice
I see And what 's Strasser doing here He certainly did n't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
You know Rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here It will amuse your customers
I stick my neck out for nobody
This is no ordinary arrest A murderer no less
Rick there 's going to be some excitement here tonight We are going to make an arrest in your cafe
I was misinformed
My health I came to Casablanca for the waters
It was a combination of all three
Why What 's in Lisbon
When it comes to women you 're a true democrat
How extravagant you are throwing away women like that Someday they may be scarce
Take your hands off me
Sacha call a cab
Do n't listen to him Sacha Fill it up
Give me another
Will I see you tonight
Where were you last night
Get me the Radio Tower
Hello
I would advise you not to interfere
You 'll excuse me gentlemen Your business is politics Mine is running a saloon
Not particularly I understand the point of view of the hound too
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
Are my eyes really brown
Aha Who do you think will win the war
It 's not particularly my beloved Paris
There seems to be no secret about that
I 'm a drunkard
Make it official if you like
Do n't be a fool You ca n't get away
Do n't be afraid of that Please keep them for me Thank you I knew I could trust you
Perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
One moment Tonight I 'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of and then addio Casablanca You know Rick I have many friends in Casablanca but somehow just because you despise me you 're the only one I trust Will you keep these for me Please
Who did you bribe for your visa Renault or yourself
I do n't mind a parasite I object to a cut-rate one
For a price Ugarte for a price
If I gave you any thought I probably would
No
You are a very cynical person Rick if you 'll forgive me for saying so
May I Too bad about those two German couriers was n't it
Oh nothing But when you first came to Casablanca I thought
Huh You know Rick watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank one would think you 'd been doing this all your life
Uh excuse me please Hello Rick
Where is she Have you seen her
And getting closer every minute Here Drink up We 'll never finish the other three
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied does n't it Mr Richard
If she can stand it I can Play it
You played it for her and you can play it for me
Well stop it You know what I want to hear
What 's that you 're playing
Uh my watch stopped
Yeah boss
No sir I 'm staying right here
We 'll take the car and drive all night We 'll get drunk We 'll go fishing and stay away until she 's gone
Please boss let 's go Ai n't nothing but trouble for you here
Boss let 's get out of here
No Not me boss
Well I ai n't sleepy either
You ever going to bed
Ai n't you planning on going to bed in the near future
Boss ai n't you going to bed
Boss
Yeah but I ai n't got time to spend the money I make here
I like it fine here
The failures they remember It 's the successes they forget
Worse than Warsaw
So how are we going to get this place shaped up
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St Petersburg a distance of nine thousand miles And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St Petersburg to here a distance of what
You ca n't make it
It matters We do the best we can that 's all we have
Let 's get a second opinion Wilson What do you see
It 's real
Jesus
What 's so damn funny
It 's a fucking soccer ball you idiot
I float You sink End of story
They 're always on autopilot Or else it 's night or you 're in the sun or you 're in the trough of a wave They 'll never see you
They 're never going to see you You 're just another piece of trash in the ocean
What are you smiling about They 'll be back
You know Wilson every now and then we should say thank you Thank you God
Grow up stop being such a baby Other people get through a lot worse
Die tomorrow or die today
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you wo n't move
The sea is lovely dark and deep
Look just slip off the raft The ocean would feel so good the water 's so soft and warm Take a little swim Sleep
I 'm lost Goodbye
Why do they have to die for me
Ca n't kill another one Ca n't Ca n't kill my friends anymore
You idiot if he dives he 'll capsize the raft
Water water water
Get water
You 're putting off the inevitable
You do n't know where you are You missed the shipping lanes
Survive today that 's the point
Wilson do you believe this Take the damn water
Take it damn it
Take it
Going to die anyway
Do too much I 'll die
No water no work
Thirsty
Ca n't Need water
Feels so good to lie here
With what There 's nothing to fix it with This rope comes undone you 're going to drown

I checked the weather you had the jet stream you could have made it up
You what

San Francisco And you
Permission granted
I just hope he wo n't expect us to say Grace all the time
I suppose it would n't hurt to meet him What 's his name again
Wilbur he picked them for us himself
We all know who trained Homer his credentials are as good as mine are Do n't you be holy to me about the law What has the law done for any of us here
Do n't you understand The board is going to replace me That 's what the new blood is for
An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in South End Branch For his age he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon he is also experienced in pediatric care
One has to be more than careful of Mrs Goodhall she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country I 'd like to give her a little ether
He is a goddamn psychiatrist of course he wants to help He 'd be happy if he could help commit me
He 's still a boy out in the world he 's still a boy
Let him try to make some money That 's part of seeing the world is n't it
Some new things would be useful I do n't need any new help
They want to replace me The Board of Trustees wants to replace me
You were You are It was fantastic
I was
I was dreaming about you How beautiful you were
Wilbur the adopting couple is waiting in your office
It 's not ergot it 's not pituitary extract it 's not oil of rue
Only if you can afford it
What 's she so emotional about
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone
Homer you know I would never kill anyone you know I would n't
Better than I can
You cook very well
What for Buster What would you do if you met them
Whoever they were they did n't do any of the things parents are supposed to do Dr Larch did those things and Nurse Edna and Nurse Angela
I know who you mean I think about leaving here but not to find them
I 'm sorry Homer
But you 've studied with the old man for years
You're a doctor Homer you do n't smell like ether
He smells like he could put you to sleep
He sniffs that ether I 've seen him do it
Should n't we tell Homer
Why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him
What are you going to tell the little ones
What 'd she die of
Good night kids Do n't catch cold it 's gettin cold already
How about him not needin the friggin compass How about that
It 's gettin late I think I 'll pack it in
He mentions Homer too you know
I was lookin for Wally 's letter I was gon na show it to Homer They made him a captain already Captain Worthington
No You warned me I did n't listen but you warned me
I 'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you It was unnecessary
Sure Thanks
She knows how to take care of herself
You say that as though it 's some awful thing I never stopped loving Wally
Please do n't
Please that 's enough I loved you too you know I did
No that 's not it I just want to be sure I understand you
What do you want me to do
He 's paralyzed
For God 's sake Homer Wally 's been shot down
Stop it Just cut it out
If you 're trying to be funny Homer
Please do n't move do n't go anywhere
I know Is that nothing
Is n't that like waiting and seeing
Just tell me I 'll do whatever you want to do
Wait wait Are you sure
Mr Rose knows
Well we ca n't force her It 's her decision
Well we have to help her
We should take her to St Cloud 's That much is obvious is n't it Let her make up her mind when she gets there
Okay okay I know you do too
Fine That 's all there is to it then
So we should wait and see For how long
I 'm just waiting and seeing Like you said
We have to wait and see I think that for everything in life you have to wait and see
It will be okay
Right
Nobody will swim here until next summer By then the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand there wo n't be any sharp edges
Not with the right girl you would n't
You just cuddle You come to hug to kiss You do n't come here to watch the movie
The speaker For the movie sound
Sometimes movies mostly bore Wally
Privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies
I never asked for any responsibility
I miss things I miss people I miss reading to the boys
I did n't say that Growing up in an orphanage you 're always lonely You 're just never alone
It was my favorite night at the orphanage movie night We 'd race into the dining hall Of course everyone wanted to sit in front so we 'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing
Yes and no When you come here you do n't really care about the movie
You think Maybe I was I love this place
Well she was in a weakened condition I do n't know What about King Kong Is that medically possible
Oh sure
And what did she die of exactly
First she loved him then she did n't then no one else could have him
But you looked as if you liked it
You 've seen only one movie Which one
When they watched at all Do you like movies
Yes But it 's closed all the time now because of the blackout
I do n't think Mr Rose would leave without you
Okay
When I 'm not thinking about Wally I 'm not good at being alone Oh goodness You meant yes I 'm fine I I do n't suppose you 've seen a lobster yet
I 'm never bored It 's all very different for me here
Sure I 'll see you around
It should taper off tomorrow but it can come back again You have cramps They 'll ease up almost entirely As long as the bleeding is n't heavy it 's normal
I understand
Oh
Where 's Mandalay
I know
Really
No but I work there I like it My dad 's a lobsterman

ROSE No It ai n't Muddy Muddy 's just
Why
I know where you can go Homer and I can take you
ROSE You ai n't been through what I been through Candy
ROSE I do n't need no more clothes thank you
ROSE Hi
Oh he 's fine I just heard from him He 's bombing all these places
Homer liked it Did n't you
He loved it Did n't you
I know what you 've been doing
I love you too See you tomorrow
Well picking them is It 's about as exciting as walking
Well they are n't
I never said they were boring
No keep it down I want to feel the air
I 'm okay I can walk
So many children Are they all orphans
You mean somebody asked
Nobody 's asked for me have they
Dr Larch would n't let just anyone take any of us
Nobody ever wants me
I thought they might take me
Edna Come dance with me Let 's be foolish tonight
I would n't worry Edna that he does n't have money If he gets hungry he can pick his dinner
Or that he ca n't be bothered to write us a proper letter A dissertation on apples we do n't need
So here is my candidate What do you think
You mean they 'll replace you with someone who wo n't perform abortions
Homer was born here in what was it 1922
He 's leaving
You bet it 's a heavy sedation The fetus is unexpelled her uterus is punctured she has acute peritonitis and there 's a foreign object I think it 's a crochet hook
How old are you dear Thirteen
Someone not from Maine
No She was an immigrant
She looks after other people 's children
She 's dead now too She was a nanny
Barely It hardly mattered that I knew him
Alcohol killed him he drank himself to death
Cirrhosis it 's a disease of the liver
Why ca n't we have pumpkins for Christmas too We do n't get any good presents at Christmas anyway
Is that soon
His father 's dead right
That 's why Kong loves her
Homer does n't King Kong think the woman is his mother
No you did it yourself Maybe in your sleep
It looks like you bit it it 'll be all right
Did you bite it
Well sure that 's good then All I mean is I 'm lucky I met you
Uh actually picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while I 'm grateful for the job
The trees are flak antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground
It 's almost like flying
Migrants
Oh I would love that Wally
Actually I volunteered
I 've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet that 's the first mountain pass
And over the Himalayas That 's called flying over the hump
It 's all very normal
This is all normal Do n't worry The abortion procedure it affects you It 's the ether too It 'll take a little time
No I 'm not I need a job
I think I 'd probably like the apple business
Where are you going
I wonder if you might give me a ride
Has anyone offered you anything to eat
Really Is it serious
Have you enlisted
A B-24 Liberator
Ah well okay Good I just wondered
So now uh you 're not I mean do you do the
I 'm sorry They 're not used to seeing a car like this
ROSE Let me hear you say that I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself that what happen here ai n't that right
There 's more than one laceration more than one cut
Where 'd she get you
Okay Then you can be of use
ROSE When it comes to this you is the real thing is that what you sayin
ROSE There ai n't no almost about this stuff Homer ai n't that right
ROSE What 's that What 's it called
ROSE What business is you in Homer
Please listen to me Both of you
But she 's your daughter
ROSE Homer do n't you know what business you in You do n't wan na go into no business with me Homer ai n't that right
ROSE Ai n't nobody havin sex with my little girl Homer that 's somethin a father knows
ROSE I think you been stayin up too late at night Homer
ROSE I did n't see where you was pickin this mornin Homer but you musta worked up a big appetite You look like you 're serious about gettin to your lunch today
This is easy I 'm not hurrying
ROSE Of course there 's worms Homer And what is them worms really They just protein them worms They is good for you
ROSE Cider do n't have no taste till later in October it 's too watery now when we 're usin just them early Macs and them Gravensteins You do n't get no good cider till you 're pickin them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas them Baldwins and them Russerts
Are we supposed to be up here The rules said
ROSE That 's better I can tell you got yourself some education Them 's good hands you got Homer Them hands you got they know what they 're doin ai n't that right
ROSE Stop it Homer They are n't our rules We did n't write them I do n't see no reason to read them
ROSE It 's big enough to keep you out of the war I suppose Ai n't that right
So What should I do now
I am not a doctor
I do n't need this I know all about my condition
You know I 'm grateful for everything you 've done for me
Of course
I was n't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless I expect I 'll find some ways to be of use
Happy to be alive under any circumstances is that your point
Try to look at it this way What choice does Buster have What are his options Nobody will ever adopt him
It 's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
I thought it was my turn
I thought you took care of this It always breaks in the same place It 's your splice is n't it
Okay he 's just a Wilbur then
Henceforth you shall be Little Wilbur
I do n't think so
He does n't like it He 's a boy That 's why
Nobody 's named this one yet
When doesn't he have bronchitis I would n't call his bronchial infections underdeveloped Would you
I have n't either But you will The morons who write the books should do a little research here
Fuzzy is not uncommon I tell you there 's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along
In other words scurvy
I do n't know it
Obviously
Scurvy Ah yes the curse of the old time sailor suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables Homer Dorothy is n't a sailor
No The fetus was dead Her uterus was virtually disintegrating my stitches pulled right through the tissue
What else could I have showed you Homer The only thing I can teach you is what I know In every life you 've got to be of use
You know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they ca n't get help anywhere else
I presume you 'd prefer handling the delivery
First pregnancy
Good-bye Arthur Homer I 'll see you tomorrow
Uh sure
I think Wally will be fine Mrs Worthington he seems indestructible to me
Mrs Worthington I feel I 'm very lucky to be here
Yeah well you could move on with us man You could move on somewhere warm
Two Please do n't go up to the roof to eat your lunch
One Please do n't smoke in bed
How long 's this been going on Muddy
ROSE It means nothin at all And all this time I been wonderin about it
ROSE That 's it
ROSE Why do n't you just go back to your pickin Homer I can take care of it myself
What I mean is if you do n't want to keep the baby I know a place where you can go
ROSE Happy What are you thinkin How am I supposed to take care of a baby I ca n't have a baby
ROSE Do n't trouble yourself about it Homer this ai n't your business
ROSE Not yet What do you know about it
I do n't like watching anyone be sick
You okay Rose
ROSE Oh I suppose you is a doctor Homer
ROSE Yeah you is I know when people is in trouble and you is
No trouble
ROSE I ca n't read Nobody taught me
Yes so what It 's nothing serious really Just a small defect
There 's a little something wrong with it Just this part here the right ventricle It 's slightly enlarged
It 's just my heart
ROSE Pretty ai n't it You a plumber
ROSE What business is you in Jack Just tell me what your business is
ROSE It 's not that hard to find it in there Jack it 'll take you just a minute You just got ta go fishin
ROSE That just ai n't right Jack your cigarette 's gon na end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider That ai n't right
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons
Shit We do n't know what he is
Who cares
GOODHALL I fail to see how a little Christianity could hurt anyone here
GOODHALL You ca n't think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is
GOODHALL I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here
GOODHALL Do you know him
When will he be home Major
WINSLOW It 's encephalitis B He 's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital Ceylon Uh Captain Worthington is paralyzed Waist down He wo n't walk
WINSLOW Because the crew thought he 'd gone down with the plane They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India It was n't until that they sorted through their gear
WINSLOW When the plane was hit the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together The copilot jumped third All on Captain Worthington 's orders the captain was still flying the plane None of the men of the ground could see the sky that 's how thick the jungle was They never saw the plane crash they never heard it crash They never saw Captain Worthington 's parachute either
They 're outrageous them rules
They ai n't drops I picked 'em off the tree
ROSE What have you two been doin to make it look so nice
ROSE Do n't this place look like home
ROSE You all take care of yourself too Homer
ROSE Mind your own business Peaches
They told Muddy his feet was too flat
ROSE That 's right I know you understand how I feel Homer you is breakin them rules too Ai n't that right
ROSE That 's right A girl 's got ta know how to defend herself do n't she
ROSE She 's good with that knife She 's real fast She 's a lot better with that knife than you is Muddy And who do you suppose taught her
I told him that you all is sick
It 's that Vernon he keeps askin where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at
ROSE Do n't let us make you nervous or nothin we know you got ta job to do
What view
ROSE Where 's your manners Make room for Homer so 's he can enjoy the view
ROSE You just go inside Homer We do n't need no help
ROSE You ai n't goin nowhere in the middle of the night girl
ROSE Where do you think you 're going
ROSE Now now Jack that just ai n't right
ROSE Yeah you really showed him Daddy you just about cut your own hand off and all you cut off him was his clothes
ROSE We should drown that damn Jack in the vat
ROSE That sounds like you is in trouble already Homer
ROSE You lucky you in your work boots tonight girl
He ai n't never been outta Maine
She took off on the bicycle man
Rose Rose has runned away
The good news Jack is you 're half undressed for swimmin
She 's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen I do n't know if she 's the nicest
You 're welcome I was just going to ask you if you 'd like to join us
Really Wish we had met eight hours ago
Do n't tell me you started a tech firm here before us
So we 've been meeting with banks all day It 's amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word
Can
Silicon Valley
So what do you do
My name 's Grant Grant Ashby
Brutal day They say the streets are lined with money down here but I guess you have to know the secret handshake What are you drinking
Thanks for playing along I just have to sit for a while
But I 'm not that late You did n't have to give away my seat
Same thing with playing a con You have to be able to see that deep
Ten percent Of how much
Then there it is Ashby gets the itch
You 're worried about recouping the loan I already told you
You need some convincing Consider it a convincer
There 'll be red flags
This has to happen fast
We had to finalize the deal
And you have this letter of intent
Sort of like a letter of intent
Big.Com That Internet thing
I do n't follow
Banks need to know how they 're going to get their money back
That 's right And tech firms They 'tend to scare people off
Well typically speaking they 're not As long as you can demonstrate
Here 's where a little research comes in handy Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars It 's a small lie but now we 're sure he 's playing
What do you do over at your bank Grant
Uh right And that was it That 's when we decided to start our own business No more shithead bosses
It can erase all those things about you that you wish did n't exist
What are you talking about You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do We got it down cold Al You do n't want to jinx it by changing something up do you
Gordo plays the inside You 're the Shill
So why do n't you take a deep breath Jake and I 'll count to ten One Two Three
Like putting on a play Guess some people forgot their lines
Oh Jake You disappoint me And you just let Lily here down again What was it you said about playing the big con
Alright Turn around She does n't get shit unless I get that money Where is it
Alrlght alrlght What happened today
After you cut her loose
Yes it is Jake Yes it is They were right there for you She was right there for you Look at her
BULLSHIT You were scared Jake You lost your nerve You lost your confidence You were n't being noble You were n't trying to save anybody but yourself Admit it
So much for honor among thieves You would have cut loose your friends your girl
Is that what it was Jake Was it love
She had you tempting fate
Like what
You 're a superstitious fucker
Thanks Did you know you should n't light three cigarettes with a match
Nice
He 's just as crooked as the next guy You 'd think he 'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars
But there were other factors
I can see why you liked her
So how 'd you get caught
So you want to know how to play the Big Con
You never know when you can use a crooked cop
And these cops What do they get
Is n't it always
We ca n't all be model citizens such as yourself
That 's not a bad place to start
Your life flashing before your eyes
Things are probably going to end badly for you Jake
The Anti-Christ
And I think it 's because of this redhead
Ten is standard sir
We 'll take care of it
So we go to the bar
Not that I recall What do you want us to do about it
Poor bastard never knew what hit him Jesus I almost felt sorry for the guy
The red hair It 's bad luck
This might just be me but that is hands down the dumbest fucking idea I 've ever heard
Fuck that We 're going too
Whoa What
We sure Big Al threw him to us
No that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said Except anybody that 's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he 's comfortable doing alone is eating This guys tells this guy that guy tells some other guy eventually it works it 's way back to someone who works for the King and
What are you New Let me tell you how good this guy is Last night Al calls this bookie to settle up Apparently he 's been ducking him for like a month So the guy asks him where he 's got all this money all of a sudden right What does Al do Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond Does he tell him he 's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop No He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type How HE fleeced
Independent Same shit just independent They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book Big Fat Bald
Currently the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday 'Cept this time he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King 's money back before any body says boo
Jake I mean come on
So what We just stay clear of him
Let 's go Jake
It 's alright Grant 's one of the good guys
So far masters of our own demise What bank are you with
What No Use the bathroom on the plane
I 'd like this cashed please
That 's it
What do I always tell you guys Do n't spend it all Sooner or later we 're going to run into some bad luck Save some Put it away so when shit like this happens you 're not desperate That 's it The gig 's up
We 'll use the Euc
Eight A.M flight
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow
You sure
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director 's office and says The code 's fine the program 's for shit and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk
She 's up for it
Here 's what 's going to happen Gordo we need to find a guy in Gillette 's bank Miles we need papers corporate insurance
No not whatever You 're either in or you 're out
We pay better
We meet him with corporate papers inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital The corporate papers are in order but we need things to happen fast Our guy fudges numbers in the right places moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom depending upon what we need
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty
How much we going after
You got ta be kidding me Her
When
And what about Big Al
It gets worse Now I know why he was such a good rope I mean cash That much and we never had to put him on the Send Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night They just pulled him out of the East River
It can buy you a new and better you
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead Did you see how fast he ran out of here It 's done He 's not coming back
What I can feel you looking at me
I told you use less powder
PIN Harder Remember I killed your buddy
PIN Come on Harder
No thanks I 'm good
You 're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything are you
PIN I said take off your fucking shirt
No you listen We 're partners now and even though I 'm running the show for you I 'm still running the show That means I get a little respect So I do n't want to hear anymore of this Scooter Buddy Junior Skippy Tiger bullshit It 's Jake And I got ta tell you for a guy who spends all his time in a gym you could be in better shape
PIN Hey Skippy Do I have the word chump tattooed on my forehead
PIN That 's more than you already owe me What happens if you fuck this up
PIN Stake you
PIN What do you need from me Permission Go If you can fleece him for two million then do it Kid
PIN How much
Why
PIN I ll be honest with you Kid A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me First thing I have to ask myself is is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me You tried it once
PIN Fucking grifters I love it You got balls I 'll give you that much
PIN Buddy that was business Besides you have more crew Then there 's you
PIN Let me repeat Why not
PIN Why not
PIN Honest mistake Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven
PIN You ca n't cheat an honest man But a man like Lionel Dolby
PIN Of course your line of work 's only as good as the people you find
PIN You know back in the day grafting was considered a gentleman 's racket Good suits good food The Underworld of the Underworld A grifter had to survive on his wits his instincts I like that I like the idea of that These days things being what they are guys like me got ta stay low It 's all take take take You ca n't just be fucking witty about it
PIN Minus one
PIN Here and there Scooter Here and there like Boston Chicago Houston The bay area Some action in London 'til it turned nickel and dime Or how about that little stint down in Miami Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there You guy 's pretty good
PIN Grifter huh Where have you been on the grift Could n't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you Skippy
Kennedy International terminal Gordo with a black suitcase You got Moonan under control

Lily Jesus Christ
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off He said he was going to fuck some sense into me
Sort of I was telling him about this great love of my life who 's name I do n't remember and I could see He was getting pissed I thought it was just because he was worried about me but He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend did n't really love me
No we never got busted We were done with a shift one night both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend about how we were thinking about doing it you know I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him What the hell was his name
We were friends I trusted him I should have known it was weird But then again I was weird
He was n't my boyfriend I had a boyfriend at the time What was his name Anyway Glenn was like thirty I was only fifteen But he was a nice guy Real sweet Liked to talk We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that
Not the way I did it I was loaded half the time I do n't know how you could change bedpans sober I used to hang out with this guy Glenn He was an x-ray technician or something
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole I actually did have a real job once When I was in high school I worked as a candy striper
WHAT
Do n't ruin this for me
Intuition
No You have another part You 'll know what to do
Intuition It does n't make you Yoda Like tonight You killed that guy tonight But I knew you would
I 'm good at it Lying cheating manipulating I 'm good at it
Good quality porn has it 's place in the world
Not in that repressed anger sort of way
Are you asking me if I have something to prove
It 's what I do It 's my job
For what A couple hundred bucks
Off the record I 'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it 'd help
Did I miss something
You told me to change my hair

What about Customs
What do I have to do
No What 's my cut

Jake Customs
And we got rid of the red head
Do you even remember Al Do you remember what he looked like sitting there
No no no Not this time I am doing this for your own good You guys have got to learn when to stop You with the Armani You with the hookers

So this is our boss right He chases me and Miles out of his office and he 's yelling and screaming You 're fired Your whole team 's fired He starts looking for Lily Lupus Gordo
But if you wan na talk about bad luck
Him
What you 're looking for in a mark is someone who 's weakness you can exploit
Is it all fugasi
Yeah well we 're still a little young for Albany State Prison Are you pissed about Al I 'm pissed too but I 'm not like twenty-five to life pissed
What are you talking about Yes we have And we would have been beautiful about it We would 've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on
We never had a problem with that before
Yeah or D it 's a dumb fucking idea
Good point
What
Because that 's who the King Pin wants us to fleece And Gillette 's perfect
Breasts
No Big con One rag One rag and we get out from under all this But we need another Shill
We 're working for the King
You better hurry The police will be here any second I do n't really understand my motivation with this Why am I washing glasses
How do you know the King 's going to let you walk
Just mail it to the hospital Mr King please It 's regarding an accounting problem Yes Correct I know where it is That will be fine Thank you

Let me ask you something You really think I 'm going to come this close this fucking close and let my guard down I 'll get square with your boss I 'll get square with whoever did Al I 'll get square with everybody Then I 'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here
Oh you know Do n't fuck this up I 'll kill you I 'll kill your family I 'll shoot your dog All the usual Then he said good luck
Point is you do n't go through with this he 's going to go after you next And he do n't even like you Jake
Your buddy That fat guy The King could n't wait to have that guy whacked He did n't even know who the guy was but he was so pissed off at him he gets him drilled It ai n't personal It 's business
Exactly 'Cept this Gillette guy He gets to walk around in three piece suits hob knob with the Mayor own a bank that kinda shit Meanwhile the King sits holed up in the steam afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door
What I 'm saying is is that the King ai n't gon na care See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy If you ask me I think he 's jealous
King ai n't gon na like this
You going to have the time
Okay Here 's the thing You fall flat you might not get anything short of stiffed Then it 's Blue River Land for everybody Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply then they start to take shape Usually it 's the shape of an arrow I hate to do it but after this I got ta give you the blowoff We Jake Jake
Still time
I want to get out from under all this for good And I want to fuck them all doing it
It 's not history
I can handle it
The King
Ca n't say
Hey I been on the ramp all my life so I got no problem with the way you help yourself Jake
Try and keep up You ask for the Advantage Goods then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps So I got ta think you 're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob
Can I speak to you in confidence
In over your head
Not easy pickin 's Papers like these speak to larger issues Sorry about Alfonse You into something big
What are we gon na do with this stuff anyway Heroin What the hell do you do with heroin
I try
We got a good thing going here You want to blow it over an overbite
Confidence It 's just confidence
Ten percent
I got it figured out He 's got this thing with bathrooms If he makes it through Customs he 'll be heading for the john
He 's landing He 's got a suitcase on wheels
I do n't think so Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake 's got a plan that 'll probably keep him off
Coupla things They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split
What
You guys awake
I think so What 'd he ever do to you anyway
Look I 'm not a confrontational person by nature
I want him for something big and to do that we have to catch him in the act
Look Special Agent Moonan We do n't know what you 're talking about
You are Officer Richard Rottovich And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski I 'm looking for Jake Vig
Roger that
You guy 's are not working with me here I just got off the phone with my boss After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole he let me know exactly how little I 'm welcome back if we come up short And now here you guys are WASTING MY FUCKING TIME
Good I got ta go So what do you have for me
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick
That 's it
What do you get out of it
What do you want
I 've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now Problem is the guy 's the invisible man A spook a spectre a ghost Then like a gift Jake 's good buddy and member of his crew Alfonse Moorely is found the other day with a hole in his head
Put your hand down I do n't high five
What are you doing
That 's what I 'm talking about
I do n't trust anybody You see how bad this guy wants Vig It 's like a sickness I say we collar Vig ourselves We got Vig then we got leverage And we trade Vig for that tape I want to see it right in front of my face
Whoa whoa There he is
It 's cosmetic They do n't cover cosmetic Last year I had a tooth capped The dentist tells me I 'm not covered for caps It 's cosmetic
What 's he going to do File a missing drugs report If it works out this guy might be good for a few more turns
Do n't be an idiot How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer 's drugs to another drug dealer If Vig 's right we might be looking at a hundred maybe a hundred fifty grand
You sell it
What are you laughing at Who was that on the phone

I do n't know anything about it
What are you talking about

Look now I 'm pumping you I 'm sorry It 's none of my business It 's just that you 're not like the others
Ah we all say that But if we hate it why do we do it
I 've been watching you work You 're the best in the place But you know that
You called the casino a cesspit
I can imagine
Why did you quit
All men are cheats
It 's the tension
Goodnight
Maybe another time
No Thanks

I hate public transport
You 're already alone
Here use a spoon
Then what
Marion What did you tell the police
There was a message was n't there
I thought you would n't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here
Gambling 's about not facing reality Ignoring the odds
Gambling 's not about money
Never Why do you ask
Not talking Writing
What
You will
It 's none of my business what you write And your job that 's none of my business either I love you And I 've done everything wrong
I do n't care about her Of course I was angry But not with you The book is yours not mine I was wrong what I said about it I hurt you did n't I
It will
It 's beautiful Thank you
Leave it
Crap It 's not relative It 's unfair Like your casino It 's designed unfair And your croupier 's a little shit because he goes along with it
Without hope there 's no point to anything
Oh really Then why is he called Jake Why do n't you come clean and call him Jack There 's no hope in it
I do n't give a fuck about the sex Most men 'll fuck a lamppost He 's just a miserable zombie Is that the way you feel now Is that what 's happened to you
Is that your idea of a winner He does n't give a shit about anyone He uses people and
I do n't like it at all You had a wonderful character before the Gambler He was so romantic
I do n't like it
I 'm on at nine
What about a drink on the way home
Have n't you got a conscience of your own
What do I mean to you I want to know Tell me
Well that 's my poor upbringing I did n't go to no private school I have n't got no class I want to live with a writer Not a fucking croupier I do n't even know what the word means Croupier
This fucking job 's getting to you You have n't written a fucking word since you started
Are you drunk
Take that back Fucking take that back I 'm not a cop any more
Where 've you been I 've got to give evidence in court at nine
When you get home I 'm asleep When I leave home you 're asleep
I loved it blond
Tension It 'll go
Fine
I do n't know
You 've got such beautiful hands
I love you Jack you know that
You sold the car You got a job What 's the third thing Tell me
You were a croupier there You never told me that I thought you just knew some gamblers
450 What did you do just walked in and said I want to be a croupier Do n't you need training
How did you land that
What job
I want to hear it
You 're my prisoner
Come on Marion Let 's face the truth Nobody 's going to publish it
I owe you for the rent It 's only a car I can get another
I sold the car
Turn around
You really are a beautiful woman
You want me drunk
You mean I wo n't resist them
I wo n't Goodbye dad
Yes I know that
So how are you doing dad
SR For Christ 's sake Jacko do n't look a gift horse in the mouth Have you written that name down Reynolds at the Golden Lion
It 's not that
SR Well I 've got something for you In London I mean I 've been chatting to some friends Do you know the Golden Lion casino It 's in Bayswater I believe They 're looking for a dealer a croupier
SR Found a job
Yes I 'm all over that now Jack hold on a minute There 's someone here who wants to talk to you
Great I 'm getting married At least I think I am
Sun City I 've been meaning to call you for months
Jack It 's Jani
It 's a shame there are n't more men in the world like you
No thank you
I took the bandage off yesterday
I 've still got mine
That bruise has cleared up nicely
Yes
It 's all relative I need the money too
It does n't seem fair You 're offering me ten grand in cash but you ca n't afford a decent place
Yes
I have to take the car
I 'm sorry
Did they tell you to sleep with me
How much do you owe
Wait a minute
I 'm asking you as a friend You 'd be saving the life of a friend
I want to go back to Cape Town I want to start again clean
Next time it 'll be my neck
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after They want someone they can be sure of an honest dealer That 's the point Not all dealers are honest Mr Reynolds will never suspect you
You keep the ten thousand pounds
It wo n't
I 've come to know you You 're honest I trust you
You wo n't be committing a crime The man will cheat you 'll just be doing your job that 's all
You do n't have to be criminal A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat You 'll see him stop him and the guy will make a big scene There 'll be chaos And that 's when it 'll happen
Just listen You do n't have to do anything criminal
The point is they want a man inside
My creditors One night around three in the morning they 'll come into the casino
They mean it
I do n't have any money switches on the light JANI is looking distressed
Was that why you did the two grand I could n't help you
What kind of trouble
Then you 're not a pro
It can only work with amateurs A pro would have spotted it
You choose
You do n't like cheats do you
What happened
He does n't gamble
Jani there 's something I want to say Before we get there I do n't know what the sleeping arrangements are Giles probably expects us to share a room
Just an accident Nothing
I do n't gamble
Absolutely not
Absolutely not But then I 'm a Gemini and Geminis do n't believe in astrology
We all came from Africa supposedly
And superstitious too It 's like witchcraft
The debts
Your father
In the casino
I was born in the Transkei on the Wild Coast
First visit to London
So why did you come to my casino
There 's a casino in this hotel
Impossible to calculate
It 's against the rules Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters
Oh hello
I 've lived there
I 'm sorry madam we do n't accept gratuities in the UK It 's different in South Africa
You did
Who did it Tell me
Who
Turn left at the lights
Too much Eighteen hundred
I might
I 'm a witch A white witch Why do n't we move on
I 'm Lucy
You 've been avoiding me
I 'd like to buy you a drink
I 'll tell you later
Rough life Jack
Do n't worry
The world breaks everyone and afterwards many are strong in the broken places Ernest Hemingway
I 'm off I need to sleep
Do n't worry I wo n't report you
Hey Jack join us
Does Bella come here
Vodka Straight On the rocks
And the girls
Who are these guys
You 're talking about complicity
Because if a supervisor knew I 'd seen you and I had n't reported it I 'd lose my job as well And I ca n't afford that
If I see you do it again I 'll report it
I 'm not going to report it
That Greek guy who won at the end You paid him out in 25s not 20s
Look Matt there 's something I have to say to you I saw you cheating
I 'll lay you five to one you wo n't sleep In this job you have to unwind Otherwise it 'll kill you I mean that
I 'm off to a little watering hole Why do n't you join me Relax
You 've done pretty well
How long have you worked at the casino
Nice car
Thanks
Have you got transport
Where do you live Jack
Wait a minute You got yourself barred
I 'm afraid that 's not so sir
You 've won with the two chips you placed earlier but the third chip was a late bet
I 'm sorry sir that 's a late bet
Bruised
She was a real asset But what could I do
Thanks for the information
He 's paying out in stacks of 25
Does he win
All right Mr Reynolds
Jack you 're not the usual type we get here
Fine
Fine
We have tapes in here that go back six months Let me show you something
This is our Crow 's Nest I 'm showing it to you now but you 'll never see it again
She 's not in the gaming business is she
Girlfriend
How
Does know Or does report What would happen if I knew something like that and did n't report it
We had the same rule at Sun City but it was impossible to check
I do n't gamble Mr Reynolds
I do n't gamble
What for
I said good call
Good call
What makes you so sure
I make it six
How many aces are left
What happens if I want to sneeze
Wipe your hands
Have n't you forgotten something
Where 's the magnet
You use two alternating do n't you
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours
Stacks of 20 Rows of 5
Why four And not three or five
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond
Do you have a Salon Prive
I do n't think I know that one Private I suppose
Where did you go to school
In any case I understand you 've had some previous experience in South Africa You 'll find the rules a little different here Before we start you have n't got a police record have you
You 've been recommended by the management here They know your father He has a bit of a reputation has n't he
David Reynolds I 'm the Manager here Sit down John
What the hell
What was that I did n't hear
We 've got to disarm the bomb
It did n't go off
It did n't go off
Where is the key
The key goddamit the key
I do n't have it I do n't know where it is
The key
Key
Key Key What is the key
I think he 's talking to it
Look bomb
Eventual supernova
Remember when the artificial gravity went out in the toilet
I hope it 's not the oven again
Oh What 's wrong now
What flickering light
I read that with a quantum increase of seven
Right that checks out here
Talby can you read me
Talby Talby can you read me
Rechannel all safety relays
Quantum is up thirty-five
Why does n't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
Sounds good Chart a course for the Veil Nebula
So do n't give me any of that sentient life crap Find me something I can blow up
Remember what we found Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it Remember
It 's a goddamn wild goose chase Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud
Fuck that shit
Find me something I do n't care where it is
Well now what What do you have for us now Boiler
Pinback I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
19 Thanks
19 Armed
19 Check at six minutes
19 Detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
19 Energy shielding positive function
20 And I saw that I was alone
20 In the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
Bomb
Hey bomb
Hello bomb
Huh
20 No
20 I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes Detonation will occur at the programmed time
20 Thanks
20 Armed
20 Detonation in twenty minutes
20 Energy shielding positive function
20 Bomb 20 to Sergeant Pinback Roger I read you continue
You have no proof that it was correct data
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
So if you detonate in
That 's all beside the point The concepts are valid wherever they originate
Yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate
Well then you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
And you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data would you
And you can only do it once right
Now bomb consider this next question very carefully What is your one purpose in life
Why do n't you have more time
That 's it
Exactly
What I 'm getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data And this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center
20 This is fun
20 My sensory apparatus reveals it to me
20 Hmm Well I think therefore I am
20 It is intuitively obvious
20 Well of course I exist
20 I am always receptive to suggestions
20 Of course
20 I read you Lieutenant Doolittle but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes Detonation will occur at the programmed time
20 I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds Detonation will occur at the programmed time
Talby was in the air lock You blew him out of the ship I 'm going after him Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him
Hello Pinback are you there
I 'm coming in now I 'm down by the Emergency Air Lock Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in
Remark
remove thrust drive repellant
Ah negative drop
Who cares
Out where
I hereby name this star Fred
Fred
Commander Powell is dead
Who cares Do n't bother me
What
Naah All stable
Yeah Eight it says here
Another unknown Not on the charts A red dwarf
New star Hey guess what I got a new star on the readout
In a second
Yes
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen
Pinback
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction
Ah what was that again I still ca n't hear you
Ah what 'd you say Pinback
Before we get too far away and our signals start to fade I just wanted to tell you you were my favorite I really liked you Doolittle
I 'm going into them I 'm going to hit them Doolittle
It is Doolittle it 's the Phoenix They glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said
Doolittle I think it 's the Phoenix Asteroids
Guess you 're right
Looks like I 'm headed for the planet Talby Going right toward it
What happened Doolittle
Doolittle Doolittle where are you
Doolittle Help me
Not now
Sh Talby do n't bother me now
Sounds good Talby Let me know if anything important comes up
Yes Talby what is it
I wish I had my board with me now Even if I could only polish it once in awhile
Do n't worry about it We 'll find out when it goes bad
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy Hit that water Ridin the wall just perfect
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit
I ca n't talk to the others but with time to myself I think about back home back home at Malibu I used to surf a lot Talby I used to be a great surfer
It 's funny but I kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
You know what I think about Talby
Phoenix Asteroids Never heard of 'em
You 'll have plenty of time for that you know Figure it this way twenty years in space and we 've only aged three so there 'll be plenty of time to stare around
Should spend some time below see more of the rest of the ship
Must get lonely being up here so much
You know Talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us You spend too much time up here
I need a diameter approximation
TALBY
Men men what happened men
Sir
I already have sir and Pinback is talking to it now
Sir
We 're running out of time sir
Commander Are you still there
What were you saying Commander about the bomb
Sorry sir you faded out there for a minute
Commander Powell Commander hello
What should we do sir The time is running out
That 's correct sir
Negative effect
Yes sir Negative effect
You do n't understand sir we ca n't get the bomb to drop
Well sir the Dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
What 's that sir
Commander sir we have a big problem You see the Veil Nebula bomb Bomb Number 20 is stuck It wo n't drop from the bomb bay It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in less than eleven minutes
Commander Powell this is Doolittle Ah there 's something serious come up sir and I have to ask you something
How I make my living what 's your point

I 'm really glad we 're having this conversation You 're right I was angry at you But talking about it The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault Can you ever forgive me
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued causing you to maybe take offense
Theo rode for this place a long time man
Yeah well around here I 'm the Most High From now on before you do anything call in for instructions
Which is none of your business or mine
So you just decided to return it to the sender Or in this case the sender 's wife

I do n't get involved with guns
Later
I ai n't mad at you
A grand
Thought I 'd let you have first crack Later

Every week

And for all his cattin around not much of a stick man either
Yech

Hello
Like I said This is n't my regular line of work so I 'm making it up as I go
We 're not going that route Sonrisa 's not someone you make deals with
Look I 'd really like to
Your daughter 's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet
I know
Damn Are you alright
Oh my God In here IN HERE
Mommy I 'm scared
When
Mommy where are you
Then I 'm gon na do what you do to make me feel better when I 'm sad
If I 'm sad or tired or sometimes when I 'm angry or when somebody 's being mean to me
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying
Are we in some kind of trouble
But why ca n't we stay here
I do n't want to move away
Zack He made it He 's alive
And whether you want to believe it or not you already fired the first shot On another matter Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks scars tattoos I did a search and came up with this
With your help
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden Was n't s'posed to but it did And it 's back to the law of the jungle You got your predators and you got your victims
You are involved By being alive you 're involved
These girls kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder The oldest is twelve The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead
I do n't know what to say
Open it
That 's what soldiers do right
Well not me personally
You believe that
I 'm sorry
I would 've come sooner but I did n't How 're you doin
See you 're back and still rocking the boat
You 're a soldier Max That 's what you were put here for But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up
They want me bad Or at least they do n't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever Best case I wind up back in that facility More likely it 's a long drive out in the country if you know what I mean
I did n't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention
Yeah I catch your hacks He 's Satan 's lap dog or something
That 's low but this effects me how exactly
I already do n't like the sound of this
What 's in it for you
You said you could help
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people
Your basic hodge-podge
Yeah a made-up creature Like in mythology with the head of a lion the body of a goat and the tail of
I know they made me Even got the label on my neck to prove it
I remember fine I just did n't understand what was going on They never told us anything except what to do It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out
We got separated right away I never knew how many made it
Not that I do n't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me
I do n't know what kind of game you 're playing here but I 'm out because you are a whack-job
L-Triptophane a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures Then the lightbulb went off
You lost me
The other ones
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about
No I meant this
C'mere I want to show you something
I have n't been able to get you off my mind
I 'm sorry It was n't my intention But I had to see you
Look if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out
It 's alright Peter we 're fine
You 're that nervous you 're welcome to stay here
That would be appropriate yes
So saw my hands off I left you a present
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear
Bent
Me You 're the one who tried to rip off this piece
It was open
I 'm not a half bad cook
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time
Is the social studies class over for today
Personally I 'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I ca n't do anything about
So what are you gon na do about it
You miss the good ol days Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they did n't have to And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat Those good ol days
So what you just like the sound of your own voice
What 's your shot in all this Being a famous anonymous underground pirate cyber-journalist ca n't be much of a payday
Girlfriend
How does Mrs Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody 's hit list
So now you tracked me down What d'ya think
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention
How 'd you find me
Lem me get my coat
Sorry about your window
Original Cindy say hi to my good friend
So this guy walks into a bar and says
Who is
So what you liked it because it was shiny
You have good taste French 1920 's attributed to Chitarus
I 'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time
Guess it was n't the pizza delivery guy
First time I ever heard that
Girl 's got ta make a living
I 'll wait
Any idea when she 'll be back
Ca n't help you
She may be easy on the eyes but she 's trouble trust me Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme
You do n't want to
Ladies would be elsewhere
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again
Say the words I understand
Now here 's how it 's gon na be Lydia You 're gon na take your threats and your acrylic nails and you 're gon na go home and figure out your marriage instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do understand
Let go of my hand
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch I decide when I 'm done with your boyfriend Not him and certainly not you Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are
You 're also a fool
How sweet Standing by your man even after what he did You 're a very understanding person
Oh
I thought it was important for you to know the facts
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately That 's so you wo n't see the fingernail marks on his back Bet you did n't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting He did n't either at first
With me where he 's been after work three sometimes four nights a week for the last two months We have what you might call an intimate relationship
My name 's Lydia And it seems you and I have a lot in common
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late
A friend of your fiance 's
I 'm on my way
Just give it to me I 'll remember
Zero C'mon Dan I do n't have all day
Sure you wan na be havin this conversation over the phone
You and me both
Bastard
I 'm you I take that money and get outta town while you can
Hardware 's too sophisticated It 's got ta be the government And why do I think they 're looking for you
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery But there 's a bug in my computer keyboard a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture
Whoever tossed this place wants you And I 'm looking to stay outta the line of fire
I do n't know what your story is and I do n't want to
As long as you 're okay
Nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners This kind of search it 's heavy spadework I 'm gon na need
They do n't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar codes on their necks which is something I 'm not even going to ask about
Only a last name would be nice Or the nearest town to this clinic
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven whose last name you do n't even know Maybe if you could give me something more on her anything you can remember some detail
Then what That 's it That 's all I got
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine
Thank you
Who 's this guy This is n't who we 're looking for her name was Hannah
I got a hit on the car An oh-five Tahoe blue with Wyoming tags AGT349 It was n't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers
My name 's not kid It 's client As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle Now you got something for me or not
Yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin on here
You did
But of course there 's nothing self serving in that scenario
Besides think of the drama I 'm sparing Natalie
They do n't have a lot of moving parts
They 're prisoners to their genes
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes
And because he 's my friend
Yeah 'cause maybe he 's learned his lesson
It 's a secret
Got ta go
A fog bank
Because you 're probably my closest friend in the whole world
A long time
If I knew what you were saying I would n't be asking
A little what
Yeah
No
Tell me the truth Am I a female fog bank
That 's odd
CINDY You 're way more philosophical than I could ever be
CINDY Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him
Straight
CINDY No but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day know what I 'm saying
CINDY Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes So now I got ta get my wheels fixed
Okay idea Compromise right Bruno here comes with me He holds the money until mommy shows up then we close escrow What you do with her after I 'm gone does n't keep me awake nights
Can you put that in a bag or something
She 's got my word
Make the call
And she bought that
So how do you get the woman to come to me
Look you 're a player I 'm bringing you this on a plate and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business
Who are you
I actually know how this works
Quite a mouth on a girl so young but my guess is talking is not what it does best
Not right now Okay when
I 'll bet you can Sit
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow
Here 's the dealio on Eyes Only He 's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment bored stupid So he gets off on scarin the poop outta folks like you I got ta go
Do n't believe everything you hear on TV
Probably a touch of what 's going around
Playing hooky again
It 's payday need me to pick up your check
That was extreme Did you see that one guy
Okay okay okay
True but
She was the one
She 's toxic monster in bed but toxic
No I 'm serious That psycho got exactly what she deserved Yes
You rock Max You Rock
Max what did I do to deserve a friend like you
She came by the apartment once already Fortunately I 'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution Lydia 's not gon na back off until she gets her pound of flesh
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo
I just do n't want Natalie to ever find out She deserves better
But you explain that you 're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me
She tells you how I 've been
So you 're straight on how this is gon na go down
And why should she
What happens if you level with her
Fight fire with fire Threaten to go to her husband
A toy
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way
Does this person have a name
Then a sympathetic mouth then a sympathetic
And you were a sympathetic ear
Really
Here it comes The part where the guy turns everything around
You left out condescending
Or do you think we 're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we 'll look the other way which is arrogant and condescending
Do guys actually believe their lame self serving excuses
I do n't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me
You blew off your girlfriend last night even though it was the big one-oh I 'd be pissed off too if I was her
We got ta talk
But I 'll take a rain check
I got ta meet Natalie for dinner
Later
Theo 's dead
I 'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I 'm not feeling so hot
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I was n't feeling so hot
I do n't know how to break this to you Normal we 're all looking for another job
How 'bout you do n't break my sneakers on this The guy is seriously not well
He 's sick
I do n't sleep Theo asked me to pick up his check
What 's the difference if I 'm on call here or deployed in the field
I was on call
I 'm not paying you for the lovemaking Hawk I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer
Well shame on him if he does n't
And he loves you back does n't he
No I mean you love your son
You love him

Well Obviously no one you have to worry about Woody
Better ease up then Hawk Would n't want to give you whiskey dick would we
Gin
I 'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you 'd get in a position and spend some time on me
Do n't be so glum Hawk The night 's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities
You 're too kind I 'm Amanda
Look people undress in public because A they 're exhibitionists B they 're nutcases or C they need the money I can tell you 're not A and I hope to hell you 're not B So my suggestion is think about why you 're a C and let your body party shake your groove thing boogie oogie oogie till you just ca n't boogie no more
You 're not gon na chicken out on me now are you We 've got your KISS song playing and everything
Amanda Finch Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt She like 'em young And since you look a little new at this let me give you three words of advice Hard to get Think it act it know it be it Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games
Save your money stud muffin The lady at the end of the bar sends her love
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before
Yeah a man 's drink
Got any KISS
Hawk
Bye
Tell me about it Church will never be the same again
I feel like such an idiot Why did n't I just say something a year and a half ago Man think of how much time we wasted
Nah Once I get my own wheels I could come up all the time
My dad 's company is relocating him We 're moving That 's why I was acting so freaky in school today I thought it was the last time I 'd ever see you Anyway open the box I would have given it to you this morning except like I said I was freaking out
I have all your notebook doodles memorized Jam Here
Your man is the drummer Peter Criss right
So Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow 's tongue grafted onto his real one Y'know to make it so long
Right slow
You do n't know how long I 've been waiting to hear that Jam
I 've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you Jeremiah I 've just always been too scared to show it
I did n't mean for that to be so intense Forgive me
Beth I ca n't believe it
Jeremiah
Sorry
No problem
Oh God how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere
Tease What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids
So are you like gon na polish our nobs or what
What 's it worth to you
Plenty but it was all bad
For the next hour and a half it 's every dude for himself Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M we 'll meet over there

Disco blows dogs for quarters
Pizza and I been jones-in for a pizza ever since we left St Bernard 's
Let 's stop in Sandusky Hawk
I 'm starvin and it 's way past lunchtime
Just for the record I understood the last part of what you said but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever
Our band Mystery is a quartet and we ca n't go on the road without our drummer Jam 's mom said something about sending him to St Bernard 's right We got ta bust him out before we go anywhere
Stan Lee could n't think of a better one
Maybe some tunage 'll chase those blues away
For once Lex is right It 's over Things ca n't get any worse from here
What are you high
No You do n't think
I found the Volvo
Okay one of us sneaks in gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience comes back out and we all re-enter the concerto Voila
I think we should try sneaking in
Holy shit I am in absolute trouble I never should have let you drive man Absolute fuckin trouble
I mean my mom 's got insurance What 's the worst thing she could do Ground me for the entire year I can handle that
Wake up Lex This is Detroit The cops are n't gon na waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car Face it the Volvo 's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced diced and julienned by Christine the chop shop gourmet
DUDES
Uh dudes
What the fuck
Jeezis Hawk can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car
Now how are we gon na do this
Ok dudes follow my lead
Very funny Hawk Okay I 'm in on this hare-brained scheme but if anything happens to my mom 's car I 'm blaming you I 'll say you drugged me or something
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity Yeah I 'm vaguely familiar
Then lighten up She 'll never know we touched it Alright here 's the plan We bus it to chez Lex grab the Volvo bail Jam the hell outta St Bernard 's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit
And when is she due back from that groinecologist 's convention anyway
Damn straight we are
So Your mom 's car has a CB radar detector and cruise control check
Never mind with the too bad shit I got a crazy plan but only the craziest among us can pull it off
Weird
Whoa she just farted
That 's Sherry VanHafton
Second floor girls john Two minutes He 'll never look there
Yeah she gives you shit and you take it
Shit that dork is Jam
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch
Okay Ahem You Are A Dick With Ears And A Really Bad Haircut
Well let 's recap shall we You slapped all of us yelled at me used my head for a rag threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8 track under the wheels of a passing semi So if the lesson was that you 're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut then yes I 'd say we learned it
Are you gettin wise with me
Could be
Do you realize the sheer goddamn unadulterated undiluted no holds barred one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow absolutely friggin STUPIDITY of what you just did
Hey I invented fake I.D.s alright That 's not the problem They 're playing disco music in there man
Dude if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it I 'd give it my best shot I 'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time But this tribal ritualistic bullshit it 's way-too-spontaneous for me
I ca n't just walk in and take my clothes off It 's embarrasskin
The easy way
Sorry man no can do But I 'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy
We all beat each other up then once we 're nice and bruised we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen They got ta let us in then
Well I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak
But my plan involves all four of us acting together
Wait I know how we can get in
I got
I 'm sorry guys I thought it was a nice thing to do
It was stolen
Guys GUYS Come on if this is anyone 's fault it 's mine I was the one who grabbed Trip 's jacket by mistake It 's my fault and I apologize
Kind of funny I thought He 'd be pissed as hell at me
Disco Inferno Disco 's infernal morelike
Well could n't you slow down so I can at least state my case Hawk If you do n't like it you can speed up and I 'll never mention it again

Hawk
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth Lord have mercy
BRUCE Just keep your lying heathenous trap shut Jeremiah
BRUCE If you truly are sorry son then you better pray like you 've never prayed before God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it
BRUCE What
BRUCE Someday you 'll have a son just like you Jeremiah A boy who lies through his teeth buys demonic records and smokes the dope just like you
You mean you 're sending me to b b-boarding school
BRUCE You 're a smart boy Jeremiah And so handsome
BRUCE Now do n't forget you 're on the honor system tonight I 'll be home a little after one and if you 've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music well need I remind you of the consequences
BRUCE Besides those jeans are so tight I can see your penis

But we took the keys

Man that weed knocked Christine on her ass She 's sleeping like a baby stella
Eyowch This is one hot pizza
Well here we are back at fucking school again
About fuckin time if you ask me I 'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway
Simplicity Hawk
The Chinese have a proverb That which appears too good to be true usually is There 's got ta be a catch
I did it I did it We won
Oh everything 's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would you snug sonofabitch You fuckin jinxed us
Wake up Lex We just watched Jam 's mom torch our fuckin KISS tickets Not REO Speedwagon Not Journey Not the Bay City Rollers KISS If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom I 'd sure like to hear it
Waitaminit dudes I got it Maybe we can glue the tickets back together
If your mom so much as smells those tickets they 're history and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row the third year
You know what they say about a big ass big shit
What
Shrooms And even if it was LSD I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day
You 're one to talk Lex Your mom 's a fuckin dyke
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen I hope he does n't get grounded again If he misses Peter Criss 's drum solo I do n't know if he 'll be able to handle it

GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING
Good MORNING
Good morning
Did you know him
I feel bad for his family
What was his name
What happened
Hi what 's going on here
Not if you chose to stay within God 's channel
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future And that 's a form of time travel right
If God controls time then all time is pre-decided Then every living thing travels along a set path
Could these wormholes appear in nature
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach
Like a spear
MONNITOFF Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness That darkness is part of their natural development
MONNITOFF What effect do you think this would have on an infant
Like a DeLorean
So that 's it
and be able to find one of these wormholes
So in order to travel back in time you 'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light
I know that this is gon na sound kinda weird but do you know anything about time travel
Dr Monnitoff
The Last Unicorn By Samantha Darko
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this Samantha
When you fall asleep tonight I 'm gon na fart in your face
Not until like eighth grade
Our saviour
Dea ex machina
Well if you 're innocent then you have nothing to worry about
I did n't say shit
You should already know that Watch the movie Donnie I have something to show you
It is the name of my father and his father before me
I am so sorry
Take it off I want to see you
Yeah Tell me why you 're wearing that stupid bunny suit
You have to do something for me first
Do you believe in time travel Donnie
You 'll know soon enough
We just want to guide you in the right direction
I can do anything I want and so can you
Go home Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine
A hundred and one I think Every day she does the same thing But there 's never any mail
I do n't wan na talk about it
We went to a hotel
Yeah
Who 's Frank
Why Is this about the book
Where are we going
There 's something you have to know Gretchen Everything is going to be just fine
It 's safe here
Yeah they told me to get out of the house
But you 're OK
Where is she
Hey You OK
Then when I have to talk to you
Will you please talk to me
What 's wrong with you
The whole movie Let 's go
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs And each photograph is of something peaceful or beautiful Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside
Infant Memory Generators
Maybe she 's asleep
She wrote it There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I 've been seeing It ca n't just be a coincidence Will you come see her with me
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road
I 've been seeing stuff a lot of really messed-up stuff Do you know who Grandma Death is
They suspended me for two days
We 're moving through time
I always wanted it to be at a time when when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be
That 's alright I understand
Well
You know we 've been going together for a week and a half
With like images
Why not just buy your baby a night light
I do n't want to talk about it So what happened to your neck
Well maybe someone is like giving you these dream steroids And sleepwalking is someone showing you the way
Do you ever feel as though there 's always someone watching you
Donnie
No Every time I wake up somewhere different Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge
It 's like this big force that 's in your brain But sometimes it grows bigger and it spread down into your arms and legs and it just sends you someplace
No I just wake up and I look around try to figure out where I am how I got there
I 'm going home
Sure
Where are we going
That was a compliment
You 're weird
Why is that
Until it withers away
Wonder where we 'll be then
You mean soap
That 's easy Antiseptics
What makes you think I 'm not
I 'm sorry I was in jail once I accidentally burned down this house It was abandoned I got held back in school again Ca n't drive until I 'm eighteen I think when I grow up I want to be a painter Or maybe a writer or maybe both Then I 'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book You know change things
Wow Did he go to jail
Oh I have those too What kind of problems does your dad have
So you just moved here
I 'm not But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit
Sure
School 's cancelled
Hey
People are n't that simple
FARMER Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions
FARMER The Lifeline is divided that way
FARMER Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline
It feels wonderful
If I 'm lucky So I wo n't be back until the first Your dad will be back on Sunday so I 've put Elizabeth in charge until then She has the car so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow
He ca n't Samantha He 's been suspended from after-school activities Donnie are you still with us How was your therapy session tonight
Grandma Death
You know it would be nice to look at you some time and see my son I do n't recognise this person today
I wish I knew where you went at night Did you toilet paper the Johnson 's house
Oh please tell me Elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck
You 're such a fuck-ass
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn 'Cause that 's a great place to raise children
I know Dad
A lot of people Teachers Younger kids It 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason But that 's OK because I know I deserve it
I guess she just lost faith in the world
You know Roberta Sparrow We almost hit her with the car the other day
Grandma Death
You tell Dr Thurman whatever you want
No apparently they ca n't tell us what happened yet Something about a matching serial number that got burned But I had to sign a form saying I would n't talk to anyone about it
Know what
Good Lord So the construction guys say it 'll take about a week to fix the roof Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match
So how was school today
I think I already have But now she wo n't even talk to me
POMEROY Sometimes it 's the only thing that keeps us going
POMEROY A famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language of all the endless combinations of words in all of history that Cellar Door is the most beautiful
POMEROY Tell them that everything is going to be just fine It is up to the children to save themselves these days Because the parents they do n't have a clue
POMEROY Thank you Donnie And you 're a good student Lazy but a good student Unlike most of the others you question Mom and Dad 's rules
POMEROY I do n't know That 's a good question but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher They fired me
POMEROY Donnie it 's Friday Should n't you be off with your friends scaring old people
Of course A rabbit is not like us It has no history books it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret I like bunnies and all They 're cute and they 're horny And if you 're cute and horny then you 're probably happy that you do n't know who you are or why you 're even alive But the only thing I 've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human
Why should we care
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit
Well they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds When they flood the house That like destruction is a form of creation So the fact that they burn the money is ironic They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart They want to change things
THURMAN Goodbye Donald
THURMAN Donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God You are an agnostic An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God but does not deny the possibility that God exists
THURMAN Your medication They 're placebos Just pills made out of water
It 's too late I 've already ruined my life
He 's right there He can read my mind and he 'll show me the way out of this The sky is going to open up and then He will reveal himself to me
I can see him right now
Frank is going to kill
Soon Time is almost up
It would have to be God 's portal They will lead me to it Then I will go back in time and I wo n't feel regret anymore
Grandma Death will teach me how Soon
I have the power to build a time machine
THURMAN Where are we going
THURMAN God exists because you 're horny
THURMAN Why
THURMAN If God exists
THURMAN Why did you do these things Donnie Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes
THURMAN You 've done it again
THURMAN What else makes you feel regret
THURMAN How did you feel being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos
THURMAN What did you want for Christmas that year
THURMAN Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead
THURMAN But you were punished
THURMAN But it was an accident The house was under construction
THURMAN Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world to set the world on fire
THURMAN So your parents why did you disappoint them
THURMAN And when I clap my hands together twice you will wake up Do you understand
Yeah you know Fucking
I mean Gretchen She wo n't even let me kiss her She says because it 's our first kiss she 's like waiting for this big moment or something I just do n't get it I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff
Whoa That 's OK Dr Thurman it 's nothing to be embarrassed about I have sexual fantasies all the time too
THURMAN Are you embarrassed by these things that you see
THURMAN Have you told Gretchen about the spears
THURMAN What did you find
THURMAN And they grow out of our stomachs
I 'd like to believe that I 'm not but I 've just never seen any proof So I just choose not to bother with it It 's like I could spend my whole life thinking about it debating it in my head Weighing the pros and cons And in the end I still would n't have any proof So I do n't even debate it any more Because it 's absurd I do n't want to be alone So does that make me like an atheist
No She died when I was eight We could n't find her for days She went and crawled underneath our back porch
It reminded me of my dog Callie
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman She wrote a book about time travel Frank asked me if I believed in time travel That ca n't just be a random coincidence My dad almost hit her with the car the other day and she said the creepiest thing She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone
I do n't know Gretchen has a theory That Frank is a sign I told her I thought it was ridiculous
I do n't think so It 's like a TV station And they 're tuned into mine and no one else 's
Four times so far
THURMAN Donnie I want to hear about your friend Frank
THURMAN What about your family Donnie
THURMAN Who is the boss
THURMAN What else do you think about during school
THURMAN I asked you about school
THURMAN How are things going at school
THURMAN Do you think a lot about girls
THURMAN What is her name
THURMAN So tell me about your day Donald
THURMAN And when I clap my hands twice you will wake up Do you understand
THURMAN Do you believe that the world is coming to an end
THURMAN Follow him where
THURMAN Frank instructed you to get out of bed just before this happened
THURMAN I do n't own a television
THURMAN How so
THURMAN Frank
THURMAN Would you like to talk about this friend
THURMAN All of this certainly is n't your mother 's fault Donald
THURMAN Your mother said that you 've been skipping cycles of your medication
Okay but it has to be a small one
Congratulations
That 's a nice name OK let me see it
Yeah well that 's not the way the world works If you keep being too honest the world will eventually find a way to destroy you
It 's not that I mean mouthing off to your teachers I 'll admit when Dad told me what you said to Ms Farmer I laughed my ass off
No I do n't She worries about you
Why would I tell Mom
What 's her name
So I hear you have a girlfriend
What does time travel have to do with philosophy
Maybe you 'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication
Well I think you 're the fucking Anti-Christ
Well Jim I think you 're full of shit
Gerald
How much are they paying you to be here
If that 's what you think is necessary
I What can we do
You 're telling me my son has an imaginary friend
Frank
Come again
Well you know about his past And when you said to look for signs of aggression He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher
Thank you for seeing us We just felt that it was time to discuss
He was a year ahead of us
What
So let me get this straight No airline will claim ownership of the engine So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof Fuck that We 're taking the money out of savings
Our son just called me a bitch
Here are the keys to the Taurus There 's plenty of groceries in the fridge And I left money on the kitchen table And do n't forget
It is a big deal
How did you know
You can suck a fuck
Did you just call me a fuck-ass
Excuse me
I have n't been accepted yet mother
COLE How did this happen
COLE Christ Is that an axe
COLE What else
FARMER Rose I do n't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters This has been a dream of ours for a long time Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion
FARMER Yes And believe me of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you given the predicament with your son But none of the other mothers are able to go
FARMER Rose I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning And as you know the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning Now as their coach I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip
FARMER Please Do n't say those words Well as you can see many of us are devastated by this news This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest which involves you
FARMER Rose we have a crisis I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham
FARMER Rose
Kitty I do n't know what to say They 've suspended him for two days Ever since this jet fiasco I honestly do n't know what has gotten into him
Do you even know who Graham Greene is
Excuse me but what is the real issue here The PTA does n't ban books from school
COLE This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation
FARMER The bottom line Mr Cole is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour
FARMER Mr Cole not only am I a TEACHER but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child Therefore I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge
I stole four beers from my dad
Not Vanity He 's a homo
Smurfette does n't fuck

Fine keep on yelling Do everything you can to disturb Firefly Now what about your cousin
The population must increase With great rapidity We give a couple seven years To raise a family If by that time there is no branch Upon the family tree we stand 'em up against the wall and Pop goes the Weasel
If any man should come between A husband and his bride We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide If she prefers the other man The husband steps outside We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel
I will not stand for anything that 's crooked or unfair I 'm strictly on the up and up So everyone beware If anyone 's caught taking graft And I do n't get my share we 'll stand 'em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel

Oh yes UPSTART
Was it swine
Oh you mean worm
What I called you Why what did I call you
I am willing to apologize I 'm willing to do anything to prevent this war
I 'm sorry we lost our tempers I 'm willing to forget if you are
Bah
Yes
That 's it No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart
Once more

That 's what you think
This has gone far enough This interruption is humiliating to say the least
Ca n't we go some place where we can be alone
And Vera niece too
Go ahead
Why yes I met you at the dog races say you could have won that race if you tried a little harder
I 'll tell you what I 'll do I 'll give you Mrs Teasdale as security or my jackknife If you want my advice you 'll take the jackknife I 've a better proposition Make it 25 and I 'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose
Well in the meantime could you let me have 50 personally
I 'll keep the greetings but you can send back the good will what we need right now is twenty million dollars
That 's even a greater honor
You know I think they think I should be king Although it would please me to govern the throng suppose I were king and then everything went wrong
TEASDALE But
TEASDALE I said I suspect the Secretary of War
TEASDALE I I may be wrong but I suspect the Secretary of War
TEASDALE My purse has been stolen the plans of war are in it
TEASDALE Your Excellency something terrible has just happened
TEASDALE I hope I 'm not interrupting
TEASDALE Why why of course
TEASDALE Oh your Excellency you take me off my feet
TEASDALE Now er
Well maybe I am a little headstrong But you know it 's awfully hard to forget what he called me
Let him patch up his own breeches
So you 've come to ask for clemency I 'll give the enemy no quarter not a dime
TEASDALE Oh Your Excellency I do n't know what to say
TEASDALE Oh Rufus
TEASDALE Why that 's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg
TEASDALE Your Excellency you must n't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives Have you got your speech ready

Oh Then there his somebody else
but would further cement the relations of our countries
TEASDALE Ambassador I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator
TEASDALE Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis Without his country 's financial aid
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason
Fine nothing I did n't want war My plan was to marry Mrs Teasdale and overthrow Firefly
This is all Firefly 's fault that idiot that fool
My dear niece I must ask you not to interfere War is not a woman 's problem
That 's where you come in I 'll leave him in your hands and do n't forget you 're supposed to be my niece
With Mrs Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control
If only I could find her If only she could see me now here with such lovely kind friends You Mrs Treves and you Mr Treves Then maybe she would love me as I am I 've tried to hard to be good
She has the face of an angel She was an angel She was so kind so kind to me It 's not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant I 'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her
Oh yes
They have noble faces
And here is one of Frederick 's mother
Oh yes You have so many nice things and so much room
One or two
Mr Merrick sugar
Am I a good man or am I a bad man
But why did I do it What was this all for So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort Or so I could become famous
That I am very little different from him
Oh I 've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said
Hmmm
Dinner will be served shortly dear
And here are my mother and father
Do you
I 've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon when Carr Gomm meets him Somehow between now and then I 've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man Why am I fooling myself Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm
I 'm sorry I do n't know either I just do n't know
And what qualities are those Intelligence or stupidity
I do n't know I ca n't explain it If this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then I 'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best I can to help him live as full and content a life as possible But If he 's an imbecile who 's body I ca n't treat and who 's mind I ca n't touch well then my obligation is discharged They can put him where they will he wo n't be bothered I wo n't be bothered and everyone 's conscience can remain free and untroubled And that is my dilemma what is in his mind
He is I mean I 've always thought he was I think he must be Is he simple Or is that just something I 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself
Well I was n't sure whether he was parroting me because that 's all he was capable of or whether he sensed that that 's all I wanted to hear and he was trying to please me
I should n't be We made great progress today I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases He did rather well too but I had to lead him every step of the way Though frankly at times I was unsure of who was leading whom
No I think a whiskey
Yes very well I think Are the girls in bed
I 'll join you shortly
I 'll get my bag
What is it
Did you see it
Yes
Shut up
I 'll show you I 'll show you
If he does it 's his own fault But I 'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh
He 's doing it to spite me I tell you and it 's got to stop
You sly bastard You 're doing this to spite me are n't you
Now I think we really do understand one another
So you can beat him So you can starve him A dog in the street would fare better with you
You do n't own this man
All you do is profit from another man 's misery
I know what you 've done to him and he 's never going back to that
You misunderstood This man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning He 's my patient now and I must do what
He 's still very sick Please come downstairs with me I 'll explain the situation
Just a moment how did you get in here
Everything will be seen to
You listen you 're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies He 's got the rale he 's very weak and I do n't know how much damage has been done by his fall Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab
This man belongs in hospital
Why is he sitting up like this He needs rest
He must have taken quite a fall
What happened
He was fine when he left here and now look at him
What did you do to him He 's been like this all night
Do n't you think this is a bit premature We do n't have the backing yet to
Well I 'll let you know if there 's something in the afternoon post
Frankly Treves it 's not what I 'd expected A few small cheques Well wishers Do n't worry these things undoubtedly take time
Well it 's up to us then is n't it
Do n't we
Do you think they 'll go along with us
Well yes
I could easily arrange
No you ca n't You ca n't begin to know no one can
Can you imagine what his life has been like
Treves Well done
I do n't understand
I 'm sorry too He simply does n't belong here He 's be much happier somewhere else where he could be constantly looked after Believe me Frederick it 's better that it worked out this way Good day
It was a nice try Treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words
Oh yes
Yes I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables I 'm afraid that they were n't very encouraging but they said they 'd bring it up at their next committee meeting so we should have their answers shortly
As I said it 's only a physical problem but I do feel that Mr Merrick is very flattered that you 're taking the time and trouble to meet him and he 's most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous
It 's only a physical problem He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth But he can talk and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying just tell me and I 'll make it clear
Two o'clock then you know Treves It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon
Singularly unpleasant chap uh I do n't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient Mr Treves
Then will you meet him as a representative of the committee
I do n't agree No one can make a reasonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met
Well sir perhaps I should explain
He 's doing very well In fact that 's why I came to see you I think that if I were to present Mr Merrick to the hospital committee then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease but of the man as well If the committee had a chance to speak with him hear him say a few words for himself I 'm sure they would see him as a patient rather than as a violation of the rules
Ah no sir I had planned to see them in the morning
Yes sir I 'll look into that Would you like to meet him sir
No more of an acquaintance
Yes I 'm well aware of that But this case is quite exceptional
Yes sir
Well sir he 's quite seriously deformed and I fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
No sir he 's got bronchitis and he 's been badly beaten
Indeed
Do n't be mad This muck can kill you
You 've acquired a taste for this
Good morning Treves
I am very pleased to meet you
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies Thou anointest my head with oil
Yes of course Well it 's been a pleasure meeting you Mr Merrick Good day
Of course How long did you and Mr Treves prepare for this interview
Everyone has been very kind I am extremely grateful
I feel much better Thank you
I feel much better Thank you for asking And you
He 's imbecile no doubt from birth He speaks but it 's all gibberish No the man 's a homeless idiot I pray God he 's an idiot
Nothing of any importance eh
Certainly if you insist You must have quite a find there
Good Lord Freddie What have you got in there
I say Freddie what are you about
Abominable things these machines One ca n't reason with them
Three quarters of an hour
HEN I know no way to mince it in love but directly to say I love you What A speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl 'd pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
HEN What say you fair one That the tongues of men are full of deceits
HEN An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
HEN O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate
HEN Fair Katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady 's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart
Oh no

Thank you Mothershead Have a porter put them in my office
You 're right Mothershead please forgive me Of course I appreciate everything you 've done for John and I 'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare But I 'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best I 'm also very late so please forgive me
Are n't you being just a little harsh Mothershead You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived
Now Mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for John He relishes contact with people outside the hospital
Oh Well quickly please Mothershead I 'm overdue
Incredible is n't it Well I think John has had enough visitors for one day Mothershead I 've got a lecture at the college I 'll be back this evening
Watery headed bunch
Parrots can do as much Mr Treves It 's all very nice but I do n't see the point You know they wo n't let him stay here
Good Lord Mr Treves
He 's had his share of smacks Mothershead I expect that 's what drives him under the bed We must use patience and understanding with this man
No he 's very upset about something
Not quite yet Mrs Mothershead There seems to be some difficulty this morning
Yes The workhouse
Yes Yes let 's go in
Yes Well I want you to clear up a little mess a breakfast tray was spilt And bring up another breakfast When you 've done that you and I shall give the man a bath But Mothershead I 'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this Above all do not scream do not cry out or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him
Good Excellent Now then Mrs Mothershead I want you to come into this room with me Inside there is a man with a rather unfortunate appearance
Ah Mothershead How are you feeling today
PORTER YOU 'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME I ai n't done nothing wrong People pay to see your monster Mr Treves I just take the money
PORTER When I left him he was in his bed safe and sound
PORTER Take him Now wait I did n't take him anywhere We were just having some fun We did n't hurt him just having a laugh that 's all
PORTER I I do n't know what you mean Sir
I 'll send a cab Here is my card
So you 'll bring him to me tomorrow 10:00 a.m Mr
Pardon me
I 'd pay handsomely for a private showing Are you the proprietor
Just one of the curious I 'd like to see it
Are you the proprietor
It 's sinking Hy-Brasil is sinking
ARNULF It 's all right It is n't happening
It 's your fantasy
There is no magic Father My mother had no magic
It 's all in your own mind Father It 's YOU who imagine that I 'm always up here with some man or other
ARNULF Ah So you admit there IS someone
ARNULF Well where is he
ARNULF Who Who Whoever you 've got in here of course
ARNULF Right Where is he
Ah It 's my father
But Aud I I came to find someone
No no
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard The Gods will never let you return
Blow the third note The note to take us home
Erik You 've done what you came to do
The second note
Yes I believe you do
I but I
Of course
I MUST look Keitel Hold this
That 's right
No WAIT ERIK The Cloak The Cloak Invisible It only seems to work on my father
Goodbye Aud
No It 's YOU who does n't understand Aud Halfdan has come to kill and destroy We brought him here We must stop him
I 'll bring it back
Why
I mean you could have killed yourself
But Erik
Who
And the week before that
Five this week how many the week before
And I thought you said it was something special
The fifth one this week
I 've never been to bed with anybody
You 've been to bed with somebody else have n't you
We never went to bed together
Oh oh I did n't know her very well
It was different
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else
You mean you HAVE got into bed with somebody else
What you mean got into bed with them
But surely you know
WHY
What
What 's the matter
Those things in your hands
Please Please What are those
How d'you KNOW we 're friends
WELCOME
WHAT did you say
We blew the Horn Resounding
What d'you mean
It was my master Keitel 's idea
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods so I disguised myself to sabotage their plans
That I can not tell you
I will go and wake them up
Is there nothing men can do
Of course not but when I was a child I remember a dream it was as if the whole sky was blue
The sun is up beyond the clouds where it always is
Is it summer or winter Erik
Is it night or day Erik
What do you see Erik
I should n't have come
ARNULF The important thing is not to panic
ARNULF Then I expect you 'll be leaving first thing in the morning
ARNULF Well it 's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing You DO know how to play the horn do n't you
ARNULF Is there something the matter with it
You do n't know Halfdan the Black
He wants to kill US
Because that 's how he makes his money by war and plunder
He 's trying to stop us waking the Gods
ARNULF It 's all part of our safety regulations You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then well
ARNULF Careful They 're not supposed to hurt you
ARNULF I 'll tell you what
The Gods are asleep King Arnulf
Your Majesty We come from a world where there IS no music Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword
No
No no It was very er nice
ARNULF Right Summon the musicians We 'll do the one that goes TUM-TUM-TUM TUM-TI-TUM-TUM
ARNULF And you 're not just saying it because you think we want you to
ARNULF REALLY
ARNULF You 're just saying that
No no We 'd love to hear it Would n't we
I 'm sure it 's lovely
Oh no no no It 's just the Horn Resounding is
Oh well yes of course it 's just we 're looking for the Horn Resounding and
That 's very kind of you but we 're in rather a hurry We 're
ARNULF Well is n't it great
ARNULF Well for a start er there 's no killing
ARNULF The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves
I do n't know I just did
Odin
Is THAT Odin
Have you tried to ask the God for anything
What 's the point of being dead in the land of the living
What a stupid idea
Tell me your name
Why should you care
You told them I raped you why
I did n't mean to
Oh thanks
Louder
Scream
I just said I did n't feel like raping you
Oh Stop talking as if we were married
To pay for the next expedition of course
Oh well you 've GOT to do them
Well it just seems a little bit crude that 's all
About NOT raping you
I 'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone
I do n't suppose you you DO like me at all
I do n't suppose no
No It is n't rape then is it
No right this is RAPE Mark you I 'm not saying I could n't get to like you in fact well to be quite honest I prefer it when there 's some sort of mutual feeling between two people
Of course I like women I LOVE 'em
It 's obvious you have n't raped anyone in your life
What about the raping
Looting and pillaging eh
Have you done this sort of thing before
It 's not magic It 's just a trick
But You 're not even afraid of DEATH Thorfinn
I know
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed
You do n't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make friends
No
Very deep usually
It saved my father
I know Snorri Get your oar out
Come on move it
He was lucky Sit there
What
But what
FIND the Rainbow Bridge
I I KILLED her
She got me thinking
I met this girl
Where does it all get us Grandpa
We toil and labor we loot and pillage rape and kill and yet
What 's it all about
Make your mind up
Sorry
Sorry
Row Row Row
Well you ARE
Look out
You 'll see
'S DAD I 've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you can not fight
'S DAD It 's magic
Look the sky is blue
'S DAD SHUT UP
'S DAD Ohh I wanted to sit next to Leif
What are YOU doing here
But you 're the Gods
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed
Because you 're you 're the Gods
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun men fight and kill each other the whole time
You must help us
You 'll be sucked down too
No Let go Snorri
Were n't we supposed to
A magic dishcloth
Listen Maybe we wo n't get to Hy Brasil Maybe we wo n't find the Horn Resounding but at least we 've tried and at least we shall have died like men
First we 're flying now we 're sinking
Row
That 's better
That 's true You 'd better sit there You there and Ornulf there
Trust me to get the missionary
It 's SO nice to feel wanted
Thank you VERY much indeed
You mean we 'd be dead
Right Farewell for the last time may the gods prevent
Oh right Well CHEERS everybody
What 's the matter with them
You need to say a bit more than that
Who gets killed
What are you talking about
What is it
How about making friends
But
But how could he know unless
What 's the matter with Bjorn
Keitel Blacksmith
I have to go
Let me do something for myself for a change
Over the Edge of the World
Is THIS Hy-Brasil
She MUST have a knife or something
DEATH
We have n't got a spare place
I do n't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time
Yes it does We could be at sea for months
Look I bagged it last week
Hey you two What 's going on
But HOW
Nobody 's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard
Only the dead reach Asgaard Erik
What are you talking about Erik
And you Sven are n't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard
That 's why they call me Leif the Lucky
You will wait
Bye sorry
Well where is he then
Vanish into thin air
How did he do that
'S DAD What do we have to do
'S DAD The Dragon
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord
Your lord
No it is NOT
Thorbjorn Vifilsson 's wife became a Buddhist not a Christian
Listen I 've been in this dump for sixteen years and I have n't made a single convert
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way
Mum Dad
Oh yes I had n't noticed that
And a sort of slightly sick feeling
Is it sort of like a sinking feeling in your stomach
He used to puke in his sleep
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage the whole time non-stop puke puke puke
I mean many of the greatest sailors were
You do n't need to feel bad about being sea-sick you know
Are you all right
For your own sake For the others I
I 'm not worth risking your life for
Let me go Sven
Aaagh
Get away Snorri
What
It 's me I 'm just going to water the dragon
I I
It 's not my business any more
Made by YOU Loki
I should have got rid of you long ago
We came to stop you waking the Gods Erik But I did n't want anyone to get hurt
No It 's YOU Loki I should never have listened to you
She knows it was our fault
Help
You 'll drown us bo
Urrgh Argh Let go you idiot
Relax
You 'll be able to throw it further than I could
Sh Hurry
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods
Was n't it Keitel
Together we stand
The Blacksmith 's Code says I must
My brother blacksmiths
The bottom falls out of the sword business
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky
Ca n't make enough axe-heads
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok Keitel Blacksmith it is GOOD to us
Oh I could n't do that The Blacksmith 's Code says
You could charge him what you like
Ooh that 's a good one You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one
Dad
Easy Dad
'S DAD Helpless
GIVE US A CHANCE Dad
I 'm just building up to it Dad
'S DAD Sh
DEATH TO DRAGONS
'S DAD Stop it
'S DAD It 's no good going berserk against a dragon
'S DAD Not now Sven
I KNOW I 'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES
I must only let the red rage
But it 's a responsibility
So did your father
You went berserk
I know Dad
Tell him I 'm coming
You 'll see my grandfather in Valhalla
Thorfinn You ca n't die
Shut up
Well I 'm game
Well I 'M certainly not either
He 's not in Valhalla He died of old age
'S MUM And if you have to kill somebody KILL them Do n't stop to think about it
'S MUM And keep your sword greased
'S MUM And do n't forget never let your enemy get behind you
'S MUM And something to sharpen them with
'S MUM And you 've got BOTH axes
Who was the girl you walked off with
Yeah you told me that later
I remember
I remember you turned around Your face was dark and your hair was backlit I could see a halo of frizz you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me
I 'm sorry Naomi could n't make it You okay You seem quiet
Yeah
Thanks guys
They ca n't erase memories It 's a joke It 's a nasty Clementine hoax
I do n't know I 'm so I ca n't believe she 'd be so goddamn immature
She 's punishing me for being honest I should just go to her house
Hi Joel So no jokes about my name
You did You liked me
But I do n't know maybe we 're the normal ones y'know I mean what kind of people do well at this stuff
Anyhoo sweetie I done a bad thing I kinda sorta wrecked your car
Here we are
How are you today
Ms Kruczynski
Yeah hi I have a one o'clock with Dr Mierzwiak Clementine Kruczynski

Now Now I have to go now I have to see the frozen Charles Now Tonight
Come up to Boston with me
Oh Tangerine
Oh baby what 's going on
In the room
I really want to but tonight 's important Test tomorrow
I ca n't I want to but I have to study
I was not
I just thought I 'd say hi I was in the neighborhood
Maybe gay is n't the right word But anyway it 's been rough with him whatever the fuck he is Heheh My significant other heh heh And I guess on a certain level I want to break it off but I feel y'know it 's like this constant questioning and re questioning Do I end it Should I give it more time I 'm not happy but what do I expect Relationships require work You know the drill The thing that I keep coming back to is I 'm not getting any younger I want to have a baby at some point maybe right So then I think I should settle which is not necessarily the best word I mean he 's a good guy It 's not really settling Then I think maybe I 'm just a victim of movies y'know That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be But then I think no this is what I really want so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it You know Agreed But then I think he is a good guy and It 's complicated Y'know
You guess he 's your boyfriend Or you guess you 're having a bad time with him
Well why do n't you tell me what 's going on Do you mind if I turn this on
How are you today
What old mill Is that somewhere we
I ca n't stop thinking about you
We should have sex It 's old hat for us
Says you were constantly calling me a slob It 's sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overly-familiar and bored Do n't you think
Does n't sound like me
Did I use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
Well sounds like me Sorry man Says you were jealous and suspicious
A bully Moi
Says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling
Well you obviously do n't know me
I 'm nervous too
Hey Joel
That 's okay I
Oh um
Make love

I hesitated for what seemed like forever
It 's freezing out here
Cool
Female
Oh
Let 's move into this neighborhood
I wish we did You married
Yeah yeah It goes Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines
Yeah maybe
I think before
Me too There 's this poem
Really Me too I do n't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova
I 'll give you a couple See what you think
You should try Xanax I mean it 's a chemical and all but it works and it works just having it around knowing that it 's there Like insurance
But my sleeping is really fucked up
No I stopped I did n't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated
What do we do
This is it Joel It 's gon na be gone soon
Yeah like that
I 'm Joel
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
You said
You know what I did
I ca n't tell you how happy I am to hear that I mean I do n't mean I 'm happy you 're uncomfortable but yknow I 'm such a loser Every time I come to a party I tell myself I 'm going to be different and it 's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod
I saw you sitting over here By yourself I thought thank God someone normal who does n't know how interact at these things either
Hi
Remember me Try your best Maybe we can
I know
Probably
I had you pegged did n't I
Joel I 'm not a concept I want you to just keep that in your head Too many guys think I 'm a concept or I complete them or I 'm going to make them alive but I 'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind Do n't assign me yours
Okay
Not yet Not married
I 'd like to take you out or something
Sorry to track you down like this I 'm not a stalker But I needed to see you
I did it I guess that means something
I told her today I need to end it
It 's very late
I dropped you off after You said
So what Infatuation is good too
I was so nervous I remember I could n't think of anything to say There were long silences
I 'm sure I said
We did talk about Naomi
Right Something black though
Egad were you horrified
What was I wearing
Naomi I guess
This is our first date date
Yeah
I love it
Thanks Joely A present Oh boy
I do n't like it either but I 'm just trying to find horrible secret place to
This kid Joe Early is going to beat the shit out of me
Hide me somewhere deeper Somewhere buried
Yes but I ca n't love a man named Wally
But ca n't you see I love you Antoine
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased
There 's this guy I heard him talking in my apartment He 's one of the eraser guys And he fell for you when they were erasing you so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you 're dating him
There 's this guy
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good like you just woke up slightly sweaty And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like
I loved you so much this day On my bed in your panties I remember I thought how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties
Joel Joely look it 's not fading The memory I think we 're hidden
I 'm right here
Well if they 're looking for me in memories I 'm in what if you take me to a memory I 'm not in And we can hide there till morning
What if you hide me
Wow Um well ca n't you just force yourself awake
Oh
Such a beautiful view
No
Yeah Tangerine
No Thanks
Joel you 're a liar
I want to know you
You do n't tell me things Joel I 'm an open book I tell you everything Every damn embarrassing thing You do n't trust me
You 're drunk
So um
Oh thank God It 's going
Clem I 'm sorry I should n't have
Joel We 're fucking gon na talk about it
What
You 're not ready
No I want to have a baby I have to have a baby
I want to have a baby
I 'm fucking crawling out of my skin
How can you watch this crap
Fuck you Joel Faggot
No see Clem I assume you fucked someone tonight Is n't that how you get people to like you
Oh Christ I did n't kill anybody It 's just a fucking dent You 're like some old lady or something
Well it is pathetic And fucking irresponsible You could 've killed somebody
I ca n't believe you wrecked my car You 're driving drunk It 's pathetic
Yo ho ho
How could she have done this to me How could anyone do this to anyone
Tonight Just to test out the phone lines and all
When
You 'll call me right
Yes
Okay
You should stay
I 'll pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and
Okay
I think so
That 's scary sounding
Oh yeah
I do n't either I used to But I 'm through with that Y'know if I do n't love my body then I 'm just lost You know With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that 's coming 'round the bend So I 've been seeing this guy
I 'm nervous You do n't need to be nervous around me though I like you Do you think I 'm repulsively fat
You 're very nice God I have to stop saying that You 're nervous around me huh
Like I wanted to talk to you I did n't need any more reason to do it Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist
What 's the goal Joel My goal Joel is to just let it flow through me Do you know what I mean It 's like there 's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we 're all taught we should be consistent Y'know You love someone that 's it Forever You choose to do something with your life that 's it that 's what you do It 's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through And my feeling is that 's how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing You know
And anyway you sell yourself short I can tell There 's a lot of stuff going on in your brain I can tell My goal can I tell you my goal
I like you That 's the thing about my psychic thing I think that 's my greatest psychic power that I get a sense about people My problem is I never trust it But I get it And with you I get that you 're a really good guy
You 're really nice I 'm sorry I yelled at you before about it God I 'm an idiot
Oh Does that make you sad Or anxious I 'm always anxious thinking I 'm not living my life to the fullest y'know Taking advantage of every possibility Just making sure that I 'm not wasting one second of the little time I have
It 's helpful to think there 's some order to things You 're kind of closed mouthed are n't you
Yeah I guess
Yeah I do n't know It 's hard to know
I do n't know
Yeah
Drink up young man It 'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant
I know a man who needs a refill
No stay Just for a little while Refill
I do n't know I ca n't see them from here Joel Just pick something good
You pick it
No I 'm okay for now
Yeah Well have a seat anyway
God that feels so fucking good Take yours off
I miss grade school I do n't know why I 'm calling it grade school all of a sudden When I went we called it elementary school But I like grade school better Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it I 'd like to be from then Everyone wore hats Anyway cheers
Yeah I 'm not like a Robert Frost lover by any stretch His stuff seems strictly grade school to me But this made me cry for some reason Maybe because it is grade school Y'know
Me neither Oh there 's an inscription on the back The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued
Do you believe in that stuff Reincarnation
This someone gave that to me just like recently I like it too I like crows I think I used to be a crow
You like that
Um
Take care
Well I would n't want to be
I 'm just a bit of a wreck I sleep in your hat makes me cry Me
Remember And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I 'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat Oh shit I 'm so stupid Sorry
The song 's 9th and Hennepin I spent most of the train ride trying to remember Till you 're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who 'll listen Remember
Me too It is Rain Dogs by the way
So you like bookstores huh
Look I 'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso I 'm not really
Yeah
I 'm not a stalker
Well I probably would n't say if I were but no
Where do you live
It 's okay
You 're sure It 's cold
Hi I could give you a ride if you need
Probably see you at the book store
It 's no problem Anyway I have some stuff I need to
That 's okay
Yes
Shit Shit I know it 's here Hold on
I do n't need nice I do n't need myself to be it and I do n't need anyone else to be it at me
Now I 'm nice Do n't you know any other adjectives There 's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative mumpish
Why would n't you think that about me
Yeah Although it hardly fits I 'm a vindictive little bitch truth be told
Oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin Clementine No
Huckleberry Hound What are you nuts
Huckleberry Hound
No jokes about my name Oh you would n't do that you 're trying to be nice
My name 's Clementine by the way
Sorry I was just trying to be nice
Oh I doubt that 's the case
You sure That does n't sound
I 'm sure you would
You think that could possibly be a full time job How many hair colors could there be
I do n't really know how
I ca n't remember
Yeah Tom Waits says it in
I like it
I noticed your hair I guess it made an impression on me that 's why I was pretty sure I recognized you
I do n't have one
because I go there all the time I do n't think I ever saw you before
Really Because
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you I thought that earlier in the diner That 's why I was looking at you You work at Borders right
Rockville Center
It 's okay really
I mean it 's okay if you want to sit down here I did n't mean to
No I mean I do n't know I ca n't really think of much to say probably
Anyway Sorry Hi
Well I did n't want to assume
No I did n't know if you were talking to me so
Why what
I 'm sorry
'S VOICE Your dried cum
'S VOICE Guess what I 'm wearing
'S VOICE God I ca n't believe I ever hated you
'S VOICE Hey lover Whatcha doing
'S VOICE Joel we 've fucked We 've made love Like a million times And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night Is n't that lovely
'S VOICE I know I spoke to my friend Magda
That 's what you have to say How could it be true I never even heard of any procedure like this It 's a joke
I mean I have n't even told anyone I 've met you Who would even know to do this
Did you send this Is it a joke
'S VOICE Tomorrow night honeymoon on ice
'S VOICE Ha Ha You said I do I guess that means we 're married
'S VOICE Hmmm Do you miss me
'S VOICE What took you so long
'S VOICE That 's me
I just got in
I know I had to take the day to think
How 's it going
Hi Naomi it 's Joel
I really should go I really need to catch my ride
Clementine
So you 're still on the Zoloft
I remember being drawn to you even then I thought I love this woman because she 's alone down there looking out at the black ocean
This is it The night we met My God it 's over
On the couch Dark Quiet I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times I thought I could take it back erase it explain I had momentarily lost my mind Then I told myself we were n't happy That was the truth That what we were was safe It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it was n't much fun But I wanted fun I saw other people having fun and I wanted it Then I thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun I 'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit then I thought maybe not maybe not And then I thought as I always do at this point in my argument about dying
I did n't want to do this But I had to or they would 've called me a girl
I loved you on this day I love this memory The rain Us just hanging
Is that like us Are we just bored with each other
And what are you like A wino
Any messages Carmen
So then she just stops calling
Got ta get home How could she do this to me How could she not care about what we meant to each other What a fuck What a fucking monster she is
Clementine
I love you and if you knew that if I told you what happened I 'll explain everything what we meant to each other I 'll tell you everything about our time together You 'll know everything again and
I should maybe talk to you
It 's them
Pink There was a number on it I remember AL 1718 I have to follow through with this I have no choice
Maybe I 'm making a mistake Maybe I just need to learn to live with this First of all I 'll get over it Secondly it happened Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it Who said that Churchill I 'm not sure But I do n't care She did it to me I have to rid myself of this Fuck her
I 'm like a joke to them
There are two of them Could n't make them out The orange glow of a cigarette
Yes but I 'm just something you 're imagining What can I do I 'm in your head too
What What do you mean
We can help you through this Why do n't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about
We can help you through this Why do n't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine
I 'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards You never should have
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage
'Night
So I 'm going to get some sleep I 'm glad you 're okay
Okay Joel I suppose you 're right
So you think the dissertation will get published
I 'm sorry I really should n't have
Oh Great That 's great
I miss you
Well it was my fault the break up I 'm sorry
It 's been a pretty lonely couple of years
Yeah
Say hi to Rob and Carrie Have some fun
So you do n't mind
Yeah Come to bed I 'm cold
Hi Rob and Carrie
How was it
Hi
The thing is Joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off you 're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems
Bullshit Who is it You met someone
Do n't say we when you mean you
What
So what 's going on Joel
Naomi I really value our relationship I hope it 's possible for us to stay in touch
Yours
Definitely
Very cool Trippy
Yeah Cool
Nah I do n't know
Hi Mary How 's it going
Mary please This is hurting people
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased
Mary people come to him voluntarily
I do n't know I just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office
I know what it is
What 's this
What do you want Stan
Oh
You were in red That red sweater with the little flowers I think You were leaning against his car He looked a little like a kid Kind of goofy and wide-eyed I 'd never seen him look like that before Happy You looked beautiful You looked in love
I really like you Mary You know that
And after that
How did I look
Once maybe
I swear
Hey
You better go
This guy 's only half cooked There 's no time to fuck around Stan
Shit
I do n't know I just said that
I do n't know what to do I do n't know what to do Crap Crap
Where
Listen it 's not erasing
It 's stopped
To let people begin again It 's beautiful You look at a baby and it 's so fresh so clean so free And adults they 're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness hopelessness And Howard just makes it go away
It 's amazing is n't it Such a gift Howard gave the world
Let him go Stan I can help
Do n't you think Howard 's like that Smart Important
It 's a good one all right
That 's a good one
Well allow me to do the honors It 's fucking freezing and I need something
Yeah Poor guy Have anything to drink
It 's freezing out
Hey if you 're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak would you
See you later alligator
I know Anyway
Sorry I just
Hi
I did n't make you You thought it best But look I take full responsibility
It was a mutual decision
I have a family Mary
I do n't know what I 'm supposed say Mary I want to do the right thing here
We have a history I 'm sorry You wanted the procedure You wanted it done to get past I have to finish in there It 's almost morning We 'll talk later
No you 're right Once again You 're a decent man Howard
I wish I was your wife I wish I had your kids
I 've loved you for a very long time I 'm sorry I should n't have said that
It 's fine Mary I 'm happy to hear it
That 's lovely
It 's no big deal
Alexander Pope
It 's a good quote Mary I 'm glad we both know it
Is that Nietzsche
Oh Well I 'd love to hear some
How do you mean
Well thank you Mary
Okay we 're back in
Thanks
Order me a pastrami for after
Mary
Howard your one o'clock
Jesus All right what 's the address
Well where was Patrick
Okay what happened right before he disappeared
Stan What 's going on
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people
She should not have done this Stan As mad as she was as justifiably
So I 've got to drop the van off
I 'll go out for a smoke If no one minds
Howard they 've disappeared again
You get some sleep Howard I 'll take it from here
Did you try going through C-Gate
She came to help Howard
December 15th 2004 I met someone tonight Oh Christ I do n't know what to do Her name is Clementine and she 's amazing So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long
Maybe after the holidays then
Of course Please have a seat
I think he 's in a conference Unfortunately I 'm really sorry
Oh hi
I can handle it He 's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway
Patrick we 're in the middle of
It 's a quote book
Okay There 's more Stan
Mary hates me I 've never been popular with the ladies
She was beautiful So sweet and funky and voluptuous I kind of stole a pair of her panties is what
I got ta tell you something I kind of fell in love with her last night
The thing is my situation is a little weird My girlfriend situation
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over too I have a girlfriend now
I like Mary I like when she comes to visit I just do n't think she likes me
Yeah
Patrick let 's just get through this We have a long night ahead of us
It 's an apartment
Does that help
The voltage looks fine
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I 'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores
The world is n't going to end you dummy I hope you know that much But it is going to change It 's going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue But there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption It is n't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but there 'll be some of us it 'll miss Little pockets of humanity Like the Clock People Like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave There 's almost no worldwide calamity famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you could n't survive in that cave
Easy come easy go
You mean she 's dead
I want to go back to the Clock People I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they 're up to What 's happened to Jelly
Yes everything is getting worse But everything is also getting better
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese And the name stuck In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled Indians through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that Indians misnamed me The Clock People however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes They have lived together since 1906
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp as a Japanese-American I had been put there and watched over I found refuge with the Clock People who discovered me in a snow bank near dead I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe ha ha ho ho and hee hee
Siwash huh
Clockworks
What was that
But I do n't know how to polka
Oh Well there 's been some trouble on the ranch I came up here to get out of the way It 's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down If you could help
I 'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean 's
Where are the others
A traveler eh
You do n't
I know but where do you reside when you are n't visiting New York
Where do you live Miss Hankshaw
Every time I tell you that I love you you flinch But that 's your problem
'Drugged is a stupid word
How did this business get started anyhow Why are the birds nesting here
So be it It looks serious this time though All these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes
FROM MEN THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE 'S MARSHES STOLEN ITS EGGS INVADED ITS PRIVACY POLLUTED ITS FOOD FOULED ITS AIR BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT
I would n't say that I expect she 's right ultimately But I 'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what 's mine I ca n't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink he could probably teach her a thing or two Ee That grass tickles does n't it God knows I love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits Still this is cowgirl territory and I 'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it I guess I 've always been a scrapper Look This scar Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they must n't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age She 's a real dreamer that Debbie-dear
Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her Third Vision has n't happened Niwetükame the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools Tension Cowgirl tension What a drag
Really The Chink huh I 've gathered that you sometimes speak with him What else have you learned from the Chink
No ma'am No way There 's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political but I do n't share their views I got no cowgirl ideology to expound Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
Cowgirls exist as an image A fairly common image The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture Therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail Otherwise they 're being fooled In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls Two And both of 'em are trick-riders Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks That 's what prostitutes call it you know 'tricking
About
Well that does n't matter that part never interested me anyway The beatnicks were before my time and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichés and the clap But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl
Oh I know about Sissy Hankshaw all right I 've done a little hitchhiking myself Ah shucks that 's like telling Annie Oakley you 're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone I 'd heard tales about you from people I 'd meet in jail cells and truckstops I heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac 's girl friend
Welcome podner By God it 's great to have you here It 's an honor Sorry I took so long getting to you but we 've had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do
What guy
If we Ivy Leaguers are n't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we do n't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink Next thing I know you 'll be calling me 'chief
I suppose it was mine Yes it definitely was my fault
Oh we did n't get it all the way on
Well er
COUNTESS Like what
COUNTESS She always leaves town you dummy That does n't mean anything What about in bed How does she like it in bed
COUNTESS Ninety degrees to the left I hope How does she feel about you
COUNTESS It 's high time you realized honey babe that a woman does n't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language
COUNTESS She 's obviously that Jesus Which would you rather have a million dollars or one of Sissy 's thumbs full of pennies
My thumbs hurt I 've made a mistake I 've been negligent I have n't exercised I have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what It 's like a musician practicing his scales When I do n't practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore
I have to go Julian
Getting dressed I 've got to go
It 's not the air conditioner that 's making me cold Nothing moves in here Not even your birds
I 'm cold
Whooee
You 're the best
Hitchhiking
So now you 're bummin around
For magazines
Are you in show business
Thanks
Going north
I do n't know anything about it
COUNTESS Good good good you 'll enjoy it you 'll see Julian is a gentleman
COUNTESS I ca n't be certain that you would But what have you got to lose
COUNTESS Yes well what I 'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity She ca n't wait too long you know Now there 's no reason why you must lose yours I mean just ponder it a bit that 's all
COUNTESS But here you are still a virgin you are virginal yet are n't you
But Countess
If you do n't want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
A job for me
COUNTESS Oh my dear yes I bought a little ranch out West sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder A tax write-off actually
COUNTESS She 's a young thing who works on my ranch Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that She 's cute as a hot fudge taco and of course it takes verve to change one 's name so charmingly But she stinks like a slut just the same
Bonanza Jellybean
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me
I 've always been proud of the way nature singled me out It 's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for I 've been steady moving for eleven years and some months Maybe I should rest up for a spell I 'm not as young as I used to be
A born freak can only go uphill
Tired
I think I found something
Holy shit
Shit Do not do that Where the fuck are you
do you copy
You still need the rope I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins
I can see why they sent you along
That means top-secret Cooper
Ballast
Will it work
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before
Captain Miller we 're ready to repressurize the Clark
But Justin
The containment Second Containment
We have a man down
You 've had plenty EVA Coop it 's Justin 's turn Stay on station If anything happens
You 're convinced the crew could still be alive After seven years
EVERYBODY SHUT UP Let the man speak
This is Cooper what the hell do you do on this ship anyway
Okay listen up As you all know by now we have an addition to our crew Dr Weir this is Starck navigation Smith pilot Justin ship 's engineer
Time to play Spam in the can
Smith clear that airlock man I 'm coming in
We 're still venting trace gasses gim me twenty minutes to plug the hole
What about the accumulator
You 're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix
Shit Smith you 're going Biblical on me
What
You been out there a long time Trying to break my record
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
I do n't know what happened to Justin
You were n't there I saw it
It was like nothing was there and then Justin appeared and the Core became metal
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months It seems impossible but in light of the transmission I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
Coffee
Damn Dr Weir do n't scare us like that Coffee
What
I 'm gon na activate the emergency beacon
I do n't know the process Dr Weir was the expert
There must be a way What about Engineering
You 're okay now it 's over
I do n't know the screens are dead
It is not
Oh God
Oh God DJ what do I how do I
Weir He used one of the explosives from the Corridor
DJ The Clark 's gone Smith and Cooper are dead
Save yourself From Hell What are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
Hear what
It gets worse
They thought it said Liberatis me Save me but it 's not me It 's tutemet Save yourself
I 've been listening to the transmission And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation
No
Another man Who
We 'll make it
I do n't need sleep DJ I need answers
Goddammit DJ it was not a hallucination I saw a man he was on fire And then he disappeared
His vitals are stable but he 's unresponsive to stimuli He might wake up in fifteen minutes He might not wake up at all
No time We need whatever 's left in our suits to repair the Clark Like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
And this is mission specialist Dr William Weir We all know where we 're going Dr Weir is going to tell us why
He 's a rescue technician Peters medical technician DJ
His peritoneum has ruptured
He 's crashing
Pressure
You did n't hear it You must have heard it
A power drain
Nothing It 's nothing
Do n't thank me Bill I 'm not doing you any favors
It 's against my better judgement but I 'll run this by the Man downstairs You 'll know my decision by the end of the day
That ship was lost in deep space seven years ago If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor I 'd find it more plausible Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team investigate the source of the transmission If it really is the Event Horizon they 'll attempt a salvage We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship 's systems for the salvage crew
I would n't bring you here on a hoax Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D codes
I apologize for the short notice Bill but we 've had something come up that requires your immediate attention Lyle
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt she 's docked in bay four
Some things you do n't get over
He does n't belong on this mission Responsible or not he blames himself He 's too close to it And then there 's his wife
Does he know that
The official inquiry blamed Weir 's design for the ship 's loss
You 're not seriously considering sending him
It 's not that simple Lyle play the recording for Dr Weir
Oh my god OH MY GOD
The dark inside I do n't understand
The dark inside me
It wo n't stop it goes on and on and on
I 'm going in
I 've reached another containment door This thing 's huge
We still have pressure The radiation count 's steady at 7 millirads an hour
I built it
is zero That 's what the singularity does it folds space so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time After the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal It 's called a gravity drive
But I ca n't I got ta get out of here Skipper please
I do n't want to die
Justin
Almost done I just got ta check one thing
Yes sir
Start the countdown
Someone sent that message Admiral you have to put me on that ship
The crew Could they still be alive
This is not about my reputation This is not about me at all The Event Horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds Seven years ago we did n't just lose the ship and the crew We lost the dream I have to go
I designed the ship 's propulsion system I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive You ca n't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed That would be like like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle
Dr Weir Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
Thanks
Peters We need to know what happened to the crew Before it happens to us
That 's a negative Starck
I can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
I can use the station in Medical keep an eye on Justin
Yeah I 'm I 'm okay
Peters
Can anybody hear me
how 's the client
Frozen
I found one
Everything 's been shut down Conserving power I guess Green light on the hull it 's intact
Okay I 'm on the bridge
The blood came from somewhere Peters
I can see the hatch
Peters is right no one 's here
That means they did n't abandon ship
Jesus its huge
We 've got pressure
No no its alright I talked to my ex he 'll keep Denny over Christmas and I 'll get him this summer Goddam it Skipper I have n't seen him in two months
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers Good for four months
NOOO
Starck Cooper
You 're lying
Better if I just show you
I 'm not the Devil
You know
Your fear Do you remember the Goliath Miller
Weir is dead
If you miss me you 'll blow out the hull You 'll die too
What are you talking about
Your eyes
I told you She wo n't let you leave
You ca n't leave She wo n't let you
You You ca n't do that
What about my ship
Do n't do n't do this
You 're insane You 've lost your mind
You ca n't your orders are specific
That 's exactly what we do n't have Doctor
The Other Place what is that
Where has it been for the past seven years
To what Where did this ship go Where did you send it
You said this ship creates a gateway
That 's bullshit and you know it You built this fucking ship and all I 've heard from you is bullshit
I want to know what caused that noise I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
Is that your expert opinion The only answer we 've had out of you is I do n't know
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
Check the Core for radiation Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
The Core
I do n't know
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time it 's possible Black holes make sense on paper it 's all math you see but as to what really happened The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like Lazarus returned from the dead
Exactly The ship 's internal clock is off by seven years
The Event Horizon 's computer think 's it 's 2034
The date
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart It may have killed one of my men No one goes near that thing
I want this room sealed The Second Containment is off limits
If it worked
It 's insane
It 's complicated
It 's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core distorting space-time They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark
One of my men is down I want to know what happened to him
Dr Weir 's right Get on board the Event Horizon I 'll meet you at the airlock
They 're empty Dr Weir Moving forward
Negative
Captain Miller the foredecks are just ahead
In an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship That way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
Peters and I will search the forward decks Justin take Engineering No hot-dogging not on this one alright
once we 've secured the ship that 's the way it is I need you to guide us from the comm station This is where I need you Help us to do our job
Once the ship is secured we 'll bring you on board
Dr Weir I need you on the bridge
Smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
That 's what we 're here to find out
It was the ship 's maiden voyage to test the drive The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive And the ship vanished from all our scopes No radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind They disappeared without a trace Until now
I 've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space
Captain Miller I appreciate this opportunity
Captain Miller I just want to say
Where is it where is it
No no we just got her back together
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor I think Weir may have put it on the Clark
Smith get out of there
What is it Smith
Alright Prep the Clark for launch I 'll find her
Now what
Thank you
Sir
you break all the laws of physics you think there wo n't be a price You already killed the first crew
We do n't have time Smith In twenty hours we run out of air
I 'm here Smith how 's the Clark
You heard me Smith Peters are you with me
They 're gone
We 're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked In three minutes our atmosphere will be gone We are fucking dead
Do we have enough time for a weld
Smith where the hell have you been
Starck give me a read
Love to
Starck
Where is it
I noticed Starck anybody home
Dr Weir
I guess we 're about to find out Keep us slow and steady
What are you trying to say If God had intended Man to fly he would have given us wings
We 're all on edge Smith We 're a long way out
We have a lock on the Event Horizon 's navigation beacon It 's in the upper ionosphere we 're in for some chop
Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
What is that
Locked and cocked
He 's dead
Miller he 's back he was in the tank
We 're armed This fucker 's ready to blow
I 'll do it
Blow it up
We 've got to shut it down we 've got to
Whatever was on that bridge was n't Weir
Five seconds
You better hurry He 's engaged the override we ca n't open the inner door
Stay here Do n't stop working
What
What 's going on in there Starck
I 'm going outside to work on the Clark And Starck do n't tell anyone what you just told me We 've got enough to worry about
What I want is to survive the next ten hours
If you knew it was impossible then why 'd you waste my time
Starck do you know how crazy that sounds It 's impossible
We 're hanging on by our fingernails and you 're giving me bullshit stories
To what What are you saying This ship is alive
There was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged What if there were a connection between the two The gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system
I 've got a theory
I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin
Miller
Who
Maybe one of the original crew
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12 amylase proteins
What 's the point I 'll just get the same thing
I do n't know but whatever it is it 's not the crew
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing Bio-readings of indeterminate origin Right before that wave hit the Clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now it 's back to its previous levels
I thought of that with the filters from the Clark we 've got enough breathable air for twenty hours After that we 'd better be on our way home
It 's building up with every breath we take And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot
Oxygen is not the problem
The antennae array 's completely fried we 've got no radio no laser no highgain No one 's going to be coming to help us
It tastes bad
We 're all here
Keep your eyes open
There 's not enough radiation to throw off the scan I 'm picking up trace life forms but I ca n't get a lock on the location
Something 's wrong with the bio-scan
Crossing the horizon Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
I just finished drying
Let 's go
Justin
I 've seen bodies before This is different
About an hour ago In medical I saw my son He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were
No I saw nothing
Can you see a body
Yes we can see some kind of mist What is that
Dr Weir what 's this the door to
Here 's another one They 're all over the place
Claire
Was n't that ship destroyed
He 's been past Mars
Yes
I do n't care
You got any coffee
We have to do something oh God
Almost got it
Keep him talking
Can you shut it down
Not according to the computer
Hey You do n't need to be a scientist figure it out
I did n't see anything and I do n't have to see anything This ship is fucked
What
The safety circuit 's failed
What the hell is that
Foredecks Crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area Can we move in closer
Jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
Where is she
Hey
What if the air has gone bad We ca n't wear these suits forever
Get them back
Decompression would n't do that
What happened to his eyes
Range 500 meters and holding Turbulence is dropping off
The scope is lit it 's right in front of us
If they are they 're screening their calls
This is U.S Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark hailing Event Horizon Event Horizon do you read This is the Lewis and Clark hailing
You ca n't do that
30 hours to Neptune orbit
I ca n't believe this I have n't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit Why not Mars Cap Mars has women
Justin said something about The dark inside me What did he mean
The forward airlock
I 'm alright Please
It wants me I have to go
No there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind It 's as if time just stopped for seven years
I 'm sorry
It must be hard being so far away from her
Claire is your wife
Why Dr Weir I think you 're in love
That 's how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black hole 's immense gravitational power to create the gateway That 's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light
What is it
What is it
Could it be the crew If they were in suspended animation would n't that effect the scan
Do they have pressure
Wrong The shortest distance between two points
Well in layman 's terms you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
Relativity yes We ca n't break the law of relativity but we can go around it The ship does n't really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another light years away
We 're going to have to work on your touch
Those yours too
Relax it 's casual
I 'm blind not deaf Wan na come in
Trust me this ai n't one of those times
You would n't say that if you could see me
Tell me When you grew up in Brooklyn how many astronauts did you know You went your own way then You did n't listen to people So why start now
I would n't know anything about that
THING This ai n't permanent My friend Reed 's working on a cure I think
THING You know you could a run an ad in the personals
Where is Reed
It 's easy for you to be patient
It 's not him It 's them I ca n't live like this
What did he do to the uniform
He did n't
The suit will stretch You should try it
Well why did n't you say so You want me to lift some weights or something
Would n't want to keep Vic waiting
Is it safe
Victor did
I 'll schedule the launch Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
And you can Power it up
He also said we 'd avoid that storm in space And we know how that turned out
To help you I 've run every test known to man And they all yield the same result the machine is ready
Where do you think With Sue
Ben come in
About me How sweet
What are you doing here
What did you wish for honey
Oh my G-g-g What did you do to Ben
Do n't come any closer for a sec This is gon na be kind of a shock You remember when we said together forever no matter what
Out front You home baby I got a surprise for you
I do n't care about rocks I care about you You bring him back in one piece or you can forget being Best Man
Just get back soon or I start looking for a new groom
Forget it egghead I 'm good as is
Got it teach
Ben I do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse I need you to be patient for a little while longe
Yeah I can tell Victor was right
Oh you remember my name do you You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body
This is n't permanent Johnny We need to be careful until we 're normal again
O-kay We 'll skip that question

Okay I 've uh got some questions from Sue That she thought might be better coming from me Can you you know go to the bathroom like normal
You got a chisel round here
We had a tough year
Ben Are you okay
I think I need to lie down Bad shrimp
Well maybe you should date him
I 'm sorry did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws
Reed I 'm not talking about Debbie
You go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life
Reed Even you ca n't compute every little thing
Solid
How long was I out
I ai n't done arranging your flowers egghead
The shields on the station should protect us
This is your dream Reed You should be the one up there
Is n't that your speech
I had it at four
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do
They crashed it into a wall A flight simulator
No I can not take orders from that underwear model That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator
Ca n't do it I can not do it
We got what we wanted That 's enough
Ben think about all the people we can help if this works
Ben the money 's not important We could save lives
Ben This is business Just work
You 'd never know it
This was n't our first stop in case you forgot NASA And Victor 's not that bad He 's just a little Larger than life
Hey I 'm Mr Sensitivity now Clear the way wide load coming through
Really With a name like Von Doom Never saw that one coming
Go back to the drawing board
Give me the god damn mirror

Ben Ben
What about you
But Johnny you ca n't fly
What are you doing
I 'm sorry sis for leaving you guys
Look around sis She 's not here So you can stop talking to me like I 'm your little boy

Apparently I can disappear
The synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to
Front page
Make sure you find Ben bring him back here And keep it quiet I do n't need this to hit the press
Sir I 've always wondered Why Sue You could have any woman in the world but
You know maybe you should get some rest
Actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
Sir I 'm sure he would n't put himself
Stable We 're looking at low twenties It 's a good number considering the fallout from
Recording sir We see you perfectly
History Leonard History Everything else is conversation How 's the other matter
It 's not just the money I could make money in my sleep
Showtime
Reed 's always right Good thing he does n't always know what he 's got
If Reed 's right then this little trip will double our stock offering
I found a broken gasket from space
Sue I need some of that anger rage frustration
The power I need more power to control the storm
I can make it work
Why did n't you say something
I did I did Reed but I wanted you to be that man
I gave him twenty
Of course I was I 'd read all your papers on bioethics Some of them two times just so I 'd have something to say to you
Remember our first date here God I was so nervous
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter 's main power to generate enough voltage
Every variable but yourself You do n't eat sleep You ca n't live in your head like
Better than your life Victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing We are
Do n't let Victor push you into making a mistake
Reed How close are we to a cure
And you sure you can control this thing Last time did n't work out so well
But we 're the focus right Reed Reed
And reverse the mutations
The plants from space Their particles are still charged With the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm
No There were n't There was you And me No variables no math It was actually the simplest thing in the world But your head got in the way like it always does
I just wanted to share an apartment What was so complicated about that
Reed I was ready for the next step you were n't ergo I walked
Are you kidding
What in the world would give me that idea
I 'm sure I can come up with something
Anger Rage Frustration
Excuse me
What about you You have n't eaten in days How come you 're never on this side of the microscope
If it happened to him then it could
How come Ben ca n't turn it on and off like us
Sue Your clothes Lose them
What
It has to be the cloud It 's fundamentally altered our DNA
What What do you mean you
You are such a dork Reed You never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics
Passion
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
You always had a way with words I should be getting back
Yes thanks
Great minds think alike
Well he 's welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll You remember my brother Johnny
It 's been changed
Right That 's exactly what I meant
I was talking about us Working together
Never better
Which is precisely the point Analysis is over It 's time for action My men could have mass-produced this by now
What I should have done a long time ago Applications and patents Reed This all belongs to me
I do n't want to understand it This is n't one of your science projects I just want to fix it Fast
Abort Reed I put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and I will not let you make me look like a fool
Did n't go as planned It was a catastrophe You ruined the lives of four people
I 'm starting to wonder the same thing How much do you know about what happened to you
Ben did this
Just a little banged up A couple scrapes Why
Not until Ben is back inside
Come on Ben come on
Ben 's still out there
We 've got minutes until it hits not hours Victor that storm 's deadly the radiation 's lethal We need to abort
Got it So take a walk Ben I 'm going to borrow Susan for a second
Funny how things turn out is n't it
You back this mission and I 'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or
This is n't going to be a problem is it
But dreams do n't pay the bills do they Same old Reed the hopeless optimist Still reaching for the stars with the world on your back
Oh I think you already have
Then why is Reed dragging his feet Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass It 's ironic is n't it You 're finally the perfect woman for him because you 're his science project
Same old Reed All analysis no action Was n't that the problem with you two
Susan What are you doing
It is There 's something we need to talk about Something I need to ask you
Please no apologies I 've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos You 'll have round-the clock care

I thought he was out of town
Hey Doug Stallworth It 's his loss
I ca n't believe it But what about Doug
Dartmouth
But what are you going to do
Sometime
Not coming What happened
Where 's Doug
I want romance
You know Linda I 've finally figured it out It 's not sex I want Anyone can have sex
Another summer of working at Swenson 's
Do n't do anything Linda I 'd rather just forget about it I do n't even like the guy
I paid for it and everything
Then I called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father
I really thought he would show up I waited and waited and waited
You did n't tell me that they can be so nice so great but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they 're five years old
You know there 's one thing you did n't tell me about guys
I 'm not going to tell him He 's an asshole I hate him
It could be I had a pregnancy test at the clinic I 'll find out Monday I guess it was Damone
What do you think it is
I do n't know I just do n't feel right
I do n't know I 'm just so depressed Everything is just so depressing
God I do n't think so Better look in the house
I know He hates to have to wear uniforms
No
I think they 're both virgins
He works for the airline He 'll be out here You 'll meet him
I do n't know Thirty to forty minutes
Listen to this it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex but they do n't have real orgasms
Does that ever happen
All right Here 's another one 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together
Would n't penis and balls be the same category
Listen to this 'What are your mate 's three most erogenous zones
You really ought to look at this Linda There 's a drawing on every page and all these quizzes It 's like school
Sixteen
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre You know Mark Ratner
Stacy How many times do I have to tell you You are really going to be beautiful someday
Stacy What does it matter He 's a stereo salesman You want to marry him You want to have kids with him You want this guy to come home fifty years old and he 's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on Come on
Not since November
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like That 's why I 'm marrying him
Do n't you dare you 'll never hear from him again
Hey That 's my line
So tell me do you like Ron Is it serious
You 'll always remember your first time
Was it great
Just kidding About 10cc
Well I never did it
Like you know giving blow jobs
No there are variables that like I might not be good at
Yeah but they look more sophisticated You 'd probably think they 'd be better in bed
Do you think guys find that attractive
Linda That girl looks just like Pat Benatar
No way He just called him a dick
Believe it
If I did n't have a fiancé in Chicago I 'd go for it
Stacy what are you waiting for You 're fifteen I did it when I was thirteen It 's no huge thing It 's just sex If you do n't one of the other girls will
Face it With some guys you have to make the first move A lot of guys are just wussies
I called them If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer I 'd sit closer If I wanted to kiss him I 'd just do it You want Ron Johnson Grab him
Listen Stace you want to know about guys I 'll tell you They 're mostly chicken Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute I thought if I gave out a vibe they 'd get the message and call me up Well guess what They do n't call
Should we buy a frame for that
Just take his order look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny laugh a lot
Come on Stacy it 's your section and your man

Of course And now I have to get back to the news Send up some ice
Do n't worry You 're protected Just treat this poor woman like you 'd treat any other human being in trouble
Look you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again We 're watching her very carefully this woman has been into laudanum It 's a controlled experiment but I suspect we 'll need your cooperation before this thing is over
Crying Why was she crying
Tell me What do you want
IN VIETNAM ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION
WHAT What was that crazy bitch said to him There 's a war on man People are being killed
Holy shit
What 's the message My light is blinking
Do n't worry about a thing sir Just enjoy your stay
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible Can you have someone drive it around to the room
Listen you fuzzy little shithead I 've been fucked around in my time by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it 's MY turn Fuck you officer I 'm in charge here and I 'm telling you we do n't have room for you
Righto
Not for me
Look That telegram was all scrambled It was actually from Thompson not to him Western Union must have gotten the names reversed I have to get going I have to get out to the track
Of course But if I were you I 'd leave the Doctor alone until after he 's eaten breakfast He 's a very crude man
Awake What do you mean
You did the right thing Never try to understand a press message About half the time we use codes especially with Dr Gonzo
He is Do n't worry I 'll get it to him
Yes It makes sense
What
Hell no We 'd never hear the goddamn end of it
Cut their goddamn heads off Every one of them That 's what we 're doing in California
Naked
Naw That 's science fiction stuff
They 're everywhere Nobody 's safe And sure as hell not in the South They like warm weather You 'd never believe it In L.A it 's out of control First it was drugs now it 's witchcraft
Rum and ice please
What do you mean by that
Hell I really hate to hear this Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way sooner or later Mostly Atlanta But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance They did n't roam around much But now Jesus it seems nobody 's safe
Really
Naw Not a major
A major
And nobody did anything
What happened What did they do to her
They 'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives They might even sit on your wife 's chest Put the blade right down on her throat
You will One of these nights you 'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart
Do n't worry and I 'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County Just another good American like yourself
Oh my God
I know I 'm a triple Scorpio
Las Vegas
Wait a minute Come back and have a beer
Never mind Let 's get right to the heart of this thing Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel
I did n't think so Because in spite of his race this man is extremely valuable to me Hell I forgot all about this beer You want one How about some ether
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney He 's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip He 's a foreigner I think he 's probably Samoan But it does n't matter does it Are you prejudiced
Do n't take any guff from those swine Remember if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People
Ridiculous Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up You never saw me before Shit this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate You ready
Never missed a plane yet
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by burning the locals abusing the tourists terrifying the help The only chance now I felt was the possibility that we 'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it
Her eyes were turgid with fear but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level
I was stupid with shock not knowing whether to run or start laughing
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard
Fuck the car They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio
Alright Alice you 'll be contacted by Inspector Rock Arthur Rock He 'll be posing as a politician
I think we should put her on the payroll See what she comes up with
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY What happened What about the glands
then you 'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back
grow claws bleeding warts
Man your head would swell up like a watermelon you 'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours
Extract of pineal
Why not We should get some of that Just eat a big handful and see what happens
I know but the guy did n't have any cash to pay me He 's one of these Satanism freaks He offered me human blood said it would take me higher than I 've ever been in my life I thought he was kidding so I told him I 'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on
Never mind it 's absolutely pure
I remember slumping on the bed his performance had given me a bad jolt For a moment I thought his mind had snapped that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies But the room was quiet again
Hi Lucy Yeah it 's me I got your message what Hell no I taught the bastard a lesson he 'll never forget what No not dead but he wo n't be bothering anybody for a while Yeah I left him out there I stomped him then pulled all his teeth out
You wo n't need much Just a little tiny taste that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer Adrenochrome
Relax Let me handle this You 'd make a piss-poor lawyer Room 1600 please As your attorney I advise you not to worry Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit
OK goddamnit Look I 'll call her I 'll get her off our backs You 're right She 's my problem
Me
Lucy is looking for you
They 'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs
We keep it quiet It 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to talk about upstairs Not with the press around
Hurry up with those drinks We 're thirsty Only two rums Make mine a Bloody Mary
They were all veterans
and every one of them stacked naked
They just ran back out into Death Valley you know where Manson turned up
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald 's hamburger stand She was a waitress about sixteen years old with a lot of people watching too
Man you do n't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice
Right Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you 're partying with a thousand cops
Do n't mention that word around here You 'll get them excited
They 're actually nice people when you get to know them
Right Let 's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon I feel a powerful lust for red salmon
As your attorney I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe Also I told him I 'd be there myself in an hour and if she was n't I 'd come back out here and rip his lungs out
Okay Lucy it 's time to go meet Barbra
It just occurred to me that she has no witnesses Anything that she says about us is completely worthless
We have to cut her loose She 's got two hundred dollars And we can always call the cops up there in Montana where she lives and turn her in
You 'll go straight to the gas chamber And even if you manage to beat that they 'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy She 's got to go
In a few hours she 'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing uncircumcised member
I figure she can do about four at a time Christ if we keep her full of acid that 's more like two grand a day Maybe three
It 's straight economics This girl is a god-send Shit she can make us a grand a day
She 's perfect for this gig These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her We can set her up in one of these back street motels hang pictures of Jesus all over the room then turn these pigs loose on her Hell she 's strong she 'll hold her own
Well It 'll probably work out We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention
Lucy
WELL What are your plans
You degenerate pig
What Fuck telegrams I 'm in trouble You worthless bastard I 'll cripple your ass for this All that shit in the car is yours You understand that When I finish testifying out here you 'll be disbarred
You bastard I need a lawyer immediately
There 's no choice I would n't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife
Why not Hell just a minute ago you were asking me to kill you And now you want to kill me What I should do goddamnit is call the police
Why worry You 'll like it Nothing in the world like a Mace high Forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves
Are you ready
Do it I want to get HIGHER
BULLSHIT Do n't make me use this
Back the tape up I need it again Let it roll Just as high as the fucker can go And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME
I want that fucking radio
How about a check
OK But do me one last favor will you Can you give me two hours That 's all I ask just two hours to sleep before tomorrow I suspect it 's going to be a very difficult day
You 're doomed I 'm leaving here in two hours and then they 're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps Right there in that tub
What tape
You evil son of a bitch You better hope there 's some Thorazine in that bag because if there 's not you 're in bad trouble
Have you made a deal with him Did you put him on to her
What limes
Where 'd you get that knife
That little blonde groupie with the film crew You think he sodomized her
He told me he was turning in early
No we should leave the poor bastard alone I get the feeling that he 's avoiding us for some reason
What for
You drive I think there 's something wrong with me
Do n't go near that elevator That 's just what they want us to do trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement
Probably the bartender He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress
It wo n't stop It 's not ever going to stop
Do they pay you to screw that bear
I want to leave fast
Can we make it
No This is serious One more hour in this town and I 'll kill somebody
Yes Leave the country Tonight
I have to go
Please do n't tell me those things Not now This is my last drink How much money can you lend me
That 's what gives me The Fear
I hate to say this but this place is getting to me I think I 'm getting The Fear
Dogs fucked the Pope no fault of mine Watch out Why money My name is Brinks I was born Born
Where 's the ether This mescaline is n't working
We wandered into a fucking time capsule
Jesus creeping shit
Holy shit They almost had us there That was quick thinking
Why
Look what are we doing here Are we here to entertain ourselves or to do the job
Total control now Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible stoned ripped twisted Good people
I think he 's lying to us I could see it in his eyes
You bastard They 'll never let us back in that place I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around yelling about reptiles You scared the shit out of those people They were ready to call the cops Hell the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there
Not yet I want to study its habits
No no Do n't leave me
But what about our room And the golf shoes
If you think we 're in trouble now wait until you see what 's happening in the elevators
Lacerda
Thirty minutes It was going to be very close
How long do I have
You better be careful Plenty of vultures out here They 'll pick your bones clean before morning
Oh Jesus Did you see what god just did to us
Savage Henry has cashed his check We 're going to rip his lungs out
Pay no attention to this swine He ca n't handle the medicine
You scurvy shyster bastard Watch your language You 're talking to a Doctor of Journalism
The medicine Yes it 's right here
My heart
My attorney understands this concept despite his racial handicap But do you
and we 're chock full of that
We wo n't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit
O.K O.K yes Hang onto it We 'll be there in thirty minutes I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring What OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card Do you realize who the fuck you 're talking to
I tell you my man This is the American Dream in action We 'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end
God hell I think I see the pattern This one sounds like real trouble You 're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over As your attorney I must advise you that you 'll need a very fast car with no top and after that the cocaine And then the tape recorder for special music and some Acapulco shirts This blows my weekend because naturally I 'll have to go with you and we 'll have to arm ourselves
Or just think it Was I talking Did they hear me
If so well we 'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere Because it goes without saying that we ca n't turn him loose He 'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency and they 'll run us down like dogs
We 're your friends We 're not like the others
One toke over the line sweet Jesus
The password is One Hand Washes The Other The minute you hear that you say I fear nothing
You 're damn right But the first time you say anything about this to anybody you 'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life What 's your name
No I swear I 'm not
I know you 're cops but I thought you were just here for that convention I swear All I wanted to do was clean up the room I do n't know anything about dope
Nobody I 'm the maid
YOU 'RE UNDER ARREST
I 'll try I 've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time I 've heard a lot about it
How far is Baker I was hoping to stop there for lunch
A nap wo n't help I 've been awake for too long three or four nights I ca n't even remember If I go to sleep now I 'm dead for twenty hours
PATROLMAN That 's a strange attitude

Well you could always dump her Mr Bebe Teach her a lesson There are a million beautiful girls out there who do n't give a damn about politics
Excuse me sir
And on top of her political activities now she 's got a lawyer She wants out of her contract Mr Bebe She says she 's through with motion pictures
I guess so sir
Frances Farmer contract player six month option
Good morning Mr Bebe
Look Mr Bebe you can hold me to my contract but you ca n't break me I 'm back and I 'm gon na make the best of it
But I 'm the one up there on the screen
But I 'm concerned with everything Mr Bebe
Never mind that I 'm concerned about you Your attitude
Since we have you on a seven year contract I 'm planning long-range I 'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called Come and Get It
Thank you
You see We 've got to change that name
acts I 'll relay your message
I 'm sorry Frances It 's my job you know
That 's not all Frances Mr Bebe is very concerned about your politics He hears you 've been donating money speaking at rallies
You know what I mean
Yes but Really I hate to sound it 's just that the public expects something different from its stars People wo n't take you seriously
Yeah I mean slacks and work clothes and that awful car
Well I suppose I should just say it It 's your clothes
Hi Frances got a minute
Huh
Oh well I guess I better leave then
Thank you
What
God damn it Clifford will you shut up I tell you I want to give these things I want to give them to the audience and I can give them I will give them so shut up
I 'm not
I 'm not
He knows Frances
Right now we have to be practical
I know but
Yes That 's the deal She plays Lorna
An actress
What Good Lord no it 's just It 's money We needed backing and well we found it
Well well you see that 's the point You wo n't be opening in London
I hear you 're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract
Oh
Where 's Clifford
Hello Harold
Not only an artist but an instrument of change We must look to the world around us not content to observe but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy We contribute our profits for if fascism is not stopped in Spain it will spread across Europe jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive The artist to be vital must be a soldier too
Forgive my indulgence Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy The point is Mr Odets here has written a wonderful play Most of the roles are cast but we have n't found our female lead
The Group is more than a theatre company It 's the embodiment of an ideal Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense a creative individual and an instrument of change You see
GET OUT
You have no right You have no fucking right you bastards Get the hell out of here
I did n't make the law lady I just enforce it
Cool off beautiful Did n't you see the sign says Dimout Zone There 's a war on you know
Hey where 's the fire sister
The premiere I never pressed you about it but god damn it you 're gon na tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were
No It 's all about that night is n't it
I do n't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too that I might want to do theatre No 'cause you do n't want me along do you And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock
Dwayne I 'm Dwayne now And you damn well better get used to it
Hey I 'm not a complete fool you know I can see you 're going sour on me and when I try to do something about it you turn your back and say it 's nothing
You were n't going to tell me were you Just pack up and leave is that it
Without me
There was another call too From your agent He says your summer stock deal is all set So you 're going back east huh
Fired
Claire
Who
Sort of
Good 'Cause I do n't want to see you again
We 're all square now Harry Right
Harry
Let 's get out of here I 'll lose my job
Look at her She 'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow
Oh God Let 's get her out of here tonight right now Let 's take her with us
We 'll get you home Frances
One question If I 'm not myself now just who do you think I am
I see
You I 'm sorry forgive me Doctor tell me honestly what do I have to do to get out of here
No Cut this runaround Doctor I know better
Do n't you
Doctor it may sound odd but I believe I 've profited from my stay here It 's just what I 've needed to get away like this But I 'm recuperated now I 've had lots of time to think and I 've made a few decisions about my life I 'm ready to get on with it
TEACHER New York Frances Broadway This is your chance You belong on the stage
TEACHER Yes yes it 's all arranged Everyone 's collecting subscriptions in your name And the best part is the trip returns you to New York
TEACHER This is the answer a subscription drive to Voice of Action First prize is a trip to Moscow You could visit the art theatre maybe even meet Stanislavski
Thank you Ralph
Were you a drug addict
Were you an alcoholic
until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution Were you mentally ill Frances
Are you are you hungry
Please Francie
But I gave her my word Besides she 's still your legal guardian My hands are tied
They 'll just catch you again Francie Besides your mother will know
Francie you know I ca n't do that
I do n't care Dad I love you
Always Always
Well Francie sometimes after you get your hands on something you want it just does n't look the same Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it 's all you 've got or just let it go This is the way of things but I guess you already know that
What you have to understand Francie is that she well she wanted so much for herself too and for me and she never really got to The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers but she could have been if times were different she could have been a politician or I do n't know
I do n't know honey Your mother has such big plans for you
Be careful Francie
Then go
And you think it 's worth all this
You really want to go
Francie you 'll learn that sometimes it 's best to stay low and just walk away
And I ca n't understand how it can hurt to be honest but the more I tried to explain
It 's already started Dad with me
No no no All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation
Yeah well it 's possible Harry York and I both work for Mr Kaminski right now and well There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break That 's the way of things but Mr Kaminski wants to change it and when it comes to new ideas the people in power get nervous
Well Harry York is a guy who well he does a lot of things Why do you ask
You wrote it did n't you
An essay contest a national contest That 's pretty impressive
I 'm I 'm really proud of you Frances
Bye baby
Do n't make me sick I 'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound
As usual Everything as usual Mr Farmer Just give me my due
Good
That 's right I ca n't understand a man who puts strangers over his family a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure
How What do they do for you Kaminski and his friends They 're all anarchists Traitors
You 've sacrificed If you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents
You 're poisoning that child 's mind
Thank you
I can thank you for that It was a hard-earned talent
CHIEF Oh Angela my own Angela
CHIEF No No arguments Be my good girl and go There 's a forest a burning forest and you know what I have to do
CHIEF Oh Angela Go with these trappers They 'll lead you safely down the mountain

I 'll have someone show you to your room
Stay calm please
Just a little joke Miss Farmer
All right Will you please sit down now Symington says
And what 's that
I see
Please sit down
Among persons such as yourself creative people under great stress erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of It 's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which
Why Doctor We 've only just met
It ai n't for lack of trying
Aw shucks ma'am T'were n't nothin
Am I supposed to say 'thank you
Good Because Brothers that 's you
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future and the future of your children
And do you think it 's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family
NURSE What
NURSE You 're kidding
NURSE Yeah
Build for him a pyre Light up the sky with his passing
I 've never been shown a kindness Show me one now
Then why weep for him
You drove him to his torment
What is that to you Evil as you are
I was watching
You were with him at the end
People can be kinder than you think
Why do you not go to them
Friends Do they live around here
You 're an outcast
It ca n't be as bad as that
Why
I 'm glad you finally came to the door A man should n't have to scurry in the shadows
Nice
GET AWAY FROM HER SHE 'S MINE
She 's not for you
That is mild compared to what will come If you deny me my wedding night I 'll be with you on yours
You will honor your promise to me
What does it matter She 'll live again You 'll make her
A brain Extremities
Her body pleases me
I 'll be waiting And watching
Soon
And if I consent
Like you Oh God you do n't know what you 're asking
Friend
What can I do
I do n't know
Trace memories in the brain perhaps
You 're wrong Do you know I knew how to play this
What of my soul Do I have one Or was that a part you left out Who were these people of which I am comprised Good people Bad people
Why Victor Why What were you thinking
I see it before me
How dare you You 're disgusting and evil
Fine words from a child killer You who murdered my brother
Then why am I here What did you want with me
Kill me and have done with it
How did you find me
You speak
Fine
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it We 'll say it came today It 'll set his mind at ease
Elizabeth If it 's true travel into Germany would be banned You 'd never get near Ingolstadt Besides they 're only rumors
So have I
It 's been months It 's not like him
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a pompous Fellow
And you look so lovely
One-two-three one-two-three twirl two-three
Elizabeth really He 's quite mad
That 's the nature of all progress William Do n't let your brother sway you otherwise
Poor William What indignant tears
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time They say he never arrived
Have you seen Willie
What does it say
He always was opinionated
Victor
I remember the first time I ever saw you Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side So beautiful even then
Brother and sister no more
Victor tell me why Trust me
Does this have something to do with that man you saw
It is
Why the change What about your work
A month at most that 's all I ask Elizabeth please Things have not yet resolved I must take steps to see that they do For our family 's sake For our sake You are life itself We shall seal our vow The moment I am done
So do I
It 's not something I can explain now Perhaps someday
I 'm all right I 'm safe
I know only that he is a killer And I shall bring back his carcass
They 've done a fine job Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend
I 've no choice
My mind was not playing tricks He was there in the storm gloating over his crimes challenging me to come
Victor I love you
I give you my soul
Our decision Together
You make me weak
Only you
Then come with me to Ingolstadt Marry me now
I wish to be your husband
Is that what makes it so delicious
All my life I 've known
To be the best there ever was To push our knowledge beyond our dreams to eradicate disease and pestilence to purge mankind of ignorance and fear
I 'll have to do better than that
And you
Quite a send-off is n't it
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies Make yourself heard Willie Learning to walk is not an easy thing Why should it be so
The world is a dizzying place
He left a beautiful gift in her place A baby boy To cherish and love as our very own Your brother
She was mother to me as well But ours is the job of the living It 's up to us now to hold this family together We must think of Father and be strong for him I can not do that alone
It 's not ours to decide All that live must die It 's God 's will
Nothing can Not ever
Are n't you
Aye Captain
This ice will break yet How 's our guest
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny
Captain I implore you The men are frightened and angry They want your assurance
It 's going to ram us
Professor
No But someday
I 'm convinced Not by treating symptoms but by diving nature 's most jealously-guarded secrets
I 'm quite serious Look at all the charity and clinic work we do Up until thirty years ago the concept of vaccine was unheard of
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave By my hand
Only if you 'll tell me who he is
Yes do n't worry I 'll look after your father You look after her
I did n't find what I was looking for
This My home My family If not for you I 'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere
Thank you Henry
Victor This place looked like a charnel house What went on here
It 's the down-and-outs I pity most Those who ca n't fend for themselves They 'll be dead by the thousands before this is done They do n't stand a chance out there
Everything in moderation Clerval
You 've been going round-the-clock
Is that your diagnosis
A week
You 'll be leaving then Just as well You never were cut out for this Henry Goodbye
Yes And
This is a bad time Henry I 'm busy just now What do you want
How much longer
We all know how hard you took Waldman 's death Even Krempe is sympathetic But it is time to move on It is time to concern yourself with life
Victor This has got to stop Nobody 's seen you in months You have n't attended a single class
No He had more important work
Blasphemy be damned Waldman spent his life trying to help people
I resent God 's monopoly
Why Waldman He of all people should have cheated death
It was wrong Henry It should n't have happened The bastard deserves to die
Good I 'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance
Nothing in moderation Clerval
Somebody has to
But you have n't listened Never in history has so much seemed possible We 're on the verge of answers undreamt of but only if we have the courage to ask the questions
These are exciting times Henry We 're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs Look at Edward Jenner He was n't content to bleed people with leeches he pioneered a new frontier of thought
It 's a letter to my father
You 're a comfort to me Henry
Do me a favor then keep them to yourself
Can you think of a better reason
Come now Magnus Agrippa Next thing you know you 'll be teaching toadstools to speak
I know You have a way of making an impression
Henry Clerval
Are you having me on
I am not mad
I was just clearing my throat
So you have claimed Yet you have no explanation for this The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder The locket you so coveted How did it come to be in your possession
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion
And is it true Miss Moritz that you love Victor Frankenstein That your heart was broken Answer the question Do you love Victor Frankenstein
Despite the lack of challenge
Of Geneva Tell me Mr Frankenstein of Geneva Do you wish to study medicine Or mysticism
What is your name
Paracelsus
Philosophical
In science the letter of fact is the letter of law Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect Someday you may be priests but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse Any questions
I tell you what we need my friends Forget the symptoms and diseases What we need is a vaccine for death itself
Victor He was trying to be gracious
Re-configure the leads
Why
Nonsense Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe
It is a thrilling direction to explore Thrilling and dangerous Nature can be wonderful and terrible Science is not a realm for the reckless it needs a conscience We must proceed cautiously Assess as we go What I do on my own time is my own business The same holds true for you You wish to expand your mind Fine do so You can even join me here if you like But not at the expense of your normal studies
Why God alone knows what it means Until it has proven value it 's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick Hardly fit for the classroom
Electricity
Preposterous
You disdain accepted wisdom
You have a way of provoking his I 've been watching you You seem impatient with your studies
Victor explain yourself
My name is Frankenstein
We are kindred you and I Men of ambition Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man
Do you share my madness
You 'd persist at the cost of your own life The lives of your crew
Your men are right to be afraid
Creature A human like creature
I heard
Ah An explorer
How is it you come to be here
Frostbite Gangrene A simple diagnosis
You 're awake I 've prepared some broth It 'll help restore you
VOORHEES We should go now
The killer is still out there
VOORHEES So young so pretty What monster could have done such a thing
VOORHEES It 's just this place The storm That 's why you 're all upset
VOORHEES It will be all right I 'll take care of you

I do n't believe you
God but I love that macho talk Emergency generators The Indian used campfires
Wait wait When I was finding these goodies in the shed I also found this letter which a camper never sent home Listen
Coach athletic director somewhere
Quote Controlled substances are expressly forbidden Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal Unquote

To keep the daylight out This is where they sleep Get to the door
Thank you son
It 's not suicide if you 're already dead Two

Have you forgotten about your sister
I 'm gon na try and get us across the border
I have no idea
Lie in the back Dad I 'll drive us into Mexico
Why do you want to stop
Unless you two wiseacres wan na be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking what say we drop this
We got about two more hours of day light left That 'll get us into El Paso which is right next to the border We 'll stop at a motel
I promise
I do n't give a shit about living or dying anymore I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can
My guess is that this little dive 's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks
You bet your sweet ass you are and I 'm gon na help you do it But we ai n't got much time
Yep

Yeah I know what 's going on We got a bunch of fuckin vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin blood That 's it plain and simple And I do n't wan na hear any bullshit about I do n't believe in vampires because I do n't fuckin believe in vampires either But I do believe in my own two fuckin eyes and with my two eyes I saw fuckin vampires Now does everybody agree we 're dealin with vampires
Forever together

If he touches her I 'll kill him I do n't give a fuck how many guns you have nothing will stop me from killing him
You wo n't let him touch her
No I did n't
Yes
You want me to sit here and be passive The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you 'll let us go I 'm not there yet You have to convince me you 're telling the truth
How do I know you 'll keep your word
Yes
I think I 've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I 'm gon na get Now if you need me like I think you need me you 're not gon na kill me 'cause I wo n't answer your stupid prying questions So with all due respect mind your own business

There 's nothing wrong with this place
What do you think Mom would say
That happens you 'll get it back
It 's just all our lives you 've been a pastor For twenty years you 've preached trust in the lord And then one day you wake up and say fuck him
I did n't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset But you do n't believe in God anymore
Dad when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist Mr Franklin said he would n't permanently replace you until we came back He said when we come home if you still feel the same way
I just bet you would Do n't even think about it Besides I want to have one night 's sleep in an honest to-goodness bed The beds in the home are okay but they 're not like a real bed
You two ought to start a stand-up act because you 're just wasting your humor on me

Feel this real wood paneling That 's real wood too not that fake stuff

CHASE I would say that 's a very safe assumption
CHASE This ca n't be confirmed at this time but we do believe it to be true We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store 's clerk
CHASE We 've received no news one way or the other We can only hope for the best
CHASE Yes it does Kelly We have already alerted the Mexican authorities They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice
CHASE For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours The Bureau local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko
Yeah and I 'm gon na be right back at it tomorrow So tonight I 'm gon na sit in front of the box and just drink booze How much is the bottle
They 'll probably make a run for the border which would bring 'em this way And if we get our hands on those shit asses we 're talking payback time We 'll get 'em all right I got ta piss I 'm gon na use your commode
That 's all that 's been on the box all day They killed some people did n't they
You could sue the shit out of her ya know That kid belongs under a circus tent not flippin burgers You could own that fuckin place

Administration Ensign Blondell
But are there I mean how many
The woman I saw you with
I do n't know if there 's any single reason But my father was Navy And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den It showed a girl trying on a sailor 's uniform while saying Gee I wish I were a man I 'd join the Navy Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it and even then it felt wrong Made me mad And I do n't think a month has gone by that I have n't thought about that poster Gee I wish I were a man
Who 's we
That 's what I hear
No problem lieutenant
B.O.Q south side Take a starboard tack out the door
Of course but there 's more
Uh V.I.P security arrangements generally take some time Senator
Standing right here in my office
Your prerogative Senator
Are you truly mouthin off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee I mean I 'll give you points for style just nothin for smarts
and now I got reporters from Toadsquat Iowa calling my office and askin what I know about this G.I Jane thing
Commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill These were supposed to have been discreet test cases
Sir What did he say
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there
Sir If tomorrow I was not under your command would the inquiry still go forward
Sir please if there 's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud
I 'm saying we 're just friends
I do n't know of any delicate way to say this lieutenant so I wo n't try Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization of the same-sex variety Specifically that you were seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming
Permission to leave sir
Sir I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this Not this article not
See me sir
So I 'll get a fair shot
Would n't dream of it sir
Across the board sir
Same rules for everyone sir
The shape does n't bother me It 's just that goddamn rotten stench
No sir
I think you 've resented me from the start sir
Pardon
I ca n't afford civility sir How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you 've got me set up as an outsider Even if I make it under these rules I still lose because there 'll always be a flag in my file Yeah she made it but I mean really why did n't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base
It 's this double-standard the separate quarters the deferential treatment It 's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met
It 's you sir And it started the day I came here
Did n't take long
If you were like everyone else lieutenant I suspect we would n't be making statements about not making statements would we Take your leave
Then that 's all I have to say Dismissed
I 'm not out to change your sex lieutenant You 'll have separate beds separate heads If you have specific medical needs inform the infirmary If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately Questions
Do n't worry about it If it 's off your collar and out of your eyes that 's all I 'm going to ask
Thank you sir But I expect a certain amount of pain

'S AIDE Not that The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would in one stroke void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
'S AIDE Did you hear
'S AIDE Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing They 'll never know whose leak it is
I 'll act surprised
That aside for the moment I 'm struck by the tenor the ill-spirit of your report the degrading remarks by other aviators innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior In my seven years on this committee I 've never seen a downed aviator treated like this Never I 'm deeply disturbed by this report Mr Hayes Not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well
I 'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything Mr Hayes
Yes I see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else 's And your conclusion was pilot error hmm
The Navy 's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier Female aviator it just so happens You 're familiar with this report and its conclusion am I right
The Lark Report
Hardly the case Senator
last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service particularly in the land-based maritime specialties What 's more the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on
You know I wonder what the SecNav would think about it If I spoke with him
I 'm sure it is
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket too
I wanted the choice The chance to prove myself my skills my work me That 's how it should 've been
So the rhetoric gets you headlines But the reality gets you in trouble
You were never going to let women serve in combat You always had a safety net Or thought you did
What are you saying That a women 's life is more valuable than a man 's That a women 's death hurts a family more
You do n't know that
So Is n't the President jumping on your bandwagon
Should probably ask him that
Wickwire was there to help To be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot At least that was the intent
Did you set me up Did you set me up just to see me fail
It should You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me
You know him
Jordan I always hoped we 'd get together though just now I 'm gearing up for a child-care vote that
Uh ma'am
Ca n't complain ma'am
Would I be the only one The only woman
Uh question ma'am
Captain Dwyer Technically
I know that sir Ma'am It 's just that Beggin your pardon Senator but do you understand that this involves combat training
Coronado
Thank you ma'am Um may I ask what this is regarding
G.I Jane And which one of you told me she would n't last a week Huh
What the hell is the President trying to do Steal DeHaven 's thunder
Then I suggest we start there
So she picks the women we pick the programs Seals
Six o'clock Marking marking
Close as I can get el-tee
Really do n't wan na be captured el tee Heard some bad things
Hey You okay Flea
I 'll work on it ma'am
No ma'am
It 's really F Lee Montgomery but that gets whittled down to just Flea For short ma'am
JOHNS You 're wanted at the C.O 's
JOHNS O'Neil
Come on Montgomery
Just do it okay
I can make this wall without
CHIEF I think you probably would if you did n't know I was right
CHIEF Of course it is And I 'm gon na stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing that real lives are gon na be lost Maybe mine maybe yours
CHIEF She 's an officer There 's a higher standard
CHIEF I 've had it Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter does n't mean I 'm gon na be one
CHIEF You do n't think she 'd be raped if she were captured You do n't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men
CHIEF Boat Five Wickwire Cozad Vinyl Intagliata Ayers and Wise Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer Follow his orders to your death
PYRO Miller Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium Really did n't expect to lose him
PYRO Time
Just a coincidence
I was looking for him earlier but
The Navy Cross
PYRO Automatic five-second deduction which slips you under the wire It 's called gender-norming O'Neil standard procedure for all females in physical training courses Where you been the last few years
I 'll try anyway sir
Thank you sir But I like these just fine
Which is guy-speak for
So here we are again Staring three years of operational duty in the face
I 'd sure like to know who
Wickwire Thomas Dane Second run at Coronado and correct they had him stashed in the Appropriation Liaison Office whatever that is
What
Well pardon me if I do Now who else Who could 've leveraged a class officer like that C'mon Jordan keep your head in the game
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy
Instructors typically pull three year assignments This guy 's in and out in one year your year That sound right
John James Urgayle The Chief
I 'm tired of fighting back I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay
It 's done with Royce Let it go
The Chief Or maybe even Turrentine Your C.O
Almost like someone put him up to it Okay who
And this class officer Wickwire You think he was just trying to get even Striking back for
Sure I 'll join the crowd
Still ca n't make up your mind huh Got ta go Royce
Well let me warm you I 'm going though with this The more everybody fucks with me fucks with my head the more it just makes me want to finish So do n't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon okay
You know Royce I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too
So why are you telling me this
I saw an article
Me Why me
I feel like there 's men here there 's women here then there 's men But hey what 'd I expect
How hard they making it on you
I 've been trying you for five days Do n't they give you messages
Jordan
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth But I 'm trying to be honest okay Three years is a long time Do n't ask me to predict how I 'll feel then Jordan because I do n't know And either do you
I do n't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life Jordan Maybe we should just let it happen
I 'll try to keep the door open If you wash out I make it so that
You 're such a ball-breaker sometimes Especially at night
Well guess I do n't even need to be here
So dump on me
She 's haze grey and underway
Well you 're doin shit-hot at Intel
Spec-Recon Those guys are world class warriors And they will not want you there Jordan
So why 're you even considering it Are you
By the way I 'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here
Hate this part Just sweating it out on the sidelines
Thank you sir We hear back from the Pentagon
Only four minutes to neutral waters sir Why not
Quick-hit technique used by Capone Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride Check the files DPRK-57 I doped it out as a contingency plan Seal Team infiltrates picks up the package links up with recovery sub But do n't waste time opening and closing hatches They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters
Unless you Whiskey Run
North Korean beaches are the best protected most heavily monitored in the world The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system Extraction team has to be small and silent I 'd go with Seals over Delta Force Problem is do n't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice Where 's The Polk
Chances of recovery
Do we know it 's him using the beacon Not a decoy
Got ta situation here Where are you Stuck in traffic
This is insane You 've got no proof
Okay Well thought I 'd ask
Sure sure
Thanks for lying But you 're the class officer Wick and it 'd just be weird if we hook up Besides
I ca n't go out Not like this
First big night of liberty and no date You 're pathetic Wickwire
Sorry did n't mean to
Last time I did n't
O'Neil
You got anybody Wick
He was married

They had to kill 'em
If you got a good one Wick
You really came back for more Of this
Wick They got your crew too
Who is it
Hey Way to gut it out
I did n't know they let you try again Especially at your age
And how do you know that
Whose orders were those
Well now I feel so much better
Grab an oar find a way to weight it down we 're gon na need it Cortez help him Flea You take one of the two full minis and just follow my lead
So we got two full mini-tanks three minutes each 'Cool How much air in yours

CHIEF Well I 'm trying to figure out if you 're stupid unlucky gluttonous or some new alloy of all three
Sure Just like your men do
CHIEF I 'm so glad we agree
CHIEF Do you
We did n't know we were compromised Firing would only 've given away our position
I think you 're the liar
That 's not right
No Yes I mean depends on
CHIEF She led us right to you That 's no threat
CHIEF Why did n't you shoot the woman O'Neil
Should I be afraid
Green Eggs and Ham You 're not going to get anywhere You might as well put me in the cage
Dick Jane and Spot
Dad
CHIEF You were commissioned one month earlier which makes you the senior officer Remember There are no bad crews only bad leaders
CHIEF England went out with a stress fracture That puts you in charge lieutenant
CHIEF Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion Men fight better without women around And that is an historical fact
I see So when a man tries to rescue another man he 's a hero But when he tries to rescue a woman he 's gone soft
Sir someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross May I ask what you got it for
Permission to get dressed sir
Chief sir I do n't understand why
Say again sir
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard
You do n't suppose this is just part of
I just wonder how that happened
Sure Now she wants to shoot
North

Well I can be tough if I want
Animal you do n't think that 's true do you
I like that image
Who was that French guy anyway
You 'd be surprised
Are you okay
If the military are listening they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape
The network is on an intranet It 's a direct feed into our computer system
How do you know
I know a way I know how you can get a message out of here
I was wrong
What are you doing here
I did n't mean for it to turn out like this Look I lied to you I 'm not a reporter When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I 'd make it But I have n't That 's why I needed this story so bad I just could n't tell you I 'm a failure
You never said it was off the record
Is this cause of me Because of the story
Nesting
I do n't get it If it 's the first of its kind how can it be pregnant
Are you sure
What else do you know about it
Blood sample How close did you get to that thing
And you think this creature is one of them
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect
I still ca n't believe it How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Wait I 'm sorry You 're right Eight years is a long time Can I offer you a cup of tea
Most people do n't
You just left me without a phone call a letter nothing All this time Yeah I guess I 'm still a little mad
No I 'm into earthworms now You would n't be interested They 're real boring creatures Very reliable dependable no surprises
Yeah well
What
It 's good to see you Nick
You must have quite some harem
I 'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity Luce If there 's a story here I 'm going to find it
Wish me luck
Yeah well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama There 's a story here I know it You got any tape or glue
Remember my friend we saw on t.v
That 's the problem He did
Nick Tatopoulos
He was my college sweetie Look at him He looks so handsome on t.v What the hell is he doing in Panama
It 's Nick I know that guy I know him
I ca n't believe he put the moves on me After everything I 've done for him
My life sucks
And I 'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman 's expense p.o 's
Five bucks
What do I get
What 's it to you
Not anymore Mr Caiman I quit
We I do n't think so

I 'm sorry about all this
Evacuate Manhattan That 's over three million people Has that ever been done before
Hence the radiation
Well I think you 're cute
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart
Really A girlfriend then
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl How did Mrs Tatopoulos handle it
Hi Nick Tatopoulos
They did n't make it
We 've secured the doors on both levels
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten
Merde
ANDERSON And how should we do that Sir
ANDERSON Only five Sir We 've checked them all He has n't used any of them
ANDERSON When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone
Major what do you think could have done this
That is our job
CHARGEURES property and casualty insurance We are preparing a report
HICKS Who are they Lieutenant get those people away from there
HICKS You gave them the tape
HICKS So after we kill the creature we 'll begin a search for the nest
Um excuse me sir but the situation 's more complicated than that The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has
Well yes I did Clearly he was injured and bled
HICKS What are you suggesting
What do we know It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years
The radiation is not an anomaly it 's the clue This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur
Somebody must have seen it
But there 's no animal in the world that can make prints like that Is there
That was a footprint I was standing inside a footprint
What sample
They 're enormous A new species created by man 's recklessness That 's what I 've been trying to tell you I 'm only a biologist I take radioactive samples and study them
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before Mutated by seventeen percent
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm 's DNA You have any idea what that means
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm
Look I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field
You did n't answer my question In fact for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions
Excuse me would you mind telling me what the hell I 'm doing here
It 's Tatopoulos
You do n't have the authority to do that
That thing 's dead What the hell are we waiting for
Do you have any idea what 's going on out there The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city
Last time you did n't even scratch it
But you do n't know for sure
Wait Au revoir
I understand
It 's Raymond
It 's okay I know her
I ca n't get through I do n't know what 's wrong
555-7600 Tell them it 's a code dragonfly They should get you through
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape
I think we should leave now
Three eggs I thought there would be more
They 've turned off the ventilation system They 're calling him to dinner
What 's with the chewing gum
So you 're in
Yes This testing done by my country left a terrible mess We are here to clean it up
It is my job to protect my country Sometimes I must even protect it from itself From mistakes we have made Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about
I am a patriot I love my country Can you understand that
So why all the secrecy Why are n't you guys working with the US military
How did you get all of this stuff into the country
Oh my bags I 've checked them in

Yes sir Marvelous is n't it Completely distractionless
Yes sir Your quarters sir

Damn you Damn you
I wo n't and nothing you say
Friend You stole all my best lines You cut me out of episode two entirely
As a matter of fact I do Look at their eyes They 're obviously nocturnal Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31
This is ludicrous Why are you listening to this man Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume not a uniform He 's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow No offense
And note the sucked in gut
You think you could do better Laredo

My cousin 's boyfriend 's sister went out with the screenwriter His favorite movie is the Omegaman He 's seen it 13 times
No I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer but a matter REARRANGER converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past
It 's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years Many believe that is a matter collapser a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds
Well that 's the big question is n't it
Yes Commander
Okay that 's where you want to be
Okay so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT Should be down at the far end to your left
Commander do you have a camera I 'd die to see this in person All they showed on T V was a machine here and a wall here I do n't know why they did n't show the whole thing
Okay Okay now what
Okay you can go on in I 'm going to get Kyle He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive

A hologram
Hey Commander Listen we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion What do you think
I 'm just a glorified extra Fred I 'm a dead man anyway If I 'm going to die I 'd rather go out a hero than a coward
Listen I 'll go in create a distraction have this may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape
Of course We 'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor

Let 's just pick up the pace a little shall we
All right let 's all settle down If we 're going to get through this we 're going to have to exercise self control
No Nobody does Do you know WHY Because my character Is n't IMPORTANT enough for a last name Because I 'm going to DIE five minutes in why bother to come up with a last name for me
Yeah what is it

Turn on the translation circuit
Nothing Hold please
Jason we 're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there
Thank God Are you okay
Jason Can you hear me
Clenched jaw
How does the rolling help actually
All right here 's the plan First Fred we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound then Gwen Alex Fred and I go down to get the sphere Any of those things come back give a signal Guy you set up a perimeter
You 're playing your good side
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me
Computer do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard
Computer can it be repaired
No I do n't think so Wait They 're not but Something is Oh my god
I do n't think that 's a cloud
Listen Sarris you ca n't blame me for trying
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture You nodded okay
JASON
Jason
Mathesar maybe we should get some of your crew up here
Let me think I need time to think
Gwen Gwen c'mon wait no
Hey Hey where are you going
It 's not the STUFF I mean anybody can learn the STUFF The important thing is COMMITMNT 99 of anything is just committing to it
Are you kidding I 'm not going to tell them
Tell them About
C'mon we 're wanted up on the command deck
But I 'm the Commander
Let me try Computer Computer
One minute I 'm Hey I 'm dressing
You know it 's one thing to treat us this way but how can you do this to your fans
You smiled at me
What do you want me to say Gwen They wanted the Commander
A few fans built a little set in their garage I come in for an hour at most It 's a nothing
Tommy look Those lights
Closer I can try
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now
Wait Fred what about your thing you know Digitize me Sergeant Chen
We got the Sphere but the Commander 's down there with a bunch of cannibals Teb reset the pod we 're going back
Oh my god Tommy Stop the pod Stop the pod
I have ONE job on this lousy ship It 's stupid but I 'm going to DO it GOT IT
I do n't know guys I mean he almost looked sincere I know it 's bizarre
Do n't do it Tommy He 's not worth it
Almost as much as he loves himself
You are so full of shit
Tomorrow morning before the store opening
This is great They 're going to start eating each other out there
This is embarrassing really I sha n't tell this story when I return home
Yes You understand THAT do n't you Mathesar
Simpler
Our dimwitted friends do n't understand the concept of acting They have no theater no imagination these scientists
Gwen The show There 's no choice Do it
Please do n't hurt them it 's not their fault I 'm not the Commander I do n't know anything
Do you think I 'm a fool That the Commander does not know every bolt every weld of his ship
Prepare a tear harness for the female
Is it a bomb A booby trap Tell me
Then tell me one thing What does it do the device The Omega 13
All right You got it You win I 'll deliver it now Just give me a moment to set it up
Listen I 'd like to but frankly I 'm not even sure where it is or even
Right Well Listen I 'm I 'm sorry about that whole thing before It was kind of a misunderstanding I 'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people How 's the uh that going to heal up God I hope so I feel just awful about that
Yes Hi Sarris How are you doing
First I require the Omega 13 Second
The ship is a model As big as this A very clever deception indeed He oa n't oontaln hIs lauchter A belle TOMMY Set a course for home lommander
But Why
But Inside I have seen
But there it is
We have become aware of these concepts only recently In our dealings with Sarris Often Sarris will say one thing and do another Promise us mercy and deliver destruction It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris
Deception Lies
You what What are you talking about
It 's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185
Mathesar I need you to prepare pods for my crew
I 'm sorry You deserve to be shown
Our former Commander was not Strong
NO Thank God he has not
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars we 'll be there this fine ship this fine crew Never give up never surrender
Maintenance facility
Weapons storage
How can we thank you Commander You You have saved our people
An interstellar vox
He has a very powerful ship Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
But what if Sarris survives
Theramin
But Commander The negotiation You You You fired on him
You You mean Earth
Commander Where are you going
Mind If we skip that I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys
Oh right The thing with the thing Come on in I 'll get some pants on
Catch me later okay
Right If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent but make sure I have a limo from my house they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I 'm trying Commander Everything 's a blur but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal
Mark 20 Into the black hole areao
Let 's do it Tommy
Pedal to the metal Tommy
Jason What about me What do I do
We 've got to get out of here C'mon hurry
It 's a ROCK It does n't HAVE vulnerable spots
It does n't have eyes
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard
Okay On what
Sorry Guys It just went off
Oh right sorry
Okay I 'll do this Caw Caw
What kind of signal
Oh god
Push It Hold it down
It 's as far as it goes
Just GO GO DAMMIT PUNCH GO
Why do n't you just turn it on and see
They designed the ship from watching you So Take her out Lieutenant
I think we 're going to exit the space port
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector I can show you on a map
That 's right Just keep shaking it out Here have some gum It helps
to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies and plenty of them
You said we do appearances together or not at all
Because they 're coming right at us
Get oacK on their tail
Find them
Find them
Lieutenant Lathe I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself Chasing across the universe to obtain what is I am now certain a bauble of fiction Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel I would like nothing to remain
Continue forward sir
I 'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property
Unfortunately I 'll never get the chance I 'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion Wasting my time naturally Look at her teasing those bumpkins
Hmmm she 's beneath me I 'm afraid
They always say that
Cut those men down Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial Benedict trust me to handle this
You go too far Benedict
Could n't you have appealed to Congress
The point being he 's also a candidate for my job If we can pull this off maybe I can restore their faith in me
Have you heard The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee
As soon as the men have good shelters I 'll move Perhaps Martha will join me this winter
There 's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships And that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God Benedict it says that I have gone mad
They 're ready Believe me the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything Of course we get nothing from Congress They need boots coats we desperately need food
While they 're strung out
I You all know my history
Well truth be told I was a pharmacist Alexander
After visiting Congress I know what it 's like being violated by come disproportionate asses Ah if she only knew that the most important men in the country possibly the world are sitting at this table
I hope I never have to believe that
Then I need you We all do Without your victory the men would have no hope at all
The army needs you
What do you think George shall I resign It 's what they want
Is that a fact
Go on I want to hear everything
We 're in bad shape Benedict moral is low Before I can do anything I need Lee and his seven thousand troops I 've ordered him to join us three times In my last letter I all but begged him to come here The man is insubordinate
They do n't trust me that 's the truth is n't it Sam Adams never did
Why in hell would John do that Why in hell would any of them do that After all you 've done it 's unbelievable
Damn-it You 've given us a whole new season Benedict And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring Now half their army is back in Canada
Arnold
Ben Franklin 's going to Paris but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns Our troops are mobs they wo n't take orders have no equipment could they beat the British
They died well Otherwise they did n't do much right But if we have war the British will surely send their best troops right now they have no other enemies
What 's your frank estimation of the British
You seem pleased by the prospect
You 'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness
Patience Colonel Arnold Active personalities terrify these men But congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga
LEE Well general I think I ai n't got no school learning I ai n't got no trade and I 'm a drunk So I think there ai n't much left to be set free
LEE I ai n't forgot about the freedom
You 'd have money every year so you would n't have to work You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want
Wil I 'm giving you your freedom Do you understand
You 've served me loyally year after year without complaining I 've thought hard about you this past winter I want to free you Wil I want to give you your freedom after this battle is fought
Wil
LEE Me You apologizing to me
What What are you talking about
Misunderstood what
None of the servants is to touch a gun You know that
You are never never to touch my guns Do you understand
Tell Mrs Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer
I do n't know what color is what officer my lord
Because they have hardly any uniforms they designate officers with colored ribbons My lord
Many of them many did not possess proper arms My lord
Yes my lord
No my lord
Marquis Get these men reformed send Steuben and Wayne out on the left
Who is that
LEE The British These men can not stand against them
Lafayette will not be happy
LEE More than that sir my orders from Congress
You 're asking me to be president of a republic not king Not a dictator over subjects
But it 's more than just that am I right
I 'm not sure
Well if it 's my last order then I order them to be there Tell them I will give them my decision then
I want to address the officers all the officers Next Friday Can we arrange it at the mess
What 's your advice Alexander
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people even if it was against Congress George the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America Listen to me the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne George you must declare yourself with us or against us
George remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold
This is a declaration of insurrection Who wrote this
What is this
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect
Do n't lie to me Hamilton If I had not court-martialed Arnold
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked You realize what would happen if this fort fell The whole Hudson would be open to them
Colonel Hamilton Anyone who served under Arnold I want them shipped north I do n't want any troops here who served under Arnold
Get the body of our army up to Greene 's vanguard as fast as we can All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us
They go back home to keep their families alive stay into the spring to plant Then they start coming back to us
We better Congress invented him
To learn to shoot cannon
It 's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for
But it 's what he said just before they killed him I regret that I have but one life to give to my country
With pleasure and an honor Did you hear about Nathan Hale
And is that the most horrible thing in the world
Well sir then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear
Therefore retreat
Excuse me General but may I ask how do you feel
I 'll expect you for dinner this evening Captain Hamilton For Christ 's sake have a bath
How old are you Captain
We 've got powder but no ball
Captain Alexander Hamilton sir
Who the hell knows Everyone 's giving orders It 's all very democratic
The last I heard a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed 's hill With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it
Horatio Horatio Gates of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation
ADAMS They are friends of Congress
ADAMS George I 'm sorry We all know the army will acquit Arnold
ADAMS Lafayette is a child
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief
I do n't know delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things And if he 's popular with his men
As does your ability Horatio We must talk further when it 's more convenient
ADAMS Yes an astonishing power over weak minds
ADAMS It 's the political 'cost of doing business George
ADAMS Again just to touch on a touchy subject but would the people accept another leader over Washington
ADAMS No one wants another failure right now God knows But people like Arnold and God knows I 'm having my fears about General Washington
ADAMS You think that
ADAMS Oh come now
ADAMS Makes you gag
ADAMS Let 's not over do it
ADAMS He 's from Virginia there is no more classist elitist English place on earth than Virginia And what in hell has he done for our cause Washington has been preaching compromise compromise compromise Hancock acts he led the Boston Tea party That 's why New England loves him
GREENE What 's the difference
GREENE We already have black soldiers in our army
GREENE The British Army is right back there across that river Sir I think it must be something else that detains General Lee
GREENE Detained by what
GREENE I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York why wo n't he come on
GREENE These men have suffered but I believe they will fight
REED If he is n't then he 's stupid
Are you all going insane Benedict Arnold The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain Who carried the day at Saratoga Goddamn-it Joseph you own two mansions ride in an expensive Tory coach You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs
Arnold is indispensable do you understand I need Arnold to help me win this war
REED The man is a traitor
Joseph are you afraid to cross that river with me I accept your resignation With regret You have leave to return to Philadelphia
They help me understand why we fight
How many generals do we have like Arnold He 's got guts he 's vain and he fights
They are also very religious So we will attack them three days from now on Christmas One force under me and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader
REED No I did not Really Well what the hell is a deist precisely
REED What do you mean you 're not a Christian Of course you 're a Christian we 're all Christians
No As a matter of fact I have n't the slightest idea what you 're talking about
A grand scheme
Joseph the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges In my opinion he saved my army
REED George So good to be back
REED I understand George
REED What can he do The British have massive superiority
A fleet
Any word from Canada
I feel the same sir
General Lee sir
My baby daughter has died my baby mon petite Henriette
When the snow melts mon petite Marquis I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers
Yes I will write him and tell his ministers and the court
Chose another Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses
Well we will accept these charming little gifts When we see them Meanwhile please take your pick of a horse
And how rusty are these muskets
These supplies
'Charming little victories Please do n't expect much more of us Monsieur
You must be very rich
No please an advance on your salary
I they look both the same
Uh none just now but
What I want to know is sir where is your daddy
But general I assure you my motives are sincere
However through my relations with members of his majesty 's court I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England Vive la France Vive l'Amerique
I want you to see our hospital
Come out and meet my soldiers They 're good people
Martha For God 's sake
Our 'kind What is that supposed to mean These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight They desire it They seek it Of course Virginia is terrified For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class from the face of the earth Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free If we win this war they will own this country too
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men It 's damned condescending
What 's the point of a revolution if it does n't
To win this war I need an army
Martha what
What else From Virginia
I think I heard that
And have you heard anything from our dear friend Sally What with all the rumors getting back to England I thought she might inquire after us But then I believe she always looked down on us
That 's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you
When you lived with the Fairfaxes
You 're no fool George You never have been
Everything If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands and that would be a boon for our family We already have more slaves than we need but we need more land
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I 'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he 's crazy Believe me this 'disturbance is n't going to last long You have to understand congress is a chicken coop full of foxes Martha each and every one has his eye on a nice fat prize
Do n't be ridiculous of course that wo n't happen
I 'm very aware of that
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised my dear a classless world Not a very real expectation
Of course if it were that simple These people They 're after something else
Our beloved father the King also refuses to bend
Surely you knew this was coming
It 's another demonstration against the king This is the wildest yet
GREENE If the constitution is ratified we 'll have a country They 'll want to elect you president of the convention which means president of the country
Well this must be about something
They 're for my bodyguard I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me do n't you think
GREENE I 'm honored but reluctant to leave you
You 've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in It 's all right boys I 'm here
GREENE Then maybe I do see what you 're after perhaps you get to chose again
GREENE But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner Sir
GREENE No We 're all of us after something It 's easy for me to fight for the common man My father could only dream that I would be a general someday And what of my daughter or son I know what I 'm after But now with all this talk about compromise It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope
GREENE Sir if you do n't mind my saying I do n't understand your history at all I mean why would you want to win the war You 're not after glory like Benedict You 're a slave owner and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army
GREENE They 're just disgusting jealous bottom-feeding swine It 's their nature
GREENE I 'm with Captain Hamilton
GREENE You wrong me general I am an officer and a horse-shoer
GREENE Well sir I was an ironmaster before you got me Maybe I will let you down yet
GREENE Sir Congress has n't issued their pay for two months many have not eaten properly for at least that long You 're being a little hard on them do n't you think
GREENE Yes but I 've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history And I read the lives of Caesar Alexander Hannibal Sir I 'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army
GREENE I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now My father is an ironmaster As was I
GREENE I was born with a limp sir The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway
GREENE I I 'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army sir
GREENE Colonel Washington Colonel Nathanael Greene Rhode Island Militia
They 're finished they ca n't help us anymore They 've done their duty General Greene now you do yours
We ca n't take them Are you all right
Really Which precious homily was it
I remember a pair of young philosophers once who laughed at the world
I 'd throw everything away for you
Perhaps you 've been counting my acres Mrs Fairfax and discovered exactly how poor I really am
That 's a lie
But not more than your comfort
Is that the truth Well we ca n't carry on like animals any longer
Well the widow Curtis will bring you riches position land even half-grown children You wo n't have to do anything at all You sha n't have to do another thing to prove yourself
Think what the play means William Perhaps these words have a place in the real world
Except for that quite like home England that is
That 's not what I said Now Sally you 're embarrassing me Watch out for her George she talks refinement but she has a barbarous soul
George I 'm sorry
Voltaire of course
Remember George It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong
WASHINGTON I 'm lost in ecstasy And dost thou love Thou charming maid

WASHINGTON Sally our slave system is a British law
WASHINGTON Slavers capture them and bring them here
WASHINGTON Africa of course
God damn you Sam Adams You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we 've really got one it scares you more than it does the British
ADAMS Well I hear 'The People Indentured servants freed slaves escaped slaves The world 's castaways And my fear is in the scramble for power that 's coming you will betray them
ADAMS You hear that
ADAMS And 'others say have you even read Locke Vattel Voltaire Diderot
ADAMS I say
ADAMS Yes
ADAMS All people have rights
ADAMS You are a slave owner You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley That land belongs to the natives
WASHINGTON William we 've been studying hard I really know my stuff

What three hundred grand
Depends Who 's this
Who is this
Whatever you want Ray
I like it here
Sovereign
I checked the bag at the airport when I came
Why would I do that
So what brings you to L.A Bones
How 'd you get in here
You a quick draw 'bro You better be your piece stuck way down in your belt like that
Tough shit bro This ai n't Miami You want something talk to me
Get in line bro
The man you 're steppin on belongs to me and my partner
Ray Barboni From Miami
Get him out 've here
That 's the idea I 'll think about it
Something should n't be there
By the way you recall the number of the locker you used
Your wife a Lakers fan
You have a card in here
You 're an investor is that it
What 're you doing in Los Angeles
You live in Miami
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand sixty days over a movie producer
Hey Chil Since you 're goin out to L.A anyway
Leo spanked a waitress
Do n't waste your time Harry The guy 's not much of a movie fan Now c'mon gim me the key
Tell you what Harry tomorrow morning when the airport 's crowded I 'll go check it out If I do n't see a problem I 'll pick up the money
Ray Barboni Guy from Miami owns Leo now that Momo died
Harry if I gave you Leo 's money you 'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you 'd be in a whole new kinda trouble
Forget about Leo 's money Harry
So how 'bout it Mr Selznick do I make my deal with Bo Or you gon na finally help me out have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him
Yeah he wants us to talk to Buddy set up a meeting
I mean at least Bo 's invested in three of my movies
Cash It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport
Get the fuck outta my chair
Yeah Chili Hi You 're fifty feet in the air
How 's anyone gon na see anything from way up there
That 's the difference between you and me Harry I say what I mean I want something from someone I ask 'em straight out I want Martin Weir I go get Martin Weir I do n't fuck around with his trainer 's shrink
You tell me you want these guys off your back Next thing I know you 're saying yeah maybe they can have a piece of Mr Lovejoy I could n't believe my fuckin ears
I had to tell 'em something
What
You do n't say any more n you have to You say 'Well I 'm glad you assholes stopped by so I can set you straight
They 'll be looking at you They do n't know who you are
Read it It 's a grabber
Let 's see how we get along
Harry I probably know 'em better than you do
But I could talk to the limo guys Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while Make the point in a way they 'd understand it
I 'm not gon na pop her Harry
So you 're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie
Heart attack Apparently they brought a couple hookers along
The problem is Murray He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago Murray never made it back
Anyway Murray has this shrink who also happens to be Martin 's personal trainer 's shrink Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin 's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out and Martin flips Loves it
She looks familiar
No his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt Whitney
Martin Weir He played the mob guy that turned snitch in The Cyclone
Who 's the star
It 's not bad when you know what it 's about
Mr Lovejoy
A blockbuster But quality No mutants or maniacs This one 's gon na be my Driving Miss Daisy
Because I need half a million to buy a script
Because they 're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint The first thing they 'd do is break my legs
Harry look at me
Racketeering that covers a lot of ground does n't it
Really You ever been arrested
Ever shot anybody
What does that mean
You pack a gun
I imagine in your line of work there were times you had to get rough you know say one of your customers stopped paying
Is that right that 's what you do for a living
I 'm out here looking for Leo I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend Dick Allen
I 'm not the guy Harry
You mean Leo
Part of it yeah
The shylock 's the good guy
I said I had an idea that 's all
I do n't know about his wanting to meet celebrities that 's something new But yeah he comes to L.A Then after that I do n't know what happens
Well since Leo 's name was on the passenger list
That 's right As a matter of fact
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken You have to understand the loan shark 's in business the same as anybody else He is n't in it to hurt people He 's in it to make money
I mean the way you told it to me Start at the beginning we see how the story line develops
You want to hear this idea It 's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand Go on tell her
Karen say hello to Chili Palmer Chili this is Karen Flores
You make movies huh
Come on Harry  Mesas The worst they might do is get a judgment against you uttering a bad check I ca n't imagine you want that to happen man in your position
I want you to
You 're not looking at me Harry
I know what a marker is
Harry lem me give you some advice
We 're there Harry You signed markers for a hundred and a half you 're over sixty days past due and you have n't told anybody what the problem is
You know Dick Allen Mesa 's Casino
I want you to keep looking right here okay
You look okay to me Harry Come over here and sit down Tell me what you been up to
We just did I told you my name 's Chili Palmer
Where you been Harry
BONES Exactly You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket I do n't give a fuck You do n't ever hand me a book with a miss in it
BONES You owe me the dry cleaner 's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another uhh
BONES Bullshit E.g is short for 'ergo
BONES Which also means when I speak I 'm speakin for Jimmy So e.g as of now you start affording me the proper respect
BONES Yeah well maybe the guy took out flight insurance Check with the wife
BONES What Get Away jet
BONES Personally
BONES How 'd you know he died he tell you
BONES You got a miss Leo Devoe Guy 's six weeks over
BONES You cut straight hair in this place or just fags
Whatta you think Chill
Compass
Yeah I like it I 'm high up I can see everything you know It 's the Cadillac of minivans
Buddy
You 're not going to tell me the rest
Okay I 'm listening
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look
The wife sues the airline This is a gutsy babe
Yeah but you have n't found him yet The guy took off for Las Vegas
I believe it
That 's not bad
Now you 're squinting like you need glasses
What you 're telling me you 're tired You wan na go to bed
No I want you to look at me the way I 'm looking at you Put it in your eyes 'You 're mine asshole without saying it
Martin look at me
Pressure I 'm the one applied the pressure
Martin I 'm not connected to those people anymore Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami
One we 're producing
I 'm thinking of a movie
So you want to know
So you do n't know what I 'm thinking
You mean like we do n't give a shit
We talk different
Well you had it down cold Watching you in the movie if I did n't know better I 'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting Even the fink part I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do but how you did it must be the way finks act
You know Marty you were good in The Cyclone
I 'll find you Leo
At eighteen percent okay And do n't ask me no more fuckin questions I 'm leaving
Sit down Leo
You can keep what you won today That 's yours
I would n't let her if she tried Why I 'm here Leo basically is to save your ass
Here 's another tip
Now you 're down to three-ten in the case You must 've cooled off quite a bit since you got here
From when You left Vegas with four fifty
You 've been losing
They report it to the IRS
I did n't know where else to keep it Where would you
I know who he works for Where 's your phone
Lem me get this straight You are n't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine but you 're gon na find Ray Bones coat or get him a new one Is that what you 're telling me
Maybe you do n't see my sign
It 's not one of these
What took you so long
I 'll be right back
You do n't act like it
Were you scared up there
Karen What the fuck are you doing
You okay
You 're as bad as Harry
Are you going down
He 's doing the same thing you did to him playing Letterman on TV
Yeah Harry you look like you belong in one of your horror movies
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu They have to think of something they have to have that is n't on the menu
Continental but it does n't matter Martin wo n't order from the menu
What happened
Hey Chili Look at me
Whichever Let 's talk about it tomorrow
Oh
You thought I was faking
Really
Yeah
How 'bout Chili 's Hollywood Adventure
So what about your story You thought of a title yet
Oh I like him I just think he 's short I mean he 's a good actor and all but I 'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty
I do n't know I 'm just havin some trouble seeing you two together
How 'd you meet Martin anyway
Depends who pays
The guy 's setting you up You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he 's paying you back
Yeah We understand you read the script and like it a lot
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant
Yeah well I like movies I figure if I help Harry make one I 'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money That does n't sound too hard I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time
I was never much into it All that bullshit having to do with respect It 's bad enough having to treat those guys like they 're your heroes having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think 's real funny
Why does anyone want to be in movies
That why you came over here to ask me that
Sounds fair
There a part in it for you
Not yet
I do n't like the title Or the main guy 's name
What do you think
I got you a copy of the script
You been here the whole time
Right See how your story ends
Do n't go out of your way
Yeah well Martin is known for his flipping He flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out
Harry 's dreaming of a forty-million dollar production he 'll never get off the ground with a star he 'll never sign With or without my help
He must mean after Slime Creature 3
I married Martin That was a full time job
Yeah you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch gives him a flirty look and says I 'd kiss you but
Yeah It 's a real gift I 'm just saying it 'd be nice one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line You know like in that Bette Davis picture Cabin in the
I know I 'm better than what I 've been doing the last ten years walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps waiting till it 's time to scream
Yeah that was a good scene I mean for a horror movie
You saw that one
That 's what we finally decided
I spent all day crawling out of a grave The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons 
Yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out
Lem me get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before
What 're you doing here
How much is the wife offered
A real bargain
But a week That 's a hundred and fifty percent a year
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand
Well basically this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand plus he 's a few weeks behind on the vig the interest you have to pay
No it was open It was n't locked
The door from the patio in back
I do n't think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer
I 'm thinking about producing
I 'm going into the movie business
Yeah well I 'm in L.A now
How 'd he know I was in Vegas You tell him
You gon na start that again You 're just like him all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin thing
You said do n't say nothing and I did n't
Do n't say a fuckin word
In an armchair Or I go to a coffee shop sleep there Sit in a booth pull my hat down
No I said I 'm never goin to bed There 's a difference See the article says most people die in their beds I figure long as I stay outta bed I 'm safe
Hey Chili Get your coat but do n't piss the guy off okay It could get complicated and we 'd have to call Momo to straighten it out Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we do n't need that
That 's what the guy said
What 's Momo gon na want with an old place shows old movies people do n't care about no more Outside of maybe turnin it into a porno house I do n't think he 's gon na give much of a fuck And you already got a job
What I 'm thinkin is maybe Momo could buy it
They 're closing the Granview You know theater down on Biscayne
That 's great Harry So what 's the
You heard me Pick n Save
Pick n Save
She 's scared Fear is an emotion Look kid if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm let it be the three key words to filmmaking
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gon na distance us from the emotion of the scene
Whatta you mean whose point of view The audience 's point of view
How honorable of you
Yeah what 'd he have to say
So this means you 've reconsidered our deal on Mr Lovejoy
I mean morally Murray was my friend
I 'm not sure how I feel about this Doris
Yeah me too He was a helluva good writer And I would know I discovered him Made him what he was
Yeah lovely Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there What do you want Doris
Come on in
Harry Zimm You look like a wet kiss
Man 's in town two days thinks he 's David O fucking Selznick
Chili and me
Harry we spoke with Martin
Harry what 're you still doing with those guys
What I 'm saying Harry is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house
Well I got an audition tomorrow
With your experience you could always become an agent Right Harry
That Miami flight that went down it was on the news every day for about a week Harry must 've been busy
He 's telling me an idea for a movie It 's not bad so far Sit down have a drink Tell Karen let 's see what she thinks
I 'm going
Anyone skim the pool It needs it
You do n't What happened to Muff
Yeah well I turned off the set I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor You know what could 've happened The dog came in and stepped on it turned the TV back on
I do n't hear anything
What 's wrong
The three hundred large What other money is there I should keep quiet I know till I 've read the script but I 've got a feeling about this one I 'm that shylock
I have to run But what I hope to see they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it but in the end they ca n't Can they
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them it not only heightens the tension it adds a wistful element to their love
And after all you have such morals
Thanks
I 'm intrigued yeah You know what might help you take a look at the Cylone again the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels Hey  This your ride Chili
Yeah Karen knows him
I know I 'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock Okay what 's my motivation The acquisition of money To collect Inflict pain if I have to
'It did n't slip away Martin you did when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party
Really

A passenger liner north island Over
A passenger liner Over
North Island I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention
After fifty years there ai n't nothin left but shoe leather
Lem me see was that before or after the oil fire
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
Wrong It 's Friday
What day is it
I ai n't no mechanic just so you know
Yeah Hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later We call this in now gon na be Coastguard FBI who knows who all over the place
She 's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we 'd never know it
We 'll see who 's dreamin m'man
It 's a beautiful country Very clean Very civilized And cold
Looks like it took out the backup genny too
Morning skipper
Take it easy Dodge It 's only a piece of metal
Yeah a ship that 's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago You do n't think that 's just a little freaky
Lem me see
What You sure
How about now
You think the extra strain caused it
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
With that coxswain dickhead
I 'll sleep good tonight knowing that
Yeah yeah
What
Why not
Hell no You think I 'm crazy
Right Wednesday
Then what the hell happened to him
I heard a scream When I got there I found him on the floor He was having some kind of seizure I did n't see anybody else
A what
Oh yeah
Seen a lota movies
Maybe he is n't alone
I 'm saying we got ta do whatever we got ta do to preserve our interest
Fifty million dollars Fifty million We gon na let this guy just take it from us One guy
Maybe that is his boat
Light in those passages ai n't so good
What 're you crazy
I tell you one thing we 're not gon na be towing no ship now
Thanks for the warning Ow Damn
Or uninvited guests
Yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong That 's a damn big boat It 's either sunk or it ai n't
Ever heard of insurance big boy
Bring it on dude
Then we 'll all be doomed Any other questions
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it ai n't gon na be what you 'd call easy Any questions
Out here What so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now
No
Yeah
Roger
Maureen
Maureen
What
Why not
Amidships starboard at the beam Just under the waterline I do n't think it 's a problem
Right
Sorry
There 's a charming thought
Right
Then you 're a lucky man
If money can buy what he wants
Turbine chamber on number two must 've blown Took out part of the hull
You better get down here right now We 're taking water Big time
Look I did n't touch it Alright
I did n't touch the fucking radio Ever occur to you there 's somebody else on that boat skipper
You did n't want us calling anybody Too liable to ruin your big payday
Do n't lie to me
You smashed it
The radio Oh yeah the radio
Maybe you can tell me then
I do n't know what you 're talking about
With all due respect skipper Part of that up there 's mine I 'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it
For starters getting that gold off the ship What they do n't know about is n't gon na bother them
Yeah well The truth is one thing When there 's more than a few hundred million dollars involved that 's a whole new deal
Well they 're gon na be asking a lot of questions About us About those bodies About the gold Seems like we oughta be prepared is all
So I got a question Just from a you know purely technical standpoint We call the Coastguard Coastguard shows up What exactly is the plan
On a passenger ship in 1953
It was a man 's voice Repeating some sort of children 's rhyme I do n't know it did n't make any sense You did n't hear it
What is it
Murphy
Right
I might be able to find something on the ship But it 's gon na take time
So whoever did this might still be around
Could be meant as a warning
Fresh ai n't the first word that comes to mind
Yeah reconsider fucking his shit up
We 'll stand a watch Four on eight off Low man first
Why not Why the fuck not
I say fuck the motherfucker We 're a professional salvage crew going about our business What 's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway
Bullshit That boat has n't made steam for fifty years We found her She 's ours
Warm water current maybe making the metal expand
Yeah yeah
How about you Epps
The sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending what 's ours
So we get a little more for the boat Besides the gold 'll be safer where it is
It looks like it
A salvage claim to a vessel 's cargo 's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself It 's ours
Either way they must 've had a pretty good reason
Then it happened before they scuttled her
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it
It 's a hell of a lot of money
Went aboard
Obviously it 's some kind of screw up The shipping records are n't a hundred percent accurate
Goddamit Dodge
How long
How long then
What about running number two by itself
We got ta get outa here Dodge A storm blows up and we 're history
But how long
I know I know two ways to do anything
How much longer 's that gon na take
I thought you said it was just a blade
What 's this
How long to fix
Threw a turbine blade
Mother fucker
With a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make Sitka in five days without another stop
It 's a bloody navigation hazard One boat ca n't control a ship that size
If you get it back in one piece
Yeah from one side of the harbor to the other But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here It 's way out of the lanes There 's not a port for 800 miles
You are n't jealous are you Dodge
I ca n't believe you Dodge 's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share
What
You okay
I do n't even want to know what that 's gon na taste like now
Sudden flashes of light
Headache nausea lights
Any dizziness
Stay away Or else
Coffee
What 'd he look like
That 's a good thing
That 's what I call a payday
Probably did n't have time
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice
He 'd let you off at the nearest port that 's for sure
Too big More like a freighter
I bet you did
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you Epps
Maybe twenty gallons an hour
I wish I could believe that Either way you know what I 've done I 've got no choice
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo There 's nothing supernatural about greed And that 's what it comes down to pure and simple
I know a little bit about human nature and what I 've seen only confirms that
I think I see it pretty well
I did n't want it to turn out this way
The way I figure it it was them or me I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch Bought a little time Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around But it 's just us on this ship Us and your spirit friends
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody You saw it coming as well as I did Dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat And Greer too except he went nuts Could n't take it I guess Could 've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage But did it make him any less dangerous I do n't think so
Greer 's gone He broke out of the tank
What
What happened
If the weather holds it might not be so bad
Crazy with greed Not crazy Not like him
Maybe it was more than that
Could be a stroke Who knows The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves Like wild dogs
Leave him till we can get some help From now on nobody comes down here
Right here
He 's not on deck and I ca n't raise him on the radio
Either of you seen Dodge
Murphy to Epps
Why you How come the rest of us have n't seen these people
What 's that supposed to mean
More than just a mutiny More than just the gold
Something bad happened here Murphy
No I think they are were just passengers Innocent victims
What happened
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word It was more than that As though they were showing me
What like some kind of ghost
Not our mystery guest again
I do n't know are we
Never mind Before your time I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune Equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide What happened after that is anybody 's guess But judging by our Greek friends down below it does n't look like the last time
I guess that 's the sixty four thousand dollar question is n't it
Wish I could say the same
Hey
Does n't matter
Let 'em ask This ship 's legally ours now
If it was a ship she hit
But where 's the damage
Collision With what
Must not 've been the captain 's entry He was probably out of the picture by then
February first
But who
Somebody took it out of commission last night
The ah the radio 's out
If they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
Possibly false Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea I do n't think mutiny 's out of the question here
No I 'll try again later
How 's he doing
He needs a doctor
Greer
Yeah Just a bird Just a stupid bird
Epps
Yup
No cowboy shit Right
Dodge get on that turbine I do n't care if you do n't sleep for a week The sooner you 're done the sooner we can get out of here How 's the food situation
We do n't exactly have the best bargaining position
It was n't you It was somebody else There 's somebody else aboard
Of course I 'm sure I saw him
I saw him Just a minute ago Some guy
There 's somebody else on this boat
The guy He just came this way
Did you see him
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
Maybe But there 's always somebody whose interest 's at stake
Only way to be
I think we 'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current
Nobody knows There 've been a lot of theories of course But we 'll never really know for sure
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872 One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel the Dei Gratia As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste On boarding they found her completely deserted The captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble The table was even set for dinner And in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste
Her destination was Halifax yeah
Some charts A crew manifest Looks like her last voyage was January 1953 The question is where the hell 's she been since
Yeah Thanks
They must 've scuttled it Nobody just lets a ship float away
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks At least Who knows could be more Could be a lot more What I 'm proposing is we split it four ways
It 's my pen name
Fine with me
All I 'm saying is that gold 's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was
Now hold up just a minute Let 's be reasonable here
What about the gold
So whoever did this now has our shotgun
Must 've heard something below deck and went down to check it out
The mooring has n't come taught
Government weather It 's got a transmitter aboard
It 's a Noaa buoy
Shut up
The coast guard has our last position They 'll send somebody out soon enough A ship this size you ca n't exactly miss
Alright Everybody grab your gear This is where we get off
I wish I could tell you I 'd be real interested to know myself
Oh man
Say what
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera Down somewhere in there scavenging around
What happened
How 're you feeling
Never been more thirsty in my life
Maybe Epps 's mystery man had something to do with it
Greek citizen Merchant navy Obviously we are n't the first to come across this ship They probably stumbled across it just like we did
Ho-ly shit
Pretty low all around
I say we off-load some of that gold now
Let 's just take it easy here alright Nobody 's gon na kill anybody
Moving to Sweden
Not much at all I guess Retire Live out my golden years and all that
And get a bunch of fools sniffin around here
What now
I heard that
Yeah but we still got ta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka
So what We gon na unload the gold and get a move on
If they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off
Hard to say Maybe forty fifty million
Guess I must 've fallen back to sleep Where 's Epps
Morning
Some classy tub in it 's day huh
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it
You mean tow her back That 's a thirty thousand ton ship you 're talking about
Sorry
Besides a little rust everything 's pretty well-preserved
It 's funny
Call the Coastguard
Too deep to anchor out there
I been watching it for close to an hour and it has n't moved I ca n't raise it on the radio either Makes me think it might be in trouble
Yeah
Red sky at night sailor 's delight
You got that right
He 'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid
What do you say Dodge
Of course they did
Go
Or what
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you 're interrupting it
Did n't you hear me grandpa Or you got your hearing aid turned down
Why n't you mind your own business chief
You want fair pay make hamburger for Mickey D Otherwise please to sign
Twenty You knock off twenty and then we see After my guy looks at it
That cost me twenty grand at least
No no You got leak
What 's this
I thought you say Tuesday
But I ca n't
I just buzzed him in
Actually I was just checking to see if you were here your friend Seymour is on his way up
She understands what you 're going through and she really wants to help you She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it
Yeah I heard about that
Are you going to yell at me
Well as you know Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want
I 've got some important news to tell you but it can wait till later if you 're not feeling
Nothing
Tell her to forget it I do n't need her help
I guess
What is it now
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow
Hi Look I 'm kind of tired I think I 'll go to bed
Yup
Maxine
Give up
Someone from the past
Guess
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place
Well I think it 's good to keep all your options open You can always enroll for the winter quarter You could even live here and go to the city college part time and still get a job if you wanted to
It 's tough to find a good job without any kind of training
Not if I do n't find that goddamn spatula
Have you seen my blue spatula
Enid and I were just friends You know we feel comfortable around each other she really likes my old records and
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen
What are you trying to say
Hey so what brings you down here
Oh please do n't let me interrupt finish your phone call
Hello
Seymour uh hello I guess I 'm a little early
Uh no I missed that one But what do I know I like Laurel and Hardy movies
Oh all right Party-pooper Just let me put a few things away
No really I
Uh well that 's okay I do n't dance heh heh
Was it Bosnia I forget It 's so sad the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention She goes over and turns it up
Here we are it 's mocha mint from Lickety Splits Oh is n't that photograph just heart-rending
That was great jeez thanks again for cooking all this
But can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy
Help me what
I did n't check my messages
Huh
What do you mean
Let me know as soon as you can Enid This could be a great thing for you
Well yes
So what do you think
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything it is really quite an offer
Well I know this is really short notice but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art Design and she tells me that I 'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program and well I hope you do n't mind Enid but I took the liberty of submitting your name
Do n't worry it 's nothing bad I was just wondering what your plans were for next year
Enid can I talk to you for a minute
And how does an image like this help us to see that
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism
Did you actually do this painting
These are all valid comments but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this
I dunno I just like Don Knotts
It 's supposed to be Don Knotts
Enid It 's sort of like a diary I guess
Jesus
But I feel weird it 's so sleazy
What I 'm just kidding around with the customers It 's my shtick
Okay okay I wo n't say a word
But I was only trying to be friendly
Why What difference does it make You already got his money
You can count on me sir
Are you ready to go
Hi Enid
Okay I promise
Why not
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere
How long have you been up
Oh hi
You must have known all along how I you know how I felt about you it must be totally obvious God I always used to dream about this
Yeah well
You make me nervous I always feel like you 're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me
When did I say I hated you
Nothing
Yeah right
What do you mean why
Do you want something to drink
Are you the one who left that note
Hi what 's up

I need to talk to you
FUCK YOU Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life
You 're the psycho You have n't been able to deal with anything since high school ended
There 's something wrong with every single place we look at Why do n't you just come right out and tell me you do n't want to move in with me

I am not I just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do
No really
I think one of us should fuck Josh
Well are we still going shopping tomorrow
Do you want to do something tonight
If it makes you feel any better I do n't think you could 've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff
Now are you going to get a regular job
What was that all about I thought everything must go
Fuck it Everything must go
I told you my manager was a total asshole Do n't worry I 'm going to get another job and anyway I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime
We were such desperate sluts back then
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine
Was n't it like eighth grade
I dunno but next week is my last class
Yeah maybe it 'll be okay At least I 'll get to see every movie for free I guess I had to lie and tell them I already graduated
Get away from me
Have n't you heard about the miracle of masturbation
Face it you hate every single boy on the face of the earth
You 're just jealous
He gives me a total boner
You 're gross See that guy
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you

Let 's go hassle Josh
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back
We still have to go in there sometime
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade
Okay okay I promise Jesus you 're out of your mind
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you
What are you talking about
What is she black now
Somewhere downtown
Forget it I ca n't explain it
Yeah but you know what I mean
I dunno I kind of like him He 's the exact opposite of everything I really hate In a way he 's such a clueless dork that he 's almost cool
Oh yeah
It was so cute how he had his own little bags I thought I was going to start crying Do you think they 're gay
I know I still ca n't get over that his name was Seymour
Ew it 's like some gross rat
Gross
Come on it 's too late now
Bingo
I 'm afraid if I see him I 'll start feeling really bad again
This is way too creepy
I know would n't you be totally pissed off
We should follow him home
Totally Look
I dunno
He 's still just sitting there God this is totally unbearable
Oh my god he just ordered a giant glass of milk
I ca n't believe it
What exactly is a cardigan anyway
She says she wants to MMPH

It 's still twenty-five minutes early
Yeah Josh c'mon MOVE IT
God I think Josh is too mature for us
What does it stand for
You 're better at it
You call
You know the green cardigan guy
Hey We forgot to call the loser
That Larry guy what look was he going for A gay tennis player from the forties

No she was the second wife The third one was the super-bitch Maxine There Look at her
There 's my dad with Joanie
Look that 's back when I hated you
Look at how cute I am
You lent it to me in like tenth grade
I dunno John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff There 's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace
Wait I just want to see what 's on this tape
Is n't it weird It 's her favorite
Oh we totally have to
I know And he 's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail
Jesus Listen to this one Do you remember me Airport shuttle June 7th You striking redhead with yellow dress pearl necklace brown shoes I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens Am I crazy or did we have a moment
Okay well here 's yours Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken Not this one Stunning bod very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer

Did you notice all those weird things on the menu Like The Salad Explosion
I might actually get the pasta special
Hi Al
Who can forget this great hit from the 50 's
Authentic 50 's diner Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950 's
Okay okay
Or maybe not
That lets us off the hook
What do you do if you 're a satanist anyway
Much later
Hey look the satanists are leaving
God it 's so weird that we 're finally out of high school We 've been waiting for this our whole life Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want It 's such a weird feeling
Did you sign up yet
So when are we going to start looking for our apartment
Why
Hi
Good
He better watch out or he 'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her
Oh my god look Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh
Since when is she an actress
What Why
Shut up
Just think we 'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again
This is so bad it 's almost good
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year I did n't think that just because you get an F that means you have to take the class over again
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class
What Oh suck my fucking dick
I know I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she 's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her
God what a bunch of retards
Well I 'm going to major in Business Administration and I think minor in Communications
Just because
We 're not
What about me Am I not even here
Well we wo n't keep you
What are you doing here Melorra
Well bye you guys CONGRATULATIONS
I 'm going to be in this actor 's workshop and I 'm hoping to start going on auditions soon I 'm so excited to finally have some free time We have to get together this summer
So what are you guys doing this Summer
Oh my God you guys I ca n't believe we made it
Oh yeah like he even noticed
Shhh
I 'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards
Where did you get those pants
It 's kind of falling apart
I thought it was n't for sale
Him Seymour He 's the man with the records
Seymour does
That 's okay
Umm That 's not officially for sale I might have to hang onto that for the time being
A mongoose they eat snakes you never heard of a mongoose That 's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that
ELLIS Get a job
ELLIS I 'm so sorry if you were offended
ELLIS Oh how punk
That 's not even
I know it 's over asshole I
Tell me what
You do n't know what you 're talking about
Yes
Norman
Later Dude
Thanks for the tape I 'll have to pay you later I 'm broke
Tsk You Jews are so clever with money
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine
Fine and how are you
Well if it is n't Enid and Rebecca the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend
Why do you even want it It would look stupid on you
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity
Five hundred
That 's five hundred dollars
I really want to talk to you I 've been thinking about what you said about moving in here
But I
You must know I always did you really mean all that about moving in with me
I-I never expected anything like this to happen
I will if you want to
Do you really want us to drive away somewhere
What 's the matter with you Seymour Do n't you like me Be a man for once in your life
What do you want
I 'm serious I 'm just so sick of everybody Why ca n't I just do whatever I want
Who cares Let 's just go what 's stopping us
I 'll drive then we 'll go out in a blaze of glory
You know what we should do Let 's go get in your car right now and just take off We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life fuck everybody
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it and I 'd just disappear and they 'd never see me again
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place Do you ever think about stuff like that
You know what my number one fantasy used to be
Oh yeah and Dana You were a lot more fun before you met Dana You 've been acting way too normal lately you 're a bitter twisted fucked-up guy Seymour that 's why I like you
Maybe I should just move in here with you I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job
I dunno I always feel like everybody secretly hates me I 'm just paranoid I guess I mean you like me do n't you We 're good friends right
Yeah but still it 's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date you never asked me out
At least you 're not like every other stupid guy in the world all they care about are guitars and sports they 're all such fags
What are you talking about You 're disappointed every minute of your life
That 's great Half-empty that 's what I like about you Seymour you 're a natural pessimist
Jesus how can you stand her
Where did you get this
You need a bigger place this is like a little kid 's room
That 's Dana 's I 'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary You better not
Uh I think there 's some root beer
What 's the matter
Uh sure come in
What 's up
What are you doing here
What do you mean
I do n't know I 'm sorry but Dana 's a very jealous person I just do n't want to screw that up right now I 'm sure she 'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends
In what way do you mean
No of course not
I I do n't think so
Just someone so young
No no not exactly she just does n't understand how I would know somebody like you
No of course I do It 's just that right now I need to
Well you know what do I know about clothes I 've never been the most fashionable guy it 's nice to have someone do all the work for me
Oh uh they were a present from Dana
Well when can we do something
Well forget the art show let 's do something else
Of course you should C'mon I 'm already a million hours late
I 'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date There 's something I have to show you
so is he your boyfriend now
I-I 'm sorry uh so uh how
No no it 's just that I should get going in a few minutes and
We really should get together sometime soon I-I 'll definitely call you this week
Sort of she does n't dislike any of that stuff she 's trying anyway actually we 're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon
Oh pretty well surprisingly you know
I know I 'm sorry I-I 've been really busy
Really
YAAA
Jesus Enid I 'll talk to you later bye
Yeah so I better go it 's not really the best time to talk
Actually it 's kind of still happening she 's over here right now I think everything 's going pretty well
Oh hi
Uh hello
How can you be so sure
Uh yeah A long time ago she called before once it 's just somebody trying to humiliate me
It 's just somebody 's idea of a joke
Let the machine get it I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me
Who knows
I wo n't even dignify that with a response
Why
Oh yeah
Then again that 's easy for me to say since I 'll never even get a date I 'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you
I 'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really would n't change anything
Really
That 's the spirit
Maybe now you understand why I ca n't get a date
Oh uh It 's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support
It 's just my stupid back I 'll be all right in a minute
Arrrghhh Ah Jeez Christ
Oh uh thanks a lot Enid I really appreciate it
Do n't you trust me Seymour
I promise I 'll take good care of it
Hey can I borrow this
So I do n't really get it are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this
Yeah but still
Jesus I 'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day
What are you a fry cook or something
You work at Cook 's Chicken
Yeah well Cook 's is just a made up name When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named The Coon Chicken Inn that 's an early painting of their first logo
Yeah right I 'm a klansman thanks a lot Do you know the Cook 's Chicken franchise
What Oh that I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago I guess it 's mine now
I dunno because I ca n't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you ca n't get a date
Wow this is so cool
It does n't matter I 'm not staying long I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet
Hooray for me
But it 's not totally hopeless for you I 've had it I do n't even have the energy to try anymore You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you do n't end up like me
Yeah well it 's simple for everybody else give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they 're happy I just ca n't relate to 99.9 of humanity
Look I really appreciate your help Enid but let 's face it this is hopeless
Now I remember why I have n't gone anywhere in months I 'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there I might as well be from another planet
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label
Just wait here
Well offer her a seat You want me to do it
Jesus Seymour
I 'm not holding my breath in that department
I brought it for him to autograph He 's going to be amazed to see it it 's one of two known copies I ca n't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner What an insult
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud it 's like someone jabbing me in the face KFTO comin atchya on this beautiful evening
C'mon Seymour please
These are older women just dressed up to look young I think
OH MY GOD
Wow Look at all these creeps
I really do n't think it 's a good idea
I do n't think so
I I 'd really rather not
Yeah sure very funny
Well are
So is that your boyfriend
Well let 's see I guess I 'd have to put Traditional Jazz Blues and Ragtime music at the top of the list then probably
Maybe I do n't want to meet someone who shares my interests I hate my interests Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself
I mean as long as she 's not a complete imbecile and she 's even remotely attractive
I 'm just not one of those guys who has a type
Jesus
I really did n't get a good look at her
I do n't know what kind of question is that I mean it 's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me
Jesus That 's very nice of you Enid but I I really
I appreciate the offer but you really do n't
Yeah well
Good luck
Oh right
Yeah right If I 'm so cool why have n't I had a girlfriend in four years I ca n't even remember the last time a girl talked to me
You think it 's healthy to obsessively collect things You ca n't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff I 'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers
Please go ahead and kill me This stuff does n't make you happy believe me
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point I 've tried to pare down my collection to the essential
Yeah well sure you can if you want to it 's just I do n't want all these guys in there at once you know
Oh God no This is just junk I have for sale or trade The record room is off-limits
I I did n't think you would have any interest in this get together I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you it 's not like a real party or anything
Hey I was only kidding
Oops I dropped it
Yeah sure I guess
Wow
Yeah that 's good too the whole record was good but that one song Devil Got My Woman I mostly just keep playing that one over and over Do you have any other records like that
Yeah it took a while before I got a chance to play it but when I heard that song it was like
A dollar seventy-five
Wow
Nah it 's not so great Here 's the one I 'd recommend
Well there 's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff
There 's some good stuff in here do you like old music
Those are all 78s Can you play 78s
You know like weird 1960 's Indian rock n roll music
Do you have any old Indian records
Let me tell ya somethin Joe Listen to me Joe you ca n't hit a home run without swinging the bat
Seymour You got ta be kidding me
So what 's the story with the two cheerleaders over here
Yeah well thanks for cheering me up
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy Who knows It could be a million things It 's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain that 's for sure
Still torturing yourself over that Enid huh
Well here 's where the fun never stops
Yeah
I wish I could see him
He has every reason to freak out this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody
Forget it there 's no way find some other poor sucker to abuse
I think it 's really a wonderful piece Margaret
This shocking image of repressed femininity
Very good Now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent
I can see that now what can you tell us about it First of all what kind of sculpture is this
What do we have here Margaret
It 's my response to the issue of a woman 's right to choose it 's something I feel super-strongly about
I am
What fake blind date What are you talking about
What are you talking about
What do you mean
Did she say that
Why did you say she might be hiding from me Did she say anything to you about me
Really I do n't know enough about it to
I have no idea I just want to
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating I thought maybe she was
I do n't know
Maybe she 's with Josh
Why would she be hiding from me
Uh do you mind if I wait I really need to talk to her
No they said she was here
Uh hi Uh Enid 's stepmother told me I 'd find her here
Yes
Do n't thank me You 're doing all the work
Why do n't we start with that next week
Remember what I said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you
So tell me more about this job What exactly will you be doing
careful Abdullah
I was n't and you know it and do n't push it just listen we have a problem in Tsavo
that 's ridiculous talk and you ca n't seriously believe it
As are they all
You think so Fine It 's best you get out Go Tell all your people to go run home where they 'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here they were the only ones to flee
He sees this chaos he 'll replace you all
you do not call me a liar you know nothing of their health consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay
On that I choose to remain dubious Two are dead now in two nights
Oh you 're a doctor now too
malaria epidemic very sudden
We 'll have to make them come to us wo n't we And since there are two of them we 're going to set two plans in motion First we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night
Starting now we attack them
Excellent decision Your name is Abdullah I 'm sure we 'll meet again Go and enjoy the splendid morning
Am I to take it you want to live
You 're right The Devil has come Look at me I am the Devil
No hints Samuel
Understand I had help
Every man who 's ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him the lions will be dead
All they 'll bring is more chaos and we 've plenty of that already and if they come in word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people do n't you Well fine except there is n't a higher rated engineer and we both know that And since time is so important to you how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here
What
And it worked
Are you running a high fever man How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed How could you even conceive of it
In that half will be bait human bait I 'll start things off a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor
This is supposed to be salvation What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here
It has n't been that simple so far
It 's what the natives are calling the lions two lions have been causing trouble
Yes he is
Starling
But overall you 're pleased
So work must be going well
Lovely sound they seem happy
Pleasant journey
Very moving Patterson I 'm touched you confided in me But I do n't really give a shit about your upcoming litter I 've made you with this assignment do n't make me break you
You 'll need your confidence I promise you
You 've never built in Africa
build the bridge over the Tsavo river And be finished in four months time Can you do that
My wife is the game player in the family sir
Then why do it
You 're certain about tomorrow But you do n't seem excited
I know it 's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey but what are you going to do about it
Then why do you stay
You intend sorting this out tonight
then he feasted on him starting with his feet
A man-eater attacks and you 're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it
You never had it
Then we agree
I suppose I could answer you I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting what with the smell of blood and flesh that they have to strike It 's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they 're already contemplating feasting here But I do n't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I do n't have the least idea what I am doing that I am nothing but an incompetent that I am a fool Anyone who finds me a fool please say so now
is it I 'm sorry but then of course you 're the doctor you should know
I am desperate to see Africa but I hate the leaving
not what if there will be there always are Which only means that our son and I note my confidence will have an excuse to come visit
oh please if I 'd been against your taking this you would have abandoned me You 've been desperate to see Africa your whole life
Oh dear you 're geting that downtrodden look again
Tell me about Beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are how lucky he is to have you
I tried to be late John it would have been easier if you 'd gone
well of course he kept moving but he could n't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing
Not once you did n't hit it once
All right you 'll spend your nights inside You 'll have plenty of ammunition You 're totally protected you have really nothing to fear
Very good indeed
You mean nobody died
But it 's crazy the lion should n't be that hungry this soon Samuel
Second death Where
But you said they were always old
Nigel you 'll just have to use your hands
In your honor Nigel And you and Singh will be in charge of building them and you 'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and you 'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks
All right thee second embankment will go there
Are n't we full of ourselves today I think it 's because of the lion
true enough but without the comedy relief
So that 's what a lion looks like
Not to terrify you Nigel but it 's worse than you think I 've never even seen one
What
That is precisely my plan but back in my tent
I 'm sure you mean that to be comforting but
I hate to be a bother John but the cramp 's getting worse The pain is actually quite unbearable now
I 'd love the company And I 've hunted all my life
Might be exciting for you
We know three things about man-eaters First they always return to where they 've attacked before Second they 're always old they ca n't catch other animals so they turn to us And third they 're always alone they 've been cast out by their pride because they ca n't keep up
Well he put me in a spot did n't he But that 's all right after all I 'm responsible for everything that happens here And it certainly wo n't do much for morale if a man-eater 's on the prowl
Yes but their suffering is only transitory once they except God into their hearts He will vanquish all pain
Finish your tour
Excellent Could I see the bridge site
Samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts
We all have our reasons Mine is simply to make them understand happiness accept salvation know the serenity that comes best I stop One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring But I know God smiles on me
Every time I see something like that I know we 're right to be here to bring Christianity into their lives enrich their souls
I 've lived in Africa a year and I do n't know what you know How long have you been here
Anything special about them
Do n't much like them
He just gave me his monster speech
Actually I could have done it much more easily without you but for whatever reason I 'm glad you came
I never thought I 'd say this but I 'm glad you came
How many do you think they 've killed
Why
You think they 'll come then Why
Was that supposed to make me feel better
I 'll have to
I 'll be bait alone
They 're used to people in trees not in a clearing It may be tight
Where could it have gone How could it get across the water They 're only lions yes
Their den Have you ever seen anything like this
What happened to them
You just got hit The getting up is up to you but they 're only lions and I 'm going after them crack of dawn
In point of fact it didn't but I 'm convinced the idea is sound
Meant to ask you the railroad car trap Your idea Excellent notion I used the same device myself once
Goddammit
Have you ever failed
do n't know
misfire it jammed
It was probably luck I 'd rather you did the shooting
I can try
No but you do see you were needed after all And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
I 'm always considerate my mother taught me that
I do n't really But understand something even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out when I 'm gone you 'll still have to build the bridge And I do n't want the men to have lost respect for you
All right let 's go into battle I 'm Redbeard
Let me save time you are the engineer you are in charge you 're sorry I 'm here Right so far Good because I am not an engineer I do n't want to be in charge and I 'm sorrier than you are that I 'm here I hate Tsavo So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave See any problems
Nonsense Samuel would have done something
What did I do
It 's all right Samuel we all get hit
Underneath Somewhere
Once
I feel the same about the bridge This country certainly did n't ask for it does n't need it
He does n't He needs nobody But we have hunted many times he knows I am afraid of lions
Since his beard was red
Oh yes But it takes time
I have to ask why do you need me
You give me hope John
Do you love her
Good news
For you
Oh yes I think so
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area Fires burning at night
Nonsense
What are they looking at
I am also liaison between these two
Did it look like this in your mind
The workers do n't get on
It 's all wonderfully under control Samuel you 've done a splendid job
Why do the workers look unhappy
Some mysteries should not have solutions
Help finish the railroad
Where do you go next
And where will you sleep beautifully
Not even close What happened
Because I have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men
They will want a lot of money
How many cattle
Why do you laugh you do n't believe she taught me
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other Think about it
I know Marry me Dana and together we will raise Vigo as our son There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god I 'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment And perhaps a car and free parking
Time is running out Dana Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine and Vigo 's Well mainly Vigo 's But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship
Not in this case my dear Take a look That 's not Gainsborough 's Blue Boy up there He 's Vigo
I do n't believe we have the luxury of choice
No harm will come to the child You might even say it 's a privilege He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo And you well you will be the mother of the ruler of the world Does n't that sound nice
Oh I 'm sorry This is Peter Venkman Peter Janosz Poha
Good night Janosz
No everything 's fine Honestly Thanks anyway
Hello Dana I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I 'd stop by to see if everything 's all right with you you know with the blackout and everything Are you okay Is the baby all right
Okay I 'll take a raincheck on that
Every day I ask you and every day you 've got something else to do Do I have bad breath or something
We 'll be very sorry to lose you Perhaps I could take you to lunch today
You know you are really doing very good work here I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations
Thank you
Egon I 'd rather you did n't mention any of this to Peter if you do n't mind
This is my address and telephone number Will you call me
Does he ever mention me
How is he these days
Do you ever see him
Okay whatever you think but not Venkman
I 'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field It 's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters
I 'm not saying you did In science we always look for the simplest explanation
That 's exactly what you said last week
No you did n't Frank
Thank you Frank Oh are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom I asked you last week

Peter the bathtub tried to eat Oscar
I 'm sorry Were you on your way out
Good-bye Peter
Yeah it 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to hang in the rec room You know what it needs A fluffy little white kitten in the corner

Hello Peter
Sorry
I think we hit the honeypot boys There 's something brewing under the street
Is this the spot
No problem Always glad to help and hug
No you ca n't and I think that 's the whole problem with aliens you just ca n't trust them You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard Anyway we 're just about out of time Next week on 'World of the Psychic hairless pets Until then this is Peter Venkman saying Good night
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn
Valentine 's Day That 's got to be a bummer Where did you get that date Elaine

Now you 're talking
Yeah I think the Times might be interested do n't you The Post might have a lot of fun with it too
Look you stay away from the mayor Next fall barring a disaster he 's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends You read me
I know who you are Doctor Venkman Busting any ghosts lately
I 'm Jack Hardemeyer I 'm the mayor 's assistant What can I do for you
Can I help you
Oh yeah sure no But there 's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum
You 're right We should stay
Should we go
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me I 'd like to have a baby myself Would n't you
You 're really good with children Louis I can tell Why do n't you come here and sit with me
It 's really not a bad place It just needs a woman 's touch
I ca n't believe a person could actually live like this
I 'd like to but I told Dr Venkman I 'd babysit Do you want to babysit with me
Well good night Louis
No I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first That way I beat the crowds
Oh no it 's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt
I was trying to get that smelly green thing The guys asked me to help out I 'm like the fifth Ghostbuster
Oh migod I 'm sorry I did n't mean to do that It was an accident
Who are you going to call
It 's that darn ghost again I do n't know what to do anymore He just wo n't leave us alone I guess we 'll just have to move
Oh Johnny Did you back the wrong horse
Not Do n't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities We 'll be back
I 'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory If she says it looked at her it looked at her Hey you Vigie Look at me I 'm talking to you Hey Look at me when I 'm talking to you
This is the one that looked at Dana
You know I never got to ask you Where you from Johnny
Then why have you come
Dr Venkman Dana is not here
I 'll let you get back to it Nice meeting you
We do n't go around altering valuable paintings Dr Venkman
Too bad for the Moldavians
How are you What 's that you 're working on Johnny
So be it On this the day of darkness she will be ours wife to you and mother to me
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year Bring me the child that I might live again
I command you
the sorrow of Moldavia
I Vigo the scourge of Carpathia
Command me lord
You 've got to stop them Please
Maybe they just want to appeal
Who are they
Sorry your Honor but when somebody sets me up like that I ca n't resist
Did I forget something
Your honor ladies and gentlemen of the audience I do n't think it 's fair to call my clients frauds Okay the blackout was a big problem for everybody I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time but I do n't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me Thank you
Can I have some of your water
Your honor may I approach the bench
Sustained Mr Tully do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case
The witness is leading him Sustained
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster
Hi it 's really great to meet you guys I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that
Then you should go to the police I do n't believe in any of that stuff
Yeah I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year Forget it Louis I could get in a lot of trouble
You were the one who got me in
Like what
I 'm a dermatologist I ca n't write orders on the psych ward
I ca n't do it Louis It is n't ethical I could lose my license
Well for your sake I hope you 're right But I think my other guest may disagree with you Elaine you had another date in mind
This year That 's cutting it a little close is n't it I mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right So you 're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year And it 's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe
Okay so can you tell us when it 's going to happen or do we have to buy the book
Hi welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic I 'm Peter Venkman and I 'm chatting with my guest author lecturer and of course psychic Milton Anglund Milt your new book is called The End of the World Is n't that kind of like writing about gum disease Yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it
So what are you saying That the world of the supernatural is your special province
I 'll ask you again Dr Venkman Why were you digging the hole And please remember that you 're under oath
So Dr Venkman please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street
Yes I did We were city champs
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland
It 's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country
I 'm worried The vibrations could shake her to pieces We should have padded her feet
They love you Lib Keep it up
This wo n't wait until tomorrow Venkman It 's hot and it 's ready to pop
Roach breeding Sounds better and better Dana The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead
It 's a rough translation from the Moldavian
A hundred and five years He really hung on did n't he
You need the exercise
I knew that
Finding something abnormal on the street should n't be too hard
What now Brainiac
I 'd like to have a stool specimen
I think they 're more interested in my epididymis
Hello Venkman
Do it Just do it
Something good
We need something that everyone can get behind a symbol
It wo n't work There 's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell
If you two are looking for a fight you got one Who wants it first Come on Ray Try me sucker
That 's it It 's on the bottom
This guy was a bad monkey He dabbled in all the Black Arts and listen to this prophecy Just before his head died his last words were Death is but a door time is but a window I 'll be back

It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source
His nickname is The Hammer
What 's the reading
The New York Pneumatic Railway It was an experimental subway system Fan-forced air-trains built around 1870
Nothing Not a trace
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis
Some crank Looking for goat hooves Come up with anything
There 's something very familiar about this painting
And it 's all flowing toward the museum
No the slime is rising
I 'd put my money on that Vigo character
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes
Me I 'm a little of everything Some Irish some German some French Dutch the women in my family slept around And that 's what made this country great
Oh right you told me that They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese as I recall How about you Winston

Are you kidding We 'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th I 'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth Trust me I used to drive a cab
Only one way to find out Ready Teddy
Good effort Now what Should we say supportive nurturing things to it Ray
I hate Jello
It 's all over the city Pete well under it actually
You should 've been there Venkman Absolutely incredible
I think we 're going to have to pass on the sewer trip boys Let me know what you find out
We 're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow We thought you might want to come along
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver 's license
I 'll get one more reading
Nothing Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger 's Magicians Martyrs and Madmen Listen to this
You 're not sleeping with this stuff are you
What kind of tests
Like a goat on garbage
This is an incredible breakthrough Venkman A psychoreactive substance Whatever this is it clearly responds to human emotional states
No I 'm just restoring it to its normal state
It 's not that thing you do with your nostrils is it
If he was n't dead he 'd be an Olympic prospect
I guess so Pete because that 's not all Tell them what else we 've got Egon
Careful Winston He 's a mean one And to celebrate our grand reopening we 're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back service plan
I 'm Ray
Geez I forgot how heavy these things are
Hey hey hey stresshound Are you nuts If anybody found out about this we 'd be in serious trouble The judge could n't have been clearer no ghostbusting
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs giga electron volts
It 's an interesting one Pete If anything was going on it 's totally subdued now
Dana Dana Barrett

Are you all right
I know It happened by itself
You 're quite a housekeeper

Nothing Is that the kitchen
That 's too bad
Like a used car salesman
You really do n't act like a scientist
That 's a violin concerto
Really Do you have a favorite piece
No If I moved out now I 'd be acknowledging that what happened was real I 'm not ready to do that
Spengler see if you can find the word Zuul in any of the literature I 'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment

The EPA What 's he want

Mr Mayor it 's a pretty simple choice You can believe Mr Pecker here
The man is a psychopath Your Honor
You turned off the power Look there was another man here You have to find him and bring him back A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie
At ease Officers I 'm Peter Venkman I think there 's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can
Have it your way Mr Venkman
Well because I 'm curious I want to know more about what you do here Frankly there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation For instance the storage of noxious possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement Now either you show me what 's down there or I come back with a court order
May I please see the storage facility
And what is the magic word Mr Venkman
And why not Mr Venkman
And may I see this storage facility
And would this storage facility be located on these premises
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them
And how many ghosts have you caught Mr Venkman
I see And now you catch ghosts
Exactly what are you a doctor of Mr Venkman
Are you Peter Venkman
I 'm Walter Peck I represent the Environmental Protection Agency Third District

Life is just a state of mind
No Them Shoot them Cross the beams
Full-stream with strogon pulse
Get a grip on yourself Egon I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor
Gozer
She said he was the Destructor
Let me guess Gozer Worshippers
Oh shit
If you turn that thing off we wo n't be responsible for the consequences
All right Peter Good night
All right I 'll try
I agree
Some I just met the Keymaster He 's here with me now Venkman Are you there
Does she want to be
What is it
It 's hard to explain but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension
Trust me It will be bad
Do n't cross the beams
Wait Wait There 's something I forgot to tell you
Something was definitely here
Did you see anything
Generally you do n't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance What do you think Egon
Just for your information Ray the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over 75,000
I 'm always serious
Egon somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head Do you remember that
What have you got Egon
That appears to be the case
And look at this Peter Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores
The storage facility blew This one shut off the protection grid
I 'm worried Ray It 's getting crowded in there And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom
I 've got to sleep
Set entry grid
It 's working
Ray Where are you Are you all right
Sorry Buddy
I just realized something We 've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment
You know Peter this could be a past life experience intruding on the present
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda
Look

It does n't seem to have slowed him down any
Who was the architect
I guess they do n't build them like they used to huh
Egon how 's the grid around the storage facility holding up
Boy that was a rough one
How do you know
It 's here Ray It 's looking at me
Sit tight I 'm on my way
Where are you Pete
All right Let 's cool the negative vibes These things can sense them
I 'm getting high readings near the air vents It must be using the duct system to get around See I told you we 'd get something
No sense worrying about it now
Do you know when that might be We 're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem
It was n't a date It was an investigation
Good idea Were any other words spoken that you remember
Fourteen hundred
Everybody can relax I found the car How do you like it

But most people are afraid to even report these things
You 're not going to lose the house Everybody has three mortgages these days
You 'll never regret this Ray
For what purpose
Do you know what a patent clerk makes I liked the University They gave us money they gave us the facilities and we did n't have to produce anything I 've worked in the private sector They expect results You 've never been out of college You do n't know what it 's like out there
This is like a major disgrace Forget M.I.T or Stanford now they would n't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod
You said you floored 'em at the Regents meeting
If anyone deserves it it 's Spengler and me We 're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment
Oh yeah This could be bigger than the microchip They 'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us We 're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady
Get her That was your whole plan You call that science
Hey Lady Lady Can you talk Who are you This is not working Think of something else
What do I say
What do we do now
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly
Uh-huh I 've heard about the rockfall Ray I think you 've been spending too much time with Spengler
Looked at with your eyes
Ray as your friend I have to tell you I think you 've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff You 've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he 's had an experience And what have you seen
No this one 's for real Peter Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings Right off the top of the scale Buried the needle We 're close this time I can feel it
Peter at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue ten people witnessed a free-roaming vaporous full-torso apparition It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away Scared the socks off some poor librarian
What do you mean choose We do n't understand
LATER MAN
Right We 'll believe anything
Well has it ever occurred to you that the reason you 've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves
Yeah Judgement Day
Right And the sky would fall
Ray do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves
Me too Parts of the Bible are great
Do you believe in God
Me too
Are you a Christian Ray
Hey man What is it you 're so involved with there
Very impressive resume Electronic countermeasures Strategic Air Command Black belt in Karate Small arms expert Mr Zeddemore as you may have heard we locate ghosts and spirits trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people 's homes offices and places of worship
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands
Do you want posters too
Send them out
I am their hero
I want that bastard dead
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger
Yes Go on
But I get what I want always do n't I
Now that we 're done with that infatuation forever
Now that is a happy sound Tomorrow I want the citizens my people back in the arena The Gods know I 'm tired Come to bed now tonight we 're celebrating
What is that wailing
You must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers
Where have you been
You 're coming back
You ca n't do that You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you
Why not do it in the Colosseum
If I may be so bold
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father Except that he ca n't heave out his ghost
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house If it 's worth something then sell it
Let some time pass then ask quietly without anyone knowing it comes from me
I 'm sure I do n't know
If you get me pregnant with a boy he 'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne
Maybe you should get married Pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability
Why Then they 'll notice when I 'm gone Well I 'm making a public appearance are n't I
And Caesar Let 's not forget to serve Caesar
Oh stay Do n't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus glory Just remember he is a married man
More wine sister Surely you can drink more than that
Will you please get back in your wagon And stay there
We 're nearly there Lucilla
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army march on Rome and depose you Then the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again
On what charge
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube
Where is my family
They wo n't break this one
We have to stop the Germans now
That this illness has clouded his mind
Being as close I 'm certain you 've noticed what we all have noticed
You and my father have become very close Perhaps one day I may say the same for us
But they 're not destroyed not yet
I would say there 's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right is
I back Rome against all her enemies if that answer disappoints you I 'm not a politician
Gladly Caesar
Perhaps Master Galen you may say
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience
Respectfully Caesar Quintus and I must report
I would n't know who to bet on
Make a gift to the people It 's your money anyway so it 's only fair
Sacks of grain even bread I own the grain licenses for the military I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube
We can crush Gaius another way What if you do throw something to the people they really want Make them a gift of food
I 'm serious
Yes You know that 's not a bad idea
At the opening of the month of Janus I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship
Until your confirmation date
At least stay for the running of the animals You are paying for it you know
Caesar ignore them
The Senate is out to sink you I swear it Caesar your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you
Insubordination To the Emperor and the Senate
Underdog How can he be an underdog he wins all the time I 'm the emperor why ca n't I kill him He could be poisoned or somehow killed to look like an accident
Narcissus will never support you Caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament
I met with Falco and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans
He left us at dawn
I 'm certain father will be in better humors by then Now honor us with your presence at dinner I 'll join you as soon as I see my father 's physician
We need more statues perhaps I should open medical clinics For the poor Citizens only though
Tribuus Go left here I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia
Yes Caesar
Why is n't he dead Damn you you promised me he would be dead
Tribuus what happened in the arena Was Narcissus killed
Where is my father
I 'll nose around
I do n't know
Commodus he 's a gladiator is he mad
I 'm mentioning you in tomorrow 's athlete 's section legate So I 'd love to know your birth sign it effects how people bet And perhaps you could tell me a bit about well who are you
You won an impossible fight You got the attention of the crowd legate
It 's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border It 's time to tell the citizens everything Will you write it
That makes his birth sign Virgo Why that 's the sign of a little girl Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed
I am prepared to write anything you tell me
So tell me what happened between you and the emperor What really happened on the German front You know the Senate 's arguing your case
But have never been
You know general there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace Sadly it has remained open for three hundred years
God of passages and changes
I hope you live to see what I believe
The Senate too
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right is
Yes The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over thanks to your father Now report to the Senate Master Galen what is Marcus state
You do n't know how wrong you are
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen
You 're hearing about somebody else
They ca n't if this is Rome
That 's what worries me
My loyalties were in doubt
You on your way to trial too general Or do you think they 've already had our trial
Where are they
He killed his father and then my family
Would that Marcus had lived
But what if I wish to be purple
Do you remember your Epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans
For the sake of the Gods you 're not leading these men How like my father you are You 'believe I guess that 's why you 're still alive
But you do exist Narcissus hero of the battle of the Danube
I came here to see that you stay alive The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus a hero
It 's my brother 's neck you want not mine
I do n't believe that He 's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron You know we 're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany
Why do you play at being drunk
I 'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I 'm not taking the job
Sneaking around with your brother
Only from a distance
Narcissus Terrified You The only thing he 's scared of is me
I 'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I ca n't be that power
They fear me
Marcus you honor me but I 'm a soldier politics scare the hell out of me
You 're too hard on him He is a strong young man with you as his guide
So I understand
Commodus is just a young man he 'll learn what you had to learn
He 's like you sir too tough for the Gods to swallow
There 's no reason to say that Everyone knows you 're going to be well I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light
I will Marcus But you 're going to be well enough to direct it yourself
AURELIUS Commodus listen to Narcissus listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome You 're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple
AURELIUS Commodus it 's we who are going on the offensive
On your honor as a Roman officer daddy
Tomorrow
Much more colorful than the ones we wear And of course less dented
Can you stop that slaughter Can you free these men
The 'people listen to the people they know what they want A government that gives them what they need and does n't bother them with messy thoughts of issues You know messy thinking They want a dictator As far as the children there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of being you A famous gladiator
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand Narcissus the Republic is dead You think those Senators could govern For the last hundred and fifty years they 've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses
It 's my job to keep my job And that by the way is now head of Praetorian Guard Good ole Tribuus has been retired
I was summoned
I ca n't let you do that
Well they die for it
Rome is going to pay tribute like a defeated nation begging for mercy Have you told your troops that
What deal
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive They 've got nothing to lose and it 's so very like them
Well we can try
What the hell do you think it was about There 's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others
Let 's hope he does n't start giving orders
That 's what I 'm going to do That 's what I 'm going to do
They 'll have me Teach them Do n't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history without philosophy without meaning Teach them of the Greeks the Babylonians the Hebrews the Numidians the Egyptians and the great Romans Teach them who we are
I 'll never die You tell the girls that You honor our ancestors and I 'll be there Every night At the table of life
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered If I die fighting Commodus he wo n't care about you If I live I 'll come and get you
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he 's in power A month Half a year Paestum will be a prison where he 'll hold us until it 's time
No
What you do n't want to imagine is the things I 've done
Me Well I believe in Rome you 'd have to after what I 've seen how people outside the empire treat each other
Quintus is overly idealistic
I want to come home of course I do I 'd have to be mad not to want that It 's just that Marcus trusts me
I 'm a soldier we 're at war I ca n't stay home tending the damned olive groves
Very fancy Did you design the bottle
This is our oil from our estates
The battle is over The war is over You 've won
You need to come home
They 're studying with Cynics
Athenians
Well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers
He 's very realistic
Commodus must hate you Free your gladiators and come with us
I want nothing to do with the arena
Was I
So things change The government has moved to the circus You 're going to fight last And Commodus is going to fight first
I want another interview with Cos Tell him to bring plenty of ink
Before they leave get gold
Then get a large cash advance
No Tell them I 'll do it But I want more posters all over Rome
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right They do n't waste time
How much money is involved
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth Take my advice and make that bet
Tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting if this were a fair fight where would you put your money
Pressures on eh Proximo There 's got to be a load of money in this Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins I do n't know Proximo who has better wine than you Besides I 'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home
As what 'The Galloping Gladiator
So I pretend I 'm dead You get gold what do I get
What the hell are you talking about Greek
Make us rich Proximo make us very rich
Lucky it did n't step on his head
Do n't be ridiculous
Alive I 'm alive
Think about it Just think about it
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company Small but profitable They asked if you would endorse their oil We could get some very nice posters Make some very big money
I did n't get killed and everyone else did
Then you 'll die Just know this because you asked I asked I 'm sorry but
Legate Narcissus Meridas general of the Spanish Felix Legions I 'm proud to have you in my school Now show them what you can do
I refuse to be your slave I refuse
Chain him
Death is everything for me Now you have to go to your cell and I to dicker with Jerses you 'll be fed well I want you to be fit as you can be I want you to win for me tomorrow I want all my gladiators to win and be happy Besides I 've never owned a Roman general before
You are to be killed exactly They 'll give you a sporting chance but just enough to make your murder entertaining Romans like to mix their metaphors laughter with their executions you know If you survive though you will become a gladiator A gladiator at least gets a fair fight
Impossible Every citizen has a right to trial this is Rome
Condemned Are n't I owed a trial before being condemned
Who the hell are you
I killed too many barbarians
What
Maybe we are and maybe we are n't
No
Where did he do it
Oh no He said that
Well what did he say I 'm curious
How did he do it Did he get down on his knees He did n't get down on his knees I hope
Why do you have to see him
Who that guy at the Zoo
Carl who
Well I have to see Carl first
Why do n't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much
Why would n't it
I just do n't think it would work
Benjamin I have n't even said I 'll marry you yet
Tomorrow
Yes
I 'll think about it

Please let me go
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night
Because it is n't true
You 've got to tell me what she said

Well I want you to leave

ROBINSON Art
ROBINSON Why are you asking me all this
ROBINSON Yes
ROBINSON Yes
Was he a law student at the time
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances
Wait a minute Wait a minute So how did it happen

I ca n't see why you did unless you did n't have to marry him or anything did you
Well I ca n't
Why did you do that
ROBINSON I never did Benjamin Now let 's
ROBINSON No
I mean it does n't sound like it could be much worse If you hated him at least you 'd hate him
Well that 's kind of a bad situation then is n't it
Well how do you feel about him then
But you do n't hate him
Wait a minute So you would n't say you loved him
So you do n't love him You would n't say you
Man is this interesting
How many times a year
You have not slept with your husband for five years
Oh no Are you kidding me
Well how long has this been going on
So you do n't I mean I do n't like to seem like I 'm prying but I guess you do n't sleep together or anything

I 'll not denounce you
You may keep the pearls I do n't want them any more I 'll make you a present of them
There
Please look at me You must believe me you must believe that I love you that I have never known what love is until last night
I 'm also a criminal and a hotel thief
I 'm a gambler I 'm running at large like a happy pig devouring anything of life that pleases me I really belong in jail
And then in the war to kill and hide That 's all
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman at school it was a monastery I learned to pray and lie and
Really I have n't a bit of character None at all
I 'm a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock I shall die on the gallows
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern My mother called me Flix
That is not the truth You do not want to be alone you 're afraid of being alone I know you 're afraid I know you You were desperate just now if I go away you 'll be more desperate than ever Say I am to stay with you say it
The veronal you I 'm going to stay here with you
I 'm not going You know that I 'm not going Do you think I could leave you alone here After that
No
What can you see
Why do you smile
I see you do only what you take pleasure in doing You take pleasure in coming into a woman 's bedroom and you come You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony so you do it And what is your pleasure now
The stage frays one 's nerves the discipline it 's so exacting Discipline means doing what you do n't want to do and take no pleasure in doing Do you know what I mean Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline
No You do n't want to be alone at all You were in despair before If I left you you 'd feel worse than you did before You must not be alone You must n't cry you must forget Tell me that I can stay with you tell me
That is not so you do n't want to be alone
I 'm not going You know I 'm not going Let me stay here
Yes I do understand
I saw you just now then I saw you cry and now I see you in the mirror Grusinskaya
A man who could love that is all who has forgotten everything else for you
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman 's room when she 's alone
And
Am I quite strange to you
You must n't talk Russian to me
So alone
How tired you are
No irony You 're so appealing so soft so tired I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever
I did not know you were so beautiful and
Certainly
So you feel like coming into a lady 's room and you come What now
Nerves just nerves You must forgive me I have had a bad evening I am very tired Do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence
I was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that No I am not afraid It is strange
Because you love me you love me
Why do you hide in my room
What do you want here
Oh no stay here Baron stay
No no please oh do n't go do n't go do n't leave me alone Baron
Oh yes that 's it you found it you found it for me Baron

Indeed you must Baron you must Humm humm but you must go to jail Baron you 're a thief
So that 's how we stand Baron
I must have made a mistake
As you will

Oh let the poor devil alone
Pardon me the lady has urgent business here with me
I do n't believe it he was a real gentleman I know people I 'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel that means a lot of work But it 's too bad about the Baron you always felt better when he came along always friendly such an agreeable fellow
Man that 's terrible He was a nice fellow I am sorry about him
Good heavens What for

All right
I mean with the Manchester people
There 's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company They 've the whole English market right in their hands Have you any connections with Manchester

Does the world belong to you Mr Preysing
Some champagne Miss Flaemm
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf and here you are in Berlin indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means Quite extraordinary Mr Kringelein I think we will look into your books

I do n't know you
I certainly have a complaint and a fair one
No I wo n't wait I ca n't Every day is precious every hour Every minute

Yes I must go to England I was desperate Now I do n't care This sort of thing goes to a man 's head
No one would have thought it of me I 've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf Well if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone From now on
That
Bluff Bluff all bluff
You let me talk till I 'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time Why
Well gentlemen
But the situation is perfectly clear If you will allow me
Good morning gentlemen I see the conference is already underway
I 'll see you in the morning then at the conference Everything 'll be all right Preysing Do n't worry Goodnight
Well do n't get excited about it We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through
Good heavens no That 'd create the very worst impression You must be optimistic You must convince them You know as well as I do that the merger must go through
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter
Everything depends on the Manchester merger
No news yet
Have I kept you waiting
I will So long Bobo
Well you can tell them I said they 're right I better get going Roy 'll wonder where I am
You know I like that suit Bobo I do n't know what there is about it but it somehow makes you look taller
Or else he 's working an angle If he does n't steal a little he 's steeling big
A person that do n't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else He 's a liability right Bobo
Oh well you know I just clip a buck here and a buck there Not enough to notice
On the square huh And how are you making out these days Stealing much
See your son huh Well that 's nice A side of you I did n't know Lilly
You want a drink

You work for me huh Then I just may flush you down the toilet Drive me to the Durando
Did I buy you that dress you piece of shit
No problem My husband gets up the crack of dawn It 's his kidneys
Fine

Do you have something around back facing away from the road
I 'm a very light sleeper traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night
Good evening I 'd like a single for tonight
Hah

It 's all hollow Nothing behind it
Ca n't move
Henry no
We 're not really interested Henry
Oh Henry no that 's just boring
Mister Hebbing we are talking about breaking the law here I want to be sure you understand that No one gets hurt but the law does get broken
Well If Mary Beth vouches for you and if she told you the story already
Mary Beth This has never been anything but
Goody
Well of course not I know how dangerous this is But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything Would n't I darling
Oh I told Mister Hebbing all about it how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients
You brought a case Good
Here you are Two rich people
Seven seconds I do n't see how you do it
Not much time
Well you 've got your information ahead of New York I see that
One of those computer geniuses is n't it
I can keep my mouth shut Mister Fellowes
I certainly hope not
Well that 's what the law 's for is n't it
Yes yes but that 's
His blood pressure is under a hundred I do n't think he 'll live to get to the hospital
Mrs Dillon your son was in some sort of accident He 's had an internal hemorrhage he 's bleeding to death inside
The ambulance is on the way for what good it will do
Take two three days Call when you get there
Nine hundred Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time Come on Lilly you do n't argue with Bobo
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar
Well I 'd have to see it of course
You 'll give us an opportunity to serve you again I hope If there 's anything you think we might be interested in
I hope you 're not too badly disappointed with us Mrs Langtry
All right
It was a gift It is n't worth anything at all
But they must be They cut glass
What is
But what 's wrong
Why What 's wrong
Fair enough
Oh I 'd like to stay on Just keep everything the way it was
Maybe I 'm just not ready for that yet
Okay fine Perk the truth is I like things the way they are now Pick my own hours have time for uh other activities
The truth is Mr Kaggs
I guess I 'm just not a leader of men
Mr Kaggs I 'm sorry
Perk
Oh sure Fine
Well
But you need a man right now It would n't be fair to you to
I ca n't take that job I mean I mean I ca n't take it right away I 'm still recuperating I just dropped in to say hello see everybody
Well uh No
What Me
Sounds like a good Idea
Just myself
So I heard
Lead on
That was a pretty backhanded compliment If I let people get away with things like that I would n't be a good salesman
I know that Knew it when I saw you out there The best salesman here which is n't saying much Want to talk to you Dillon
Kaggs Home office
Whadaya say
Is there nothing I can do Roy nothing at
I have to have that money Roy What do I have to do to get it
What
Just trying to help Lilly
That money would n't last forever And then what You 'd be back in some other part of the rackets Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands This way you 've got to go the square route You could send me a card when you 're settled I could maybe help out sometimes
If I should get out of the racket that goes double for you That 's why you 've got to change your life completely go to some town get a square job live like a john yourself If you try to do it your way what future is in it
And that 's why you 've got to get rid of this money If you keep it around it 'll just make you think how clever you are It 'll be a temptation to get back into the game
Sure sure that does n't count That 's different
Well I guess I got it wrong then Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him
If you stayed a crook do you think you 'd live to be my ripe age
That 's good You do n't really belong on this side of the fence you know
You 're getting off the grift
I gave you your life twice I 'm asking you to give me mine once I need the money
And making you feel bad at the same time huh But that 's the way I am you know the way I 've always been Always picking on poor little Roy
No I guess not It was pretty lousy of me I guess to be a child at the same time you were Not to stop being a child just because I had a child I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side
A bad mother By any standards I 've thought about it you know from your side since then I know just how bad I was
Oh really You 've got a legitimate complaint Roy I do n't deny that I was n't a very good mother when you were a kid
I know what 's bugging you of course
You do n't know what I 'd do Roy You have no idea To live
Yeah sure that sounds nice
I do n't think so You probably should n't either
No
I know you do so that 's why
I thought you 'd be happy for me After all you
I thought it over and you were right You wanted me out of the rackets and now
Not any more Lilly listen I 'm giving you good advice I 'm following it myself
Well you 're gon na start if you hope to live through this A square job and a quiet life You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo 's boys will be all over you
You 're smart Lilly and you 're good-looking You wo n't have any trouble finding a job
Far enough Maybe up to San Francisco Or St Louis someplace new Start over
And Myra 's stuff
You must have some money

The last I looked we were just talking things over
Wait a minute When did this happen that we 're partners
And hello to you too
You mean it would be too tough to give me a turndown here Easier on home grounds
But why not I thought it was settled What 's holding you back
You and me Roy What a team we 'll make We think alike we get along together Once or twice a year we take some slob the rest of the time we live like this You wo n't regret this Roy
I 'm well connected Roy Cole introduced me to a lot of people Very valuable Valuable for us
I 'm not trying to make trouble Roy It 's just she 's always so nasty to me I thought who is she to be so high and mighty I saw her out there and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore so now I know who she is
I saw her
I went out to Delmar
Oh come here
You I do n't know
What What for
Yeah
You do n't mind really do you Roy It 's been such a wonderful evening I guess I just wore myself out
Separate bathrooms darling I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over
Sure
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand
I need a partner Roy I need an inside man and you 're it You could be as wonderful as Cole
Join up with you I watched you Roy I 've been watching you wondering if I should talk about this at all or maybe just
That 's where they keep the criminally insane is n't it
Upstate where
Where
What happened to Cole
Yeah How
And a month later the sucker calls the cops and you 're on the run
I thought these people were broke
And when he got serious
It is Roy And now right now it 's the perfect time the best time since I 've been in the game
It was beautiful And getting better all the time
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business Cole Langley
The long end Big con
Roy you 're a short-con operator And a good one I think Do n't talk to me like I 'm another square
You 're on the grift Same as me

Great to get away take it easy Next week I 'll get back to work
You were right I had to get out of that hospital Nothing wrong with me any more
No
Big spender
What if we want to drive somewhere while we 're there
I do n't see why we have to take the train
Every day in every way
You 're a mama 's boy if you want the truth
And you never defend me You 're afraid of her
I do n't like to come here Roy Every time I do your mother comes in and makes remarks
Who else is paying for all this You badmouth the woman all the time but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you
You 're just comfortable that 's all You do n't even ask to go home You just lie around let your mama take care of you
I do n't see why you 're still here You look healthy to me
I want to know everything about you
Oh yeah Thanks How long do they say I 'm in here
You called the doctor huh
No baby Come to Mama
I did n't say that You are n't marriage material
No more than this
Roy It this all we have
Look at me
Roy
Are you sure
Taking you for granite
Always for you baby
Oh yeah That 's that
No its Why did she
Oh Jesus
Not many laughs in this room eh
Someone who knows her well could still identify her that 's not the problem It 's just there 's uh it 's likely to be a shock
I 'm sorry that 's an unfortunate phrase it slipped out I 'm to tell you the truth Mr Dillon this is n't an everyday occurrence around here
Well uh you know she ate the gun
One thing I have to caution you about A gunshot wound
You up to it now
A hit you mean Honestly it does n't have that feel to it but I 'll certainly consider the possibility Thank you for telling me
