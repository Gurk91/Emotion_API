They do not
They do to
I hope so
She okay
Let 's go
Wow
Okay you 're gon na need to learn how to lie
No
I 'm kidding You know how sometimes you just become this persona And you do n't know how to quit
Like my fear of wearing pastels
The real you
What good stuff
I figured you 'd get to the good stuff eventually
Thank God If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure
Me This endless blonde babble I 'm like boring myself
What crap
do you listen to this crap
No
Then Guillermo says If you go any lighter you 're gon na look like an extra on 90210
You always been this selfish
But
Then that 's all you had to say
Well no
You never wanted to go out with 'me did you
I was
I looked for you back at the party but you always seemed to be occupied
Tons
Have fun tonight
I believe we share an art instructor
You know Chastity
Looks like things worked out tonight huh
Hi
Who knows All I 've ever heard her say is that she 'd dip before dating a guy that smokes
So that 's the kind of guy she likes Pretty ones
Lesbian No I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers so I 'm pretty sure she 's not harboring same-sex tendencies
She 's not a
I 'm workin on it But she does n't seem to be goin for him
I really really really wan na go but I ca n't Not unless my sister goes
Sure have
Eber 's Deep Conditioner every two days And I never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment
How do you get your hair to look like that
You 're sweet
You have my word As a gentleman
I counted on you to help my cause You and that thug are obviously failing Are n't we ever going on our date
You got something on your mind
Where
There
Well there 's someone I think might be
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing
Forget French
That 's because it 's such a nice one
I do n't want to know how to say that though I want to know useful things Like where the good stores are How much does champagne cost Stuff like Chat I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone
Right See You 're ready for the quiz
C'esc ma tete This is my head
Let me see what I can do
Gosh if only we could find Kat a boyfriend
That 's a shame
Unsolved mystery She used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
Why
Seems like she could get a date easy enough
The thing is Cameron I 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser My sister I ca n't date until she does
Cameron
No no it 's my fault we did n't have a proper introduction
Forget it
You 're asking me out That 's so cute What 's your name again
Okay then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine Saturday Night
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part Please
Well I thought we 'd start with pronunciation if that 's okay with you
Can we make this quick Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad Again
I did
You think you re the only sophomore at the prom
I do n't have to be home 'til two
I have to be home in twenty minutes
All I know is I 'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we 're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know
Bianca I do n't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding
Combination I do n't know I thought he 'd be different More of a gentleman
Is he oily or dry
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist I mean Dr Bonchowski is great an all but he 's not exactly relevant party conversation
Would you mind getting me a drink Cameron
Great
Joey
Who
Where did he go He was just here
You might wan na think about it
No
Did you change your hair
You know the deal I can t go if Kat does n't go
Listen I want to talk to you about the prom
You 're concentrating awfully hard considering it 's gym class
Hi Joey
Hey sweet cheeks
My agent says I 've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year
Neat
It 's a gay cruise line but I 'll be like wearing a uniform and stuff
Queen Harry
So yeah I 've got the Sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig that 's gon na be huge And then I 'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week
Hopefully
Exactly So you going to Bogey Lowenbrau 's thing on Saturday
Expensive
It 's more
Perm
Patrick is that a
It 's just you
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me
No I just wanted
What To completely damage me To send me to therapy forever What
I just wanted
You set me up
Let go
So did you
You looked beautiful last night you know
I guess I 'll never know will I
Not all experiences are good Bianca You ca n't always trust the people you want to
God you 're just like him Just keep me locked away in the dark so I ca n't experience anything for myself
I guess I thought I was protecting you
I 'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
That 's not
No you did n't If you really thought I could make my own decisions you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
Why did n't you tell me
After that I swore I 'd never do anything just because everyone else was doing it And I have n't since Except for Bogey 's party and my stunning gastro-intestinal display
But
Just once Afterwards I told him I did n't want to anymore I was n't ready He got pissed Then he broke up with me
You did what
He said everyone was doing it So I did it
As in
Now I do Back then was a different story
But you hate Joey
He was like a total babe
Why
In 9th For a month
What
Joey never told you we went out did he
I wish I had that luxury I 'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I ca n't go because you won t
I do care But I 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else s
Like you care
Listen I know you hate having to sit home because I 'm not Susie High School
You 're welcome
I do n't get you You act like you 're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here
I really do n't think I need any social advice from you right now
Bianca I need to talk to you I need to tell you
Can we go now
You are so completely unbalanced
Yeah he 's your freak friend Mandella 's boyfriend I guess since I 'm not allowed to go out I should obsess over a dead guy too
It 's Shakespeare Maybe you 've heard of him
Like I 'm supposed to know what that even means
At least I 'm not a clouted fen sucked hedge-pig
Ca n't you forget for just one night that you 're completely wretched
Bogey Lowenstein 's party is normal but you 're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that
What 's normal
You 're ruining my life Because you wo n't be normal I ca n't be normal
I think you 're a freak I think you do this to torture me And I think you suck
What do you think
Oh I thought you might have a date I do n't know why I 'm bothering to ask but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein 's party Saturday night
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we 're going
Oh my God does this mean you 're becoming normal
Can you at least start wearing a bra
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do n't get out of my way
Nowhere Hi Daddy
Where 've you been
I have a date Daddy And he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
I 'm missing something
Fine I see that I 'm a prisoner in my own house I 'm not a daughter I 'm a possession
You 're not going unless your sister goes End of story
He 's not a hot rod Whatever that is
It 's that hot rod Joey right That s who you want me to bend my rules for
No but
The prom Kat has a date
Daddy I want to discuss the prom with you It 's tomorrow night
Because she 'll scare them away
Why
Promise me you wo n't talk to any boys unless your sister is present
Just for a minute
Daddy no
Wear the belly before you go
It 's just a party Daddy
Oh God It 's starting
If Kat 's not going you 're not going
Daddy people expect me to be there
It 's just a party Daddy but I knew you 'd forbid me to go since Gloria Steinem over there is n't going
Otherwise known as an orgy
If you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
And where 're you going
Daddy I
Exactly my point
But she does n't want to date
But it 's not fair she 's a mutant Daddy
Then neither will you And I 'll get to sleep at night
What if she never starts dating
No You 're not dating until your sister starts dating End of discussion
Now do n't get upset Daddy but there 's this boy and I think he might ask
Just sent 'em through
Padua girls One tall decent body The other one kinda short and undersexed
Never
Fan of a fan You see a couple of minors come in
Did n't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan Are n't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you
Always a pleasure Brucie
Best case scenario you 're back on the payroll for awhile
You humiliated the woman Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score
No I m not
Buttholus extremus But hey you 're making progress
The hell is that What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you 're talking to her
Extremely unfortunate maneuver
Hell I 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
You told me that part already
It 's her favorite band
Assail your ears for one night
Okay I was n't sure
He 's pretty
Dead at forty-one
Her favorite uncle
It 's a lung cancer issue
Number one She hates smokers
Are you kidding He 'll piss himself with joy He 's the ultimate kiss ass
Will Bogey get bent
In that case we 'll need to make it a school-wide blow out
This is it A golden opportunity Patrick can ask Katarina to the party
Like we had a choice Besides when you let the enemy think he 's orchestrating the battle you 're in a position of power We let him pretend he 's calling the shots and while he 's busy setting up the plan you have time to woo Bianca
You got him involved
Hey I 've got ta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street
I thought you hated those people
You know if you do go out with Bianca you 'd be set You 'd outrank everyone Strictly A-list With me by your side
That 's what I just said
Did she actually say she 'd go out with you
Forget his reputation Do you think we 've got a plan or not
I 'm serious man he 's whacked He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology
No kidding He 's a criminal I heard he lit a state trooper on fire He just got out of Alcatraz
He seems like he thrives on danger
What makes you think he 'll do it
You wan na go out with him
What about him
Unlikely but even so she still ca n't go out with you So what 's the point
I teach her French get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
The mewling rampalian wretch herself
That 's her Bianca 's sister
Yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew
You could consecrate with her my friend
You mean I 'd get a chance to talk to her
Guess who just signed up for a tutor
Sure do my Mom 's from Canada
You know French
Joey Dorsey Perma-shit-grin I wish I could say he 's a moron but he 's number twelve in the class And a model Mostly regional stuff but he 's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
He always have that shit-eating grin
Because they 're bred to Their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them Their gene pool is rarely diluted
Why do girls like that always like guys like that
I could start with your haircut but it does n't matter She 's not allowed to date until her older sister does And that 's an impossibility
Why not
Bianca Stratford Sophomore Do n't even think about it
Who is she
You burn you pine you perish
That girl I
Yeah but these guys have never seen a horse They just jack off to Clint Eastwood
That I 'm used to
Couple thousand Most of them evil
How many people go here
Get out
Thirty-two
How many people were in your old school
Yeah A couple We 're outnumbered by the cows though
I was kidding People actually live there
North actually How 'd you
So which Dakota you from
C'mon I 'm supposed to give you the tour
So they tell me
You the new guy
You get the girl
What 's the worst
Where
She kissed me
You makin any headway
She just needs time to cool off I 'll give it a day
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns That 's a direct quote
I don t know I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
What 'd you do to her
Then go get her
Sure
Cameron do you like the girl
She 's partial to Joey not me
What 're you talking about
It 's off The whole thing
Cameron I 'm a little busy
Do n't make me do it man
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night
So what does that give me I 'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who ca n't play their instruments
Okay Likes Thai food feminist prose and angry stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion
I 've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you 'll find helpful
What 've you got for me
Yeah we 'll see
And he means that strictly in a non prison-movie type of way
And why would I do that
Leave my sister alone
Your sister here
Away
Where ya goin
Not at all
Hey do you mind
They 're running the rest of me next month
Yeah and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow Tough break
The vintage look is over Kat Have n't you been reading your Sassy
Enough with the Barbie n Ken shit I know
I do n't know Dorsey the limo.-the flowers Another hundred for the tux
Get her to act like a human
Do what
How 'd you do it
A deal 's a deal
It 's about time
Forget her sister then
Forget it
A hundred bucks a date
What
I just upped my price
I got her under control She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
Watching the bitch trash my car does n't count as a date
I 'm on it
When I shell out fifty I expect results
Fifty and you 've got your man
Take it or leave it This is n't a negotiation
Fine thirty
I ca n't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
How much
I ca n't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend And that 's the catch She does n't want a boyfriend
You 're gon na pay me to take out some girl
You got it Verona I pick up the tab you do the honors
But you 'd go out with her if you had the cake
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
Sure Sparky I 'll get right on it
Yeah whatever I want you to go out with her
Two legs nice rack
What do you think
Yeah
Hey it 's all for the higher good right
You better not fuck this up I 'm heavily invested
What We took bathes together when we were kids
You and Verona
Uh yeah We 're old friend
I hear you 're helpin Verona
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who 'll go out with her Someone who 's up for the job
Does this conversation have a purpose
But she ca n't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her right
We 're not
Well actually I thought I 'd run an idea by you You know just to see if you 're interested
We do n't chat
Nope just came by to chat
Are you lost
Hey
Oh honey tell me we have n't progressed to full-on hallucinations
William he asked me to meet him here
Who
Have you seen him
Oh good Something new and different for us
You re looking at this from the wrong perspective We 're making a statement
Okay okay we wo n't go It 's not like I have a dress anyway
Listen to you You sound like Betty all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica
Well I guess we 're not since we do n't have dates
Can you even imagine Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
I got drunk I puked I got rejected It was big fun
You did n't
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired
You did n't have a choice Where 's Kat and what have you done with her
I did n't have a choice
You went to the party I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
Who cares
What 'd he say
No fear
You think this 'll work
If I was Bianca it would be Any school you want precious Do n't forget your tiara
Does it matter
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but I 'm consuming Do you mind
Neither has his heterosexuality
That 's never been proven
William did n't even go to high school
William would never have gone to a state school
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated puking frat boy number one golf team school I have no say at all
You could always go with me I 'm sure William has some friends
The people at this school are so incredibly foul
But imagine the things he 'd say during sex
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions You 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy
An attempted slit
What 's this
Just a little
Mandella eat Starving yourself is a very slow way to die
Block E
He always look so
I 'm sure he 's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
That 's Pat Verona The one who was gone for a year I heard he was doing porn movies
Patrick Verona Random skid
Who 's that
Don t you even dare
Oh Bianca Can you get me my freshman yearbook
Because I like to torture you
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
Yeah but then I fucked up I fell for her
Is that right
Besides I had some extra cash Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
I thought you could use it When you start your band
A Fender Strat You bought this
I did n't care about the money
Really What was it like A down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
It was n't like that
You were paid to take me out By the one person I truly hate I knew it was a set-up
Wait I
It gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook
That s completely adorable
That 's where I was last year She 'd never lived alone my grandfather died I stayed with her I was n't in jail I do n't know Marilyn Manson and I 've never slept with a Spice Girl I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune End of story
What
My grandmother 's
Look I 'm sorry that I questioned your motives I was wrong
Oh huh
It 's just something I had You know
It 's Scurvy 's His date got convicted Where 'd you get the dress
How 'd you get a tux at the last minute
Nothing There 's nothing in it for me Just the pleasure of your company
Answer the question Patrick
You need therapy Has anyone ever told you that
You tell me
So I have to have a motive to be with you
Create a little drama Start a new rumor What
Because I do n't want to It 's a stupid tradition
Why not
No I wo n't go with you
No what
No
You know what I mean
Is that a request or a command
Go to the prom with me
You 're amazingly self-assured Has anyone ever told you that
No one else knows
What
You 're sweet And sexy And completely hot for me
No something real Something no one else knows
I hate peas
Tell me something true
I know the porn career 's a lie
Hearsay
The duck
Fallacy
State trooper
For
You up for it
You never disappointed me
How
Then you screwed up
Something like that
So if you disappoint them from the start you 're covered
I do n't like to do what people expect Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
Yes
Acting the way we do
So what 's your excuse
Yeah well do n't let it get out
A soft side Who knew
I dazzled him with my wit
So how 'd you get Chapin to look the other way
Good call
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect And piss you off
The Partridge Family
Maybe
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down
Forget it I 'm stayin
Put your right foot there
Try lookin at it from this angle
C'mon It 's not that bad
I guess I never told you I 'm afraid of heights
Look up sunshine
He left I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
Other than my upchuck reflex Nothing
So what did I have an effect on
Do n't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
Unwelcome I guess someone still has her panties in a twist
Unwelcome
Wholesome
Pleasant
You 're so
I heard there was a poetry reading
What are you doing here
Excuse me have you seen The Feminine Mystique I lost my copy
No offense but you 're sister is without I know everyone likes her and all but
BIANCA
Who
He just wants me to be someone I 'm not
So what s up with your dad He a pain in the ass
I 'm gettin there
Oh so now you think you know me
You do n't strike me as the type that would ask permission
My father would n't approve of that that
Start a band
This
Do what
I should do this
Why 'd you lie
Then why 'd you ask
No you were n't
Maybe
Were you in jail
Busy
When you were gone last year where were you
But it 's Gigglepuss I know you like them I saw you there
And I 'm in control of it
What
Kat Wake up
You know what they say
I thought you were above all that
Hey man You don t think I can be cool You do n't think I can be laid back like everyone else
I know It 'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila You do n't seem like the type
I hate him
Dorsey
Who
Why 'd you let him get to you
Just let me sit down
See that Who needs affection when I 've got blind hatred
Like you could find one
Because then I 'd have to start taking out girls who like me
Why
Sure I do
You do n't care if I die
I told you
Why 're you doing this
Leave it to you to use big words when you 're shitfaced
This is so patronizing
What if you have a concussion My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable Not that I could tell the difference
I know just let me sleep
Uh uh You lie down and you 'll go to sleep
I just need to lie down for awhile
You 're not okay
I 'm fine I 'm
Okay
Funny you 're the only one
I say do what you wan na do
I 'm getting trashed man Is n't that what you 're supposed to do at a party
What 's this
Why do n't you
You know who The Raincoats are
You know these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats but they 're right up there
Do you mind You 're sort of ruining it for me
That 's what you want is n't it
Excuse me

hey Great show huh
Depends on the topic My fenders do n't really whip me into a verbal frenzy
You 're not a big talker are you
Hi
I was in the laundromat I saw your car Thought I 'd say hi
Are you following me
Seven-thirty
You covered in my vomit
Come on the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass
And why would I do that
Then say you 'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me
I do n't really think you warrant that strong an emotion
You hate me do n't you
I know a lot more than that
Like where The 7-Eleven on Burnside Do you even know my name screwboy
The night I take you to places you 've never been before And back
Oh right Friday
Pick you up Friday then
My mission in life
There 's a way to get a guy 's attention
Sweating like a pig actually And yourself
I mean Wo-man How ya doin
Oh Christ Do n't tell me you 've changed your mind I already sent 'em a check
When I go
You know fathers do n't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives It means we 've become spectators Bianca still lets me play a few innings You 've had me on the bleachers for years When you go to Sarah Lawrence I wo n't even be able to watch the game
No impressed
What 's the matter Upset that I rubbed off on her
Bianca did what
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy
Which parts
Parts of it
So tell me about this dance Was it fun
No Daddy
I do n't understand the allure of dehydrated food Is this something I should be hip to
Funny
Yeah She left with some bikers Big ones Full of sperm
Was that your sister
I want to go to an East Coast school I want you to trust me to make my own choices I want
You 're eighteen You do n't know what you want You wo n't know until you 're forty-five and you do n't have it
So what I want does n't matter
As a parent that 's my right
Because you 're making decisions for me
Why ca n't we agree on this
I thought you were punishing me
Is this about Sarah Lawrence You punishing me
Then tell them I had a seizure
My insurance does not cover PMS
Enough
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips
You decided

PERKY No I believe heinous bitch is the term used most often
Tempestuous
PERKY The point is Kat people perceive you as somewhat
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls I was merely a spectator
PERKY Well yes compared to your other choices of expression this year today 's events are quite mild By the way Bobby Rictor 's gonad retrieval operation went quite well in case you 're interested
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
PERKY Katarina Stratford My my You 've been terrorizing Ms Blaise again

Patrick Pat you 're not looking at the big picture Joey 's just a pawn We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl
So Dorsey can get the girl
That 's where we can help you With Kat
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants I 'm just in this for the cash
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron 's love is pure Purer than say Joey Dorsey 's
What is it with this chick She have three tits
The situation is my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford
What plan
Whatever the hell it is you 're standin there waitin to say

Dr Ruth

Kissing Is that what you think happens Kissing is n't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day

Pirate no question
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral
You 're not helping
Tumescent
Jesus Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country
What 's a synonym for throbbing
Make anyone cry today
In the microwave
Ca n't be that far I say Also I do n't like the smell of the sea around here Smells like a cunt Bad sign
We left three weeks ago Alonso Ca n't be that near
We should have seen land
We 'll all go crazy
He 's the devil 's child
With a face like that I do n't want you looking at me You hear
Ah leave him alone He 's doing no harm
What are you listening to chicken ass
You 'll be drinking your own piss For the glory of Spain and Admiral Colon Bastard
The water 's going putrid in the barrels
I never seen heat like this Not even in Las Minas
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT
Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it
Blind faith is what I consider heresy
Do n't you realize your words could be considered heretical
Did He not choose a carpenter 's son to reveal Himself to the world
If God intended our proximity to Asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
No The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people I too will find other populations and bring them to the word of God
Is that all that interests you Gold
Trade Your Excellency According to Marco Polo the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold
If they agree to follow me yes
Your life and that of others
Your Eminence there is only one way to settle the matter And that is to make the journey I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible
Excellency you are right
Senor Colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment
Then you can not ignore that according to their calculations the circumference of the Earth is approximately 22,000 leagues or more Which makes the ocean uncrossable
I am Your Eminence
Unfortunately Don Colon that is precisely where our opinions differ Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle Erathostene Ptolemeus
Yes your Eminence The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
You say Asia can be found by sailing west
A waste Let me tell you something Arojaz If your name or mine is ever remembered it will only be because of his
What a tragedy what a waste of a life
You can see for yourself
On the contrary Your Eminence It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
It wo n't be easy to get rid of your prophet now Don Sanchez
Indeed The world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them when it benefits them My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain
He is a mercenary Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions
Naturally But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a dispute over a point of geography
The Judgment is ours
The State has some reason to be interested in this man 's proposition Your Eminence
I ca n't keep my eyes off you I would like to catch up with all the moments I did n't spend with you
What is it now Tell me
I am busy inside
Ca n't you stay with us a little
Not everything Do you think I care I 'm a free man again Riches do n't make a man rich they only make him busier
They took everything
They tried but I did n't let them
God you 're so beautiful I ca n't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service
You do n't usually ask
Beatrix I want to ask you something
That 's something you ca n't decide
I do n't want you to wait for me
I 'm not asking you to swear to anything
Thank God
She said yes
I find that hard to believe
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman
I 'd love to argue with you sometimes But you 're never here
Are we going to argue
Well that 's true I have a child by a man who wo n't marry me Who 's always leaving
I have n't given you much of a life
I know
I could be gone for years
I am afraid this is not the worst news
How could I be The mainland has been found Exactly as I said it would
I am not a seaman But I heard it is no more than a week at sea I hope you are not too disappointed
How far from here
Congratulations Then I am free to search for the mainland
Viceroy of the West Indies
Appointment to what
My letters of appointment
Yes I remember
Don Alonso de Bobadilla
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon
May I ask by whom
Forgive me Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands Is it not so
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
Really God I would n't know where to start and yet
I want you to tell me everything you remember Father From the beginning Everything
He never had one except aboard my ships
He asks when he can come to visit you He left his address
What does he say
I am not listening Father But I ca n't help hearing
What are you listening to
There must be a passage to that other ocean
Father
Not bad
How are you feeling Fernando
This time with me
I have to explore the mainland
Yes Yes I do On all of them
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven
You promise Do you swear on St Christopher
There 'll be a time
I want to go with you
All of them created by people like me
Roofs towers palaces spires
What do you see
Look out of that window
I am not afraid of you You are nothing but a dreamer
Call them
All I have to do is call the guards
To rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation A little hypocrisy goes a long way
What Do I have so many already
You seem to have a special talent for making friends
Good We are also in need of judges Except there are no thieves
Don Bobadilla is already a judge my Dear Don Cristobal
But we do have a lack of notaries You should contact my administration
for a commoner
You defend yourself admirably
Forgive me Don Colon But what about gold
They do n't see sin in their nakedness They live according to nature in a never ending summer The islands are covered with trees filled with blossoms and fruits And
If you wo n't accept our proposal we 'll simply find someone who will
And were you never ambitious Excellency Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us
Then you are too ambitious
I 'm not bargaining
I remind you Senor Colon that you are in no position to bargain with me
NO I have waited too long fought too hard Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit No I will not be your servant
No
No
You never learned how to speak my language
Utapan wo n't you speak to me You used to know how to speak to me
You did the same to your God
You have to find them Utapan Look what they did
Ask him if he will help
He understands
We will work with his people We want peace Ask the Chief if he understands
He has medicine Tell him we admire his people
Chief says
and also to bring medicine
Chief says he has a God
To bring the word of God
Why
Thousands
Chief says how many
Tell him his country is very beautiful Tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort
Chief knows
Tell the Chief we thank him
You come You speak first
Island Far
What is it A tribe An island
Say not here Cuba
I do n't know I have the impression that I did n't change that much I still ca n't accept the world as it is
Oh So you are a new man
New worlds create new people
I knew you would
I have to disagree
You 'll always be older than me Father
I suppose we 're both old men now
Give me absolution
I believed in you
You are bound by an oath Father
My son my son Your certitudes are sometimes frightening Christopher you must speak to them And if you do n't I will
If I tell them they wo n't follow me You know that I am right Father You trust me
May God forgive you You must tell them You must tell your men
I am not sure It could be twice the distance
How long
I lied The journey will be longer than I said
What are you saying
Father I have betrayed my family I betrayed my men And I betrayed you
I am listening my son
Forgive me Father For I have sinned
In Nomine Patris et Filius et Spiritus Sancti
Colon Do n't
All of them Just lies
Damn all of you You all set up theories based on what You never leave the safety of your studies Go out Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to
Colon
Damn God
If God intends you to go then you will go
Wait I 've waited seven years already How much longer do you want me to wait
You must n't give way to despair You must wait
Only God knows the meaning of such words my son
I 've been contradicted all my life Eternity
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted
Passion is something one can not control
Father Marchena
I 'll try to remember that Marchena
Two minutes and already you 're a dead man Do n't let passion overwhelm you Colon
So was Christ
Esdras is a Jew
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr Esdras
How can you be so certain
Ignorance I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands
How can you be so certain The Ocean is said to be infinite
To open a new route to Asia At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
Why do you wish to sail west
With some difficulty I had to promise them you were not a total fool
How did you manage it
That 's what it says
God That 's in a week
Father I am doing what I think is the best for him And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself
Diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious Brothers should be raised together Colon Even brothers from different mothers
Your Majesty some men are content to read about things I must see them with my own eyes I can not be other than I am
There is one thing I 'd like to understand Why do you want to go back after all this
Thank you
But without your brothers Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies You may explore the continent
They come and go as naked as the day God created them
Do they have such thoughts
Thirty seven Your Majesty And you
How old are you Senor Colon
A woman
I know what I see I see someone who does n't accept the world as it is Who 's not afraid I see a women who thinks What if
You show no inclination to speak otherwise
May I speak freely
Surely you can do anything you want
I can not ignore the verdict of my council
That she was impregnable
What did they say about Granada before today
The ocean is uncrossable
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors
I should not even be listening to you since my council said no But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity And Sanchez that you are not a fool
You will regret this
You 'll be held in detention deprived of your privileges and possessions Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged Have you anything to say
Savagery is what monkeys understand
In one act of brutality you have created chaos Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us All that because of your criminal savagery
You did not hear me Don Colon Not my horse
Don Moxica we all have to work
My horse does n't work
We ca n't raise the wheel without it
We came here to stay To build Not to start a crusade In this forest there is enough danger to sweep us away in days So we will be brave and swallow our grief And in the name of those who died we will accomplish what we came for
We do n't need to know
You want a war Fine We are a thousand They outnumber us by ten Who will you kill Which tribe
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders you 'll do as I say
We lost cousins friends We will wash this in blood
The Indians have no such word Don Moxica
And you say this is an Indian vice By God I do n't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin
We ca n't be
He 's drawing an isthmus He 's saying we 're on an isthmus
What 's he doing
Twenty eight
What do you read
Come over here
Well I surely know what a quadrant is But I 've never seen it used at night before
And what do you think Mendez
Well It 's the men Sir They wonder how you know our position We 've lost sight from land days ago
God be with us admiral
Due west Captain Mendez And may God be with us
You 're right Let the men decide
You tell that to them
Pinzon Pinzon All we can do now is go forward Think about that
You bloody
You never did You did all the talking for both of us remember
Jesus Maria I should have never listened to you
And then what Half of the water has gone the rest is nearly putrid You know that
You do n't know anything Listen Colon these are my ships right So I 'm telling you we 're turning back
The land is there I know it
We 're lost
You think I do n't know that
We 're on the verge of a mutiny Colon
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive
You must be mad
Six days ago yes
You lied You cheated We 're way past 750 leagues
Immediately
Where can I meet this man
Because he is not afraid of me
Then why
I know I should not tolerate his impertinence
And who would you think of for such a task
He must be replaced
Then what do you suggest Don Sanchez
Is this true Brother Buyl
But there is worse He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
We were n't expecting immediate profits were we We must have faith We must give time for time
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying But with no gold The new world proves expensive Your Majesty
Yes It would be a pity would n't it Call him back
Into a monk
Never Your Majesty Although
You were right Don Sanchez His demands could never be granted
Yes Your Majesty
Is that the man I knew Treasurer Sanchez
Officers there 's your killer do your duty arrest him
so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital
I do n't think it 's abuse I think it 's torture
I 'm abused Do n't you think
Can I see your back
Out on my back when I was a small boy
Your father put cigarettes out on you
That 's what he did to me He put cigarettes out on me
Yeah he hated me from day when I was born Put it out Can you put the cigarette out
Your father blamed you for your mother 's blindness
Yeah yeah bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind And my father blamed me for her blindness
Back in the Czech Republic
Yeah she went blind giving birth to me She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me
Your mother was blind
My father always degraded me Killed my self-esteem And my mother was blind
Tell me about yourself What you did as a young boy what your parents were like
Give me another one please
I need to know about your background I need to know about your upbringing Why you 're here
What else do you need
This is not about money Emil I need your trust in me

Pouring it out
What are you doing
I 'll get my clothes
I 'll make some for us
In the kitchen
Do you have coffee
Right
You better get packed
I 'm glad I met you
No matter what happens I 'm glad I met you
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process Eddie recommended one
If you were my boyfriend I 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail ten-thousand miles away
If I was your boyfriend I might be
Ludwig He 's gay are you jealous
Is he your boyfriend
I 'm sorry
I still ca n't believe Eddie 's gone
Are you alright
I 'm sorry I did n't mean to I 'm glad Actually I 'm glad it 's over All this time Hiding Never being able to look anyone in the eyes Always afraid that someone would find out who I was Never trusting anyone
They 're not gon na send you right back
You do n't know I 'm sorry I was desperate That 's not me I shot a cop Can you imagine what they 'll do to me when I got to prison
I know
I 'm not a whore I 'm not a whore
I 'm just trying to find out who you are
What are you asking me
So you were never a prostitute
I came here I had no money I knew no one I could n't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work They approached me I could 've made a lot of money I considered it but it 's not who I am They pay me below the table at Ludwig 's
No
What about back home
No
Did you ever turn tricks before
Yes I considered it
You considered becoming a prostitute
Yeah This way
So the station is empty
The men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires
Somewhere else
I ca n't take you to my place
Do you live alone I 've been in these clothes since the killings Could we stop at your place I could take a shower before I go into custody
Divorced
Are you married
They wo n't until this is over
I will if they do n't send me back
If you cooperate with the DA maybe they 'll help you with your situation
Now I become custody of police department
Yes but he was a cop
Alright That 's a justifiable homicide
my little sister and I shared a flat I came home one night and a man was raping her His gun was on the chair He came at me and I shot him
You 're a cop you 'll never believe me
Look we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here Tell us the truth is that the truth
I 'm from a small town in Slovakia Like the South here The Police is right a civilian is wrong So I fled
A cop
No no do n't talk to Immigration
Are you here illegally Do n't worry about that We 'll talk to Immigration They wo n't deport you
Arrest you for what Why would we arrest you

Whether you tell us or not we 'll find out Better if it comes from you
Go on

It was my decision not his
Oh
There 's nothing to talk about Get a good lawyer You 're suspended until your trial
But Chief Over this
How are you going to fight this Maybe if Oleg had n't gotten away and you 'd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight You 'd have the good to weight against the bad It 's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there 's nothing I can do Gim me your shield
End my career
Well this is gon na end your career and probably mine
Chief I know I screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian
Forgot You handcuffed a civilian to a tree
What was I supposed to do The guy tried to mug me I was gon na send a cop back I just forgot
The public does n't have any idea what we do and now you 're going to define our image This is going to be our Rodney King
Okay But not water sports
Chief mind if I take her

No Nothing happened
A shower Did you take one too

I came to see how the investigation was going I called and you 're not here I wait up at the station and you do n't even show up I beep you you do n't return my call Where the hell have you been

Tall short-haired scary eyes Second guy with him was shorter with a wrestler 's build And he would n't turn his videocamera off me
Describe him
He said he was her cousin I told him where she works They were just here
Daphne Another guy came in asking me about her too
What are you saying
Boy she 's so popular all the sudden
Did you tell him you did
No
Do you have any Czech girls working for you
Yeah He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there you know it does n't really matter Honey was killed Poor girl
Oh my G-d Honey Honey 's dead
We do n't have her I.D yet but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel
What 's wrong
Homicide Miss Hearn It 's Detective Eddie Flemming Open up
I have nothin to say If you wan na contact my attorney
Police We 'd like to ask you a few questions
Who 's there
You know I do n't know I like you You remind me of a puppy I used to have He pissed on the rug all the time but I still kept him
Why 'd you help me back there with the Chief Why 'd you stand up for me like that
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer Here here 's a number of an Immigration lawyer That 's how you help her But you ca n't get involved in her like that You 're gon na jeopardize your career your life and you 're gon na jeopardize my case And lem me give you another piece of advice Maybe you do n't watch TV but I 'll let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin world watches television And when you get out there they know your face And the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job And I get more done because of it
But I mean did n't you ever go out on a limb for somebody I mean you shoulda heard her there Tellin her whole story I believed her
Well it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not Do n't you understand that 's why you 're a professional
I told you you know I thought I was doing the right thing you know I think she 's innocent
No I do n't think you were a fool I just think you were stupid about it I mean to say the least you outta know better You do n't know her well enough She 's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her it 's fuckin over You can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference You 're dead
Yeah just her in the shower Nothing happened Look I 'm sure you probably think I 'm a fool and I fucked up but
Just a shower
I took her there for a shower and that 's it
Well you shoulda because nobody 's gon na believe you did n't including me
Look Eddie I 'm tellin you I did n't touch her
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs
Hey I 'm a professional
Okay tell you what I 'll give you a head start You take her to the station house Do n't let her out of your sight She 's the only warm body we got left
You know what I 'm saying here
You 're her Savior Is she the kid you 're gon na save from the burning building
C'mon You intimidate her 'cause you 're a celebrity She sees me differently
So am I
I 'm serious here
My point exactly
I do n't have a girlfriend
What would your girlfriend think of that
Yeah
You wan na talk to her alone
Look let me talk to her Any leads I get they 're all yours Just let me have a first crack at her
Raw deal
She 's fucked Even if that story is true
Something back home
Why not
Is that all there is
She just saw two of her friends killed They probably threatened her
What are you hiding Why are you afraid
Then I guess we 're doin this the right way are n't we If we pull up to a burning building I 'll gladly let you go first
I wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid
Hey I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid I dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze at the bad guy What 'd you dream about
Of course
So am I Alright I 'll go inside and you cover the back
I 'm on duty
You thirsty
I 'm on my way with Eddie Ludwig 's 63rd and Madison The suspects might be there already
Leon meet us at 63rd and Madison Hair salon Ludwig 's
Better than one
Two heads
I 'll call it tails
Tell you what I 'll flip you a coin If you win you can come with me If you do n't win you do n't come
This is ridiculous I 'm not gon na be in your way we can talk the case over
I 'll let you know what happens
But what if it does You might need my help
This has nothing to do with your fire
Mind if I ride along with you
You got any better ideas
You goin to the escort service
Stay here
My folks are
You 're Polish
My parents are from Poland I can help with the Eastern European angle
This is n't homicide school
I can watch you Eddie Maybe I 'll learn something
There was n't a fire There 'll be nothing for you to do
I 'll come with you
Or Czechoslovakia The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years These are very intense people and they take things personally
Eastern Europe Like what Romania Hungary
Maybe it 's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe It could be to humiliate them Just burning them up no proper funeral it 's like condemning them to hell
Look I 'm not even sure she has anything to do with this I saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead Maybe she saw something Maybe she was visiting somebody here Who knows
What would you call her
Who says she 's a suspect
Maybe you do n't care about that either Prettiest suspect I 've had in awhile
Hmmmm
Pretty
The Super said he 'd seen her before but she did n't live here
You were right they were both dead before the fire The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine That 's usually an indicator of something personal
If you found me steppin on your crime scene it might piss you off too What about the report
Sure But I would like to ask you something You got a problem with me
Did you get a report from the M.E
Good Good Commendable
I do n't even watch TV
Nah why should you
Well just so you know I do n't care about that stuff
Well just so you know I gave you guys the credit
Nah I musta missed it
Watch the news

Smarter than Americans You 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long Not only will Americans believe me they 'll cry for me So Detective Eddie Flemming would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette Maybe you can propose to her now
You really think you 'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit How fuckin stupid are you
If you kill me and film it you 're putting a noose around your neck

There was a woman I think she wanted to talk to us She looked scared Oh shit Oh no

He knew all along
You see Eddie 's face when I gave him the timer Wish I had a picture of it

The smoke 'll permeate your nostrils burn 'em out Let it run

What are you gon na do
The clerk
Capra That 's not Czech or Russian Who said he sounded Russian
Room was registered to a Francis Capra
GELLER That does n't apply to me because I 'm not a criminal I 'm not a criminal I was n't convicted
HAWKINS But does n't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
GELLER We 're in negotiations that 's correct
HAWKINS And is n't there a movie in the works about you
GELLER Look I 'm in here You call this a career move
HAWKINS Permanently disrupted Are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money Has n't this 'incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist
GELLER Look I 'm a victim here too I was a year away from getting my masters in Art now I 'll never graduate My life has been permanently disrupted
HAWKINS You seem very savvy for a man who 's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
GELLER It was my finger that pulled the trigger but I 'm not morally responsible My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of How could I know I 'm not a doctor
HAWKINS so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
GELLER Yes My psychiatrist did n't insist that I stay on my medication
HAWKINS Your doctor
GELLER This had nothing to do with shoes that did n't fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor
We 're trying to get there I hope we can
CONTINUED
I 'm sorry Dr Smyslov but I 'm really not at liberty to discuss this
CONTINUED
How did they manage to do that without any communication
CONTINUED
Well I suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
CONTINUED
She 's wonderful
CONTINUED
I 'm afraid I 've only got a few minutes but I 'd love to
CONTINUED
Well how nice to see you again Elena You 're looking wonderful
SPACE STATTION 5 LOUNGE
Roger
I think I 'll have to go out and burn them off
I guess not
I guess you do n't know your own strength old boy
I did n't do that Frank I took particular care not to freeze them
Well now that we 've got one that 's actually failed we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it
It 's the last one
Yes
Hal
Well I hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those Other wise we 're out of business
Two more
Two units in four days How many spares do we have
I do n't know Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
No
You 're kidding
Well Hal 's reported the AO-unit about to fail again
Oh I 'm fine I 'm wide awake What 's up
Are you reasonably awake
Good morning How 's it going
Anyway it 's just as well that we replace it Better safe than sorry
Yes but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong
Yes I do n't know what to make of it
Well that 's something
Still all we have to do is ask Hal
I guess it is n't
I suppose it is n't logically impossible
But not completely inconceivable
I know It would be almost inconceivable
Yes but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us
Not really Though it is strange when you think about it It did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training
That 's true
Just ask Hal It 's conceivable they might keep something from us but they 'd never keep anything from Hal
How
Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
Yes I thought so
That seems very unlikely
I do n't know All I heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told
Oh well apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we do n't know and that 's why we were trained separately and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
No as a matter of fact I did n't
Yes You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out
Oh
I suppose so Though of course there 's a more sinister explanation
I suppose the idea was specialized training
No I never did either
I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
I do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet I 'm sure they 'll straighten it out
Well what do you think we ought to do about it
It 's possible
Not really They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall and that we 're being charged against differ ent accounting offices
Yesterday I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
Yes
Really
Interesting that you mention it because I 've got the same problem
That 's right Well naturally I did n't say anything to Payroll I assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque But it 's been almost three weeks now and I 'm still being paid as an AGS-18
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left
Yes
It 's about my salary cheques
What 's up
Well it 's nothing really important but it 's annoying
Sure what is it
Dave if you 've a minute I 'd like your advice on something
Okay come on down
Okay
Right Just a sec
Hi Frank coming in please
Listen to me very carefully Hal Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
I know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now Dave but it would be a crying shame since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and I have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
I am prepared to do that anyway
Hal unless you follow my instructions I shall be forced to disconnect you
I 'm sorry Dave but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4 quote When the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote I must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
Hal I 'm in command of this ship I order you to release the manual hibernation control
I can tell from the tone of your voice Dave that you 're upset Why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest
I do n't like to assert myself Dave but it would be much better now for you to rest You 've been involved in a very stressful situation
Hal switch to manual hibernation control
Look Dave your 've probably got a lot to do I suggest you leave it to me
I 'm goin to do this myself Hal Let me have the control please
If you 're determined to revive the crew now I can handle the whole thing myself There 's no need for you to trouble
I do n't really agree with you Dave My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
It does n't have to be Hal It 's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth Let me have manual control please
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
The antenna has to be replaced
I suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be revived for another three months
I suppose you 're pretty broken up about it
Yes it is
Too bad about Frank is n't it
Well that 's a relief You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
Yes it is Hal
Is your confidence in me fully restored
And do n't you worry about it
Well do n't worry about it
I 'm sorry about the misunderstanding Hal
Naturally Dave I 'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability I certainly would n't want to be disconnected even temporarily as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history
Okay Hal well let 's see the way things go from here on
Look Dave I know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job and that you 're trying to be helpful but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units and with your test gear
Hal is there anything bothering you Anything that might account for this problem
I 'm not questioning your word Dave but it 's just not possible I 'm not capable of being wrong
Yes I know that But I can assure you that they were about to fail
You probably also know that we found them okay
Yes I know
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition
Sure Dave what 's up
Not now Hal I 'd like to talk to you about something
I understand Hal We 'll take care of it Please let me have the hard copy
The unit is still operational Dave but it will fail within seventy-two hours
MY F.P.C shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
What is it Hal
Sorry to interrupt the festivities Dave but I think we 've got a problem
He 's got a point
I 'm sorry Frank but I do n't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know
Well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
CONTINUED
Still you really do n't believe it do you
CONTINUED
Well it 's silly but if you want to why do n't you
CONINUED
Well what is it
CONTINUED
Did they have any explanation for this
CONTINUED
Yes I remember you mentioning it I got mine about the same time
CONTINUED
Goodbye Daddy
'Bye 'bye now sweetheart
Yes Daddy
I 'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I 'll see you soon All right Darling
Thank you Daddy
Okay sweetheart Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow
Three darling One two three Be sure to tell Mommy I called
How many days until you come home
Okay sweetheart Well I have to go now Tell Mommy that I called
She 's in the bathroom
Where is Mrs Brown
Mommy 's out to the hair dresser
One two three Can I speak to Mommy
In three days darling I hope
When are you coming home
No I 'm sorry darling I told you I wo n't be home for a few days
Are you coming to my party
Yes I know that sweetheart
I 'm having a party tomorrow
I 'm fine Daddy When are you coming home
I 'm at Space Station Five darling How are you
I 'll bet it 's a fortune
I was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
Yes well whatever it is they 're certainly not fooling around This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
Well I 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
Well how 's it going back there
Thank you
Oh thank you very much
Thank you It 's been a great pleasure to meet all of you Dr Smyslov
Well Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you
Well I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C conference in June
No thank you and I 'm afraid now I really must be going
Are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink
Well that does sound very odd
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
Well where are all of you off to
He 's fine But I 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days
How is gregor
Oh that 's such a delightful age
Oh she 's growing up very fast As a matter of fact she 's six tomorrow
And your charming little daughter
Yes it 's coming along very well
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
Yes I think so Just about then
Fine
Well shall we go through Documentation
Yes very pleasant
Well Did you have a pleaant flight
Please it really does n't matter
Well thank you very much for being so understanding
I 'm terribly sorry I was just on my way down to meet you I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time and I was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
How do you do Mr Miller
Dr Smyslov I 'm not permitted to discuss this
This epidemic could easily spread to our base Dr Floyd We should be given all the facts
Quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius Something apperently of an unknown origin Is this in fact what has happened
Certainly
Dr Floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may I ask you a straightforward question
Well I 'm glad about that
Fortunately they did
Yes Well I hope the crew got back safely
Yes and I 'm afaid there 's going to be a bit of a row about it Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S convention
I see
That 's right
You mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
Yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but it 's been going on for the past ten days
Yes Well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
Really
Well it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius
I 'm sorry but I 'm not sure I know what you mean
Yes as a matter of fact I am
Are you by any chance going up to your base at Clavius
Well as it happens I 'm on my way up to the moon
Yes really thank you very much
Are you quite sure
Oh I really do n't have time for a drink If it 's all right I 'll just sit for a minute and then I 've got to be off
I do n't think it has but I 'd like to check that Simpson what 's the log on that
Has it been exposed to any sun before now
Well not really At first glance black would suggest something sun-powered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
Any ideas about the colour
Tomb shine survey-marker spare part take your choice
But you do n't have any idea as to what it is
Not really It 's completely inert No sound or energy sources have been detected The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it A laser drill
Any clue as to what it is
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
How can you tell it was deliberately buried
Yes it does The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
I 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
Dr Floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
Well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable
No of course Captain I can understand your concern
Well fine Thanks very much anyway and I hope you do n't mind me asking
Yes well I would n't have been too concerned about it except I 've heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact I 've heard that ten people have died already
I see Well I 'm sorry about that I would n't think there 's any cause for alarm
Well I 'll tell you why I ask You see I 've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears I 'm a little concerned about her
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at Clavius
I see
Well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty-four hours And then we 're going to back empty
What do you mean
Incidentally Dr Floyd I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements
Thank you

What are you talking about We did n't kill her
You lying son of a bitch
No trouble Jack But listen suppose I stay a crook Where 'd you get the idea that you could catch me
Thanks
Spare met Jack I 'm into legit investments from here on in
No you do n't If I ever get word of you steppin over the line again I 'm gon na ventilate that suit of yours
You are an awesomely weird cop Sure wish there were more like you runnin around out here
That 's right Not my style Reggie
And you 're tellin me you do n't want any of this cash
It 's your money It 'll be here in six months when you get out
There 's nothin to talk about
Wait a minute Cates I 've been waitin three years for that I do n't think it 's fair man What about the merit system You were gonnna give me a few thousand
Hey Jack real men do n't have to go in for that macho bullshit but I was fantastic
Okay reggie start bustin my chops Tell me how great you were with that chick
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own
Yeah But I was n't there for a second
You okay
Well you got to admit we come a long way
Partnership
Yeah and I know Ganz sure ai n't no sweetheart I would n't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started
Sure I 'll give you a shot at it but Ganz is mine You know that big Indian plays it for keeps
If we run into Billy first let me try and talk him in
Whatever play I maker just back me up
Hey there she is
I 've got to play it rough with them If they know anything I 'm gon na know it
What if your girl 's theory turns out to be bullshit I mean they could be in Rio de Janeiro
If she 's right and if you do n't screw up
Do I get to kiss her too
Yeah too bad They were real nice lookin too In bed together hardly any clothes one watching TV
Yeah well the only woman of the Indian 's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet They both looked mad enough to kill him
Do n't worry about it
It 's late they 're closing
Yeah but we did n't get 'em
Naw you did n't let me down It was a long shot all the way We gave 'em a good run at it
Sorry we did n't do better Jack I feel like I let you down
I do n't know about you but I could use a drink I 'll buy you one It 'll be my good-bye present
Back to jail in my own car Ganz got away Got all my money It just do n't seem right
I had it impounded Come on we 'll use it for haulin you back to the slam
Hey how 'd my car get here
Yeah It missed the last four stops
Notice something funny about that bus
Luther 's on the move
Why
When you been in prison three years it do n't take long Let 's go
That was quick
I can just take her right across the street to Luther 's hotel All I need is some money for the room
Yeah I see her
Yeah Guess not
Bein good at your job do n't explain everything Jack
Thanks for callin in and I guess Maybe Look I 'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger those kinds of things I was just leanin on ya doin my job
You sure that 's the reason
I do n't know why but I 'm going to let you keep it Maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because I 'm too tired to argue
Forget it I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you
Tell me something Why did n't you just take the money off Luther and split
So you took the rest of the night off
They must have set up a meeting for the morning Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the Do n't Disturb sign He 's trading his girl for the money All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind
Let him get some sleep He 's going to need it
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit
You missed Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street Made a phone call
We missed
What about Ganz
What about Luther
Hello And goodbye
Be polite Say hello This is Candy
Where 's luther
I 'll be there in a minute You do n't move your ass right
Hey Jack how ya doin What took you so long to call man I been waitin I 'm at Vroman 's up in the Fillmore Yeah Vroman 's 'Course you do n't hang out here it 's for the brothers
No way
You stay with me
Bullshit Then i 'm staying with the money
Right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then you 're all set
That was in style a couple years back man
Yeah most cops are pretty dumb But since you 're the one that landed in jail what 's that make you
We 're getting too close Cates what 's the matter you been takin dumb pills
Class is n't somethin you buy punk Look at you five hundred dollar suit and you 're still a lowlife
No class
What you do n't understand is I do n't give a damn about how this thing looks
You know I 'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you 've done with this job
Yeah it does n't look like he 's gon na make it as a dangerous tough guy
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
If he 's hoping that then he 's dumber than I think he is which would be amazin cause I already think he 's real dumb
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz 'll give him a piece of your money
You got a very depressing view of life man you got ta smile once in awhile
I 'm not in this 'cause it 's fun I 'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either I do it 'cause it works
Does n't it get Tiring
If they do n't tell me what I need to know
Say do you always work people over like you did Luther
That ai n't philosophy That 's common sense
I let women get to me The quest for pussy is the meaning of life I got my own personal philosophy about 'em Keep women separate from guns money and business women are for spending money They got nothing to do with helping you make it
I suppose you 'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you
Oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid
I 'm tellin you the man 's in love he wants to be a hero for his girl
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass I 'd just leave town
Tryin to save his girl man He 's in another world
You 'd think the guy 'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed
I had no choice Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac
Did n't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
Jesus Christ look at all the dust on my car why in the hell do n't he take it to a car wash
Jesus Christ That 's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he 's out in 24 hours I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door
Musta got some primo bondsman
What
Guess what Luther just got in line
Not really I figured Ganz was put down for a long time And I knew Luther would never job me on his own He 's too chickenshit
You took a big chance leaving this here all this time
Shit
I was n't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice Jack
You son of a bitch You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing
You just drove by it
For three years Let 's hope it was n't a tow-away zone
This 'll show you how smart I am I got it parked
You 're a real case you know that Jack
Where 's the goddamn car
Yeah Right
Get this We ai n't partners We ai n't brothers We ai n't friends If Ganz gets away with my money you 're gon na be sorry we ever met
Right partner
In the trunk of a car A lot better than under a mattress right
Where 's the money
Depends on how things work out I believe in the merit system So far you have n't built up any points
You gon na let me keep any of it
Not likely convict
We split 50-50
You catch on real fast Okay Jack let 's talk deal How much of my money you gon na let me keep
He 's after your money
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale It 's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen I was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job Some psycho who 's out there capping people with some cop 's gun
Just tell me about the money
Jesus
Half a million
How much
I been waiting a long time for some money
One thing 's for sure Jack That 's how you 'll tell the story
They saved your ass convict
Naw you 'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
Yeah right You want to try again
Who gives a Goddamn what you think You 're just a crook that 's got a weekendpass You 're not even a name anymore Just a spear chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
Maybe I do n't like the way you ask
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock 's runnin
I 'm impressed with you too Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night
You Do n't make me laugh You ca n't take care of shit You 've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt All you 're good for is games So far what I got outta you is nothin
You wan na leave man Let me take care of Ganz all by myself
This sucks A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it So instead of me being where I oughta be which is in bed giving my girl the high hard one I 'm out here doing this shit roaming around with some overdressed charcoal-colored loser like you
Wait a minute Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us How about it I been nearly three years in prison and
Let 's go
Come on
Must be billy 's girl
There
While you 're at it You can give me the switchblade too
You made that move huh
Some of us citizens are with you all the way Officer
That was n't necessary buddy I got this under control
My kind of place I always liked country boys
This place do n't seem real popular with the brothers
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes
I 'm gon na enjoy this here I 'll even loan you my badge
The bet 's off
I do n't know what you 're talking about I just wan na see Ganz nailed
You tell me what Ganz busted out for he 's after a lot more than just gettin out of jail And whatever it is you 're part of it
What are you talkin about
I 'll tell you what happens if you lose you tell the truth for once
That 's never been one of my problems
Why Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably ca n't get it up anyway
If we come outta this joint with Ganz phone number or a dead Indian or anything else useful then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid
I got two problems Number one I 'm not playin games Number two you got nothin to bet with
Hey you wan na bet
You need five years training to handle a joint like
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge
Bullshit Attitude and experience get you through
But you can handle it all right huh Real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
If they kick my ass they 'll sure as hell carve yours up
Back you up Now why would I wan na do that
This part of town they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in Just back me up like you 've got a piece
It 's a long shot but Billy used to tend bar here a few years back I heard him talk about it
Well
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you Tell me a little about her She got great tits
Sure Then we had a fight this morning
You have a good time
Last night
Last night two nights ago three
I do n't give out the details
Mission District Gon na find us an Indian
Now where we goin convict
She 's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population She ca n't get the job she 's trained for and it pisses her off Anyway what the fuck do you care
You really do have onoe huh Jack what 's her problem besides you
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut
Who 'd you call on the phone back at the booking station
Yeah I want mandolins flowers They move off down the corridor
Yeah I 'm hungry too I know of a place Let 's go eat
Bullshit I ai n't moving till I get something to eat You 've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here If you do n't like it you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye And I want some food some place nice Some good people nice music
We eat when I say we eat
Speakin of moans my Stomach is startin to growl
Yeah well my ass bleeds for you And I did n't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn trim hunt stop moaning
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim And you fucked it up
We 're on the move Let 's go As they walk toward a corridor
If you let him run around till Tuesday he 's gon na run right to Ganz and warn him Ai n't you motherfucker
He 's got ta take that call if there is one
I think you better put him on ice man
What do you think
Want to try it again
Thank you
Hey this works pretty good
Just throw me the Goddamn gun
I got a whole thing about people pointin guns at me
I 'm tellin you to drop the Goddam gun
Quit playin cop and undo this cuff Jack I need to talk to this man
I 'm helpin you huh
Luther ai n't the reliable type I do n't want you shot yet Cates not before you been a help to me
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me
Just up the street the other side over there Now do n't bother knockin on the door Luther ai n't the kind of guy that looks for company
I may call you worse than that
Then what 're you complainin about At least nobody 's calling you shithead
I do n't give a damn It happens to be my name
Just an expression man do n't mean nothin
I can read a police file shithead and quit calling me Jack
What gang you talkin about Jack
Luther was part of the gang
Do n't worry I got a move for ya An awesome move A guy named Luther Ganz 'll be paying him a visit We go to him right away
Okay let 's get down to it I did my part and got you out So now you tell me where we 're goin
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers
Yeah
Shit I 'm already sorry
Get this We ai n't partners We ai n't brothers We ai n't friends I 'm puttin you down and keepin you down until Ganz is locked up or dead And if Ganz gets away you 're gon na be sorry we ever met
No way to start a partnership
You just do n't get it do your Reggie There is n't any deal I own your ass
Hey no way Take off the bracelets or no deal
You got a girl shit the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
I do n't need to hear your jive I already got that department taken care of
Listen it may be a little out of date You know I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies
We 're supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers
What are you talkin about This suit 's mine It cost 900
This prison gives out 400 suits
I 'll think about it
It 's the only way you 're gon na get Ganz
Bullshit
I got a lot to protect
What 's the big deal about you bein on the street
I can help you man but you got ta get me out I got to be on the street Get me outta here
You 're crazy
I can deliver Ganz But you got ta get me outta here first
Yeah
Did n't work out that way He busted out with a big Indian They capped two guards on a road gang Nice meeting you Reggie
Ganz is in jail He 's gon na be there two years after I 'm on the street
Yeah I noticed
Not likely Reggie Maybe I just need some help
You here to write my life story
Sure anything you want
Try Cates And let 's talk in private okay
You got a name cop
I 'm taking my prisoner back to jail
Where the Christ do you think you 're going
Just cause you say it with conviction do n't mean shit to me How you gon na take to a pink slip huh
He 's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I 've worked with
Too bad it would 've covered your ass Now you 're in the shit and so 's the department In case you have n't noticed this was n't our finest hour I told you everyone was watchin on this one Maybe you better start thinkin about writin tickets off a three wheel bike
I did n't have the time
Do n't duck the bullet Cates Why did n't you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play
Right I screwed up I fucked up I messed up Anybody could have done better especially you I bet you 're real good at hitting targets through crowds
What a screw-up
You could n't get to him
The Indian I was about 30 yards away
Which one pulled the trigger
They ran As fast as they could Caught a train
How did they get away
I lost them that 's what happened
What the bell happened
I 'll keep it in mind
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces We got enough dead cops on this one
Yeah
Jack
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude He starts to go
Okay You 're not a team player You got ta do things your own way Fine Nail this guy and make us all look good But you better watch your ass If you screw up I can promise you you 're goin down
Being a hot dog 's worked pretty well for me so far Besides I got a lead
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one Jack
Yeah It bothers me when cops get hurt while I 'm makin a play I do n't like it
Anthing botherin you besides losin your gun
Yeah
Jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian In other words we ca n't seen like we 're in the revenge business I know we all know the truth 's a little different
Hey the bastard 's got my gun I want it back
Yeah I read the report
I want to be left alone on this one Algren was killed with my gun
COP I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible
Are you gon na tell me about police procedure Do me a favor do n't give me a bunch of crap
COP Somebody steals your gun you 're supposed to file a report
The truth hurts does n't it buddy
COP But that 's what you say about all of us all the tine we 're always the ones fucking up when you tell it
Yeah
COP That 's what you say Cates
I 'm not paid to take your personal calls He was in some bar off duty
Jesus Christ Why the hell did n't you tell me before
What
I almost forgot That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him
Okay See you in the morning you know you ought to get some rest
I got to wait for a call
I 'm heading out How about you
Bullshit red tape
Nothing
Nothing came in for me yet No calls
Does n't look like it
Aw bullshit you heard wrong
Long night too from what I heard Word 's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman some jig beat the crap out of you
So do you been a long day
You look awful
One of em 's in the slam
Here 's the file Cates checks the file
I think I wan na have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking Can we find them
Hey Dick Tracy
Tell me that 's not the same guy
Uhh Wong Henry Wong He was in on the same job
Wait a minute wait a minute who 's this
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago
Who are all these
Backup man from the East Bay Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang
Billy Bear
Shit
This guy must have had a 44 like yours Jack Now he 's got yours
I 'll help you out
Every last bit of it The big guy 's room was empty
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel
I dunno he 's gon na call me
When How
He he wants me to help him skip town
I do n't know
I think I met her Now tell us something we do n't know like where they stashed her
Ganz and Billy got my girl Rosalie
Who gives a fuck what you think
You just took a shot at me asshole I think you do know where he is
Have n't seen him for years That 's the truth
I sure ai n't his fairy godmother now I 'm looking for Ganz where is he
A cop
That 's what I always say
You 're impossible
He 's takin care of the same business I 'll be takin care of soon as I dry off
Tell me
Promised I 'd turn my back while he ah never mind
Where is he
Three more hours
Yeah bein a hard-ass all the time is a real drag but it works
I 've been waiting a long time to hear you say that
Usual bullshit You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend You know somethin shootin guys sucks Especially compared to this
How 'd they take it back at headquarters
Let 's go Reggie
What do I know I 'm just a bartender
Whaddya think
Oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out
Hey Come on shrink time 's over They would n't go see some old girlfriend
When a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible
So what
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week Jack and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian Now if this Indian 's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be she 's still vulnerable to him
Come on they were a little old for a slumber party
What makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes
Jack it 's all over the papers He 's an obvious type But this Indian
How do you know
Ganz is going to be hard to track Just a pure schizo wires all crossed totally without any pattern kill anybody The Indian himself anybody
Nothing No sign of Ganz No sign of the Indian Airport 's clean Train station Bus station Docks Shit
I 've been better Dead end No Ganz no Indian
You real down
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours
I can see that Pardon me for saying so but you look like shit What happened
Do n't We 've had a hard night
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out
Hiya kid
Hey I do n't believe it
Fuck you
Hi it 's me
Hello
Just a second that 's all
Jack wait
Elaine I got ta put you on hold
Jack What was that
The number what 's the Goddamn number
So am I
No it 's I 'm just surprised you called
No wonder you 're so popular
Elaine I I 'm sorry I was expecting somebody else police business
I 'm at work asshole Where else
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave
Listen Goddamn it if you think I 'm happy about it you 're nuts I just got ta take care of a few things okay
Elaine look I 'm in the middle of sone stuff right now I 'm not gon na have time to come by I do n't know when I can get there
Just one Some lady called Said she 's a little hot-headed sometimes But she still wants her occasional roommate She 'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight if it 's humanly possible
I get that The job first Everything else especially me second I get it I do n't like it
That 's right I 'm not like you I 'm not gon na sit on my ass wondering what 's right and what 's wrong There 's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I 'm gon na get him Because it 's my job And if you do n't get that
Here it comes again the sacred job
I did n't get burned two cops did Listen I 'll tell you about personnel responsibility I like to get the job done right And if I do n't get my job done right I 'm for shit
Look Jack if you make everything your personal responsibility you 'll turn into a bad cop It 's not a practical way to function
Bullshit I 'll tell you about bullshit My gun 's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it It is n't my macho bullshit that 's killing people my gun is
Look spare me the macho bullshit about your gun
Sure okay fine no problem See there 's this kid in jail First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows
Jack are you okay
Yeah Guess it must have been a slow news day
You made the front page
Yeah one of my favorites
Great place for lunch
Guess people ought to know who I am
I think you forgot this Hands him his wallet and badge
Thanks for the coffee
Yeah for some reason I 'm sure
You sure you want me to
Call me later
That 's the way I see it too
You know something Jack you really are hopeless
I wish you 'd stop trying to make me mad so I wo n't care for you I wish you 'd give me a little more of a chance
What do you want to know What difference does it make I 'm the guy in your bed the last three months I make you feel good You make me feel good What the hell else do you want from a guy
When you start with that attitude it 's like I do n't know who you are
Maybe you do n't know what the hell you 're talking about
Maybe that makes a nice excuse
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead
That 's a fairly crummy way to start a morning
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back
Maybe you ought to buy me one
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place
You know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning
I think you 're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear You pull down four bills a week which is damn good and you mix the best Pina Coladas I 've ever had I think that if you need bigger and better things then go for em
Tell me I 'm dyin to hear it
Hey you know what I really think
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems I 'll take brutal indifference
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit But just because I think it 's bullshit does n't mean I do n't know something about it
Are n't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit
Positive self-image problem all over again You are who you decide you are unless you 're the type that lets assholes decide for you
Then I sit back and I think I mean who 's to say I 'm not a dumb bitch I work in a bar right I ca n't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place You are what you do
I guess he got the message
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I 'd just poured him Then I tried to deck the sucker
What 'd you do
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today
What 's wrong with that
I 'm all wet
That 's the way I see it too
You 're hopeless
Hey you 're right
I still do n't think it 's loaded
This is a 44 Magnum the most powerful handgun in the world You got ta ask yourself just one question Are you feelin lucky
I do n't think your gun 's loaded
I do n't answer questions I ask 'em
What am I wanted for
In all due respect he sounds kind of pathetic to me The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend Have you two ace detectives checked that out
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend He was loyal went all the way for you
That 's no bull
Hey two days with him is enough
How would you know
Hard man to live with
Shrink major not a shrink
Well I been workin the other side of the street for the last few years And you do n't exactly look like a shrink wearin that dress

Akta dedero ansila do mektet

Vano da mechteba Soun domo kala chon hammas
You know exactly where they are
Ikset-kiba Me imanetaba oum dalat
The case was stolen
San Agamat chay bet envolet
The case..with the stones Where is it
Napoleon small
What 're you laughing about
At your service
Corn-i-Lius
Appipulai Leeloo Minai
I know
You are a monster Zorg
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
Father by creating a little destruction I am in fact encouraging life So in reality you and I are in the same business
They are robots
Look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden Notice how each one is useful What a lovely ballet so full of form and color So full of..life
Follow me Life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction Look at this empty glass
No thank you
would you like a drink
Ah Father You are so wrong Let me explain
I 'm a priest I 'm here to serve life All you want to do is destroy it
Why What 's wrong with me
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you
Personally they are of no interest to me I 'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer so tell me
Why on earth do the stones interest you
I 'm glad you got your memory back Father Because you 're going to need it Where are the stones
I remember you now..the so called art dealer
Zorg Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg nice to see you again
I 'm fucked
We 're saved
That 's what I 'm saying
And you do n't know how they open is that what you are saying
Yes of course but The Stones are shut They have to be open for it to work
There 's no light You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
Theoretically yes The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there but I do n't have the reference book I 've never seen the Stones work
Do n't tell me you do n't know how all this works
Uh Have you tried the Diva 's suite
When is she not in trouble
Leeloo 's in trouble
Yeah I know to save the world but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo
You 're probably very angry with me and I quite understand But I want you to know I 'm fighting for a noble cause
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world
What are you doing
Father I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends So thanks for the offer but no thanks
Of course
Good luck
We have to save the world
What kind of mission
We 're not going on vacation..we 're on a mission
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation
I 'm sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston
That 's what I thought
It means Never without my permission
Excuse me Just one thing She said something to me a while ago and I do n't really get it Akta Gamat
I know I was there when she arrived
She 's fine really..do n't you worry just needs some rest..she 's had a very long trip
I might call to check up on her you know to see if she 's better
Yes That 's fine Thank you very much A thousand times over
Dallas Korben Dallas
Thank you so much for your help Mr
She 's an exception
They all like this in your family father
Uh yes we 're cousins..distant cousins
So you do know her
There 's not a moment to lose Wake her up but be gentle about it This woman is mankind 's most precious possession She is perfect
You noticed
He 's a she
The girl
I brought the girl remember
Who are you
She dropped in on me holding this
That 's me But I do n't know who she is where did you find her
She 's not my bride she 's my fare She 's looking for this Vito Cornelius According to the phone guide he lives here
Weddings are one floor down Congratulations
Excuse me I 'm looking for a priest
This is government business now You ought to go home and get some rest Father
What are we going to do
Thank you Mr President
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop You ca n't even tell me what it is I ask you for options you give me bullshit Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards
White turns to black Light to Dark Life to Death For all eternity
But what happens if instead of this Ultimate Warrior it is EVIL who stands here
Yes..thank God
Is there anything that can stop it
And then it will be too late The goal of evil is to wipe out life All forms of life For all eternity Life upsets it
And then
We have forty-eight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
That 's exactly what we are going to try and do Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens General You may fire when ready
Time is of no importance Mr President Only life is important
Your theory is interesting Father but I do n't think we have time to go into it right now
One more reason to shoot first eh
Imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are Because it is evil TOTAL EVIL
Later David Later There 's not a minute to lose
You 're all safe Thanks be to God
It 's all my fault I 'm the servant It 's my mission Here
On the plane with Mr Dallas the real one
Where 's Leeloo
Good work my son Now all we need is a way to get there
I got it Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
Perfect
They really made her
I did n't know your size
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I did n't think anything of it What was his name I 'm so bad with names
Yes Of course
Uh father I know she 's been through a lot but the sacred stones..we do n't have much time
Learning our history The last 5000 years that she missed She 's been out of circulation a while you know
What 's she doing
Absolutely sure There 's the triple suns on her gloves
Father You sure she 's the Supreme Being
The Supreme Being the fifth element is here in our parish It 's a miracle
Father will you please explain what 's going on
I ca n't wear these clothes This calls for dignity I have to dress the part
What is
It 's a miracle
They are with me
I 'm sorry but the Stones
I would like to have died in peace
Listen the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her I never saw her again
I do n't have time I need to know
I I do n't know We hardly know each other it takes time
Do you love her
I 'll help her I promise but I think you should tell me where the Stones are
She was taught to love the life of others but not her own You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live
So Cornelius was telling the truth
Yes and more than that You must give her the Stones she 's the only one who knows how to use them
Leeloo is she 's
The Fifth Element The Supreme Being Your wife
Who
You 're a good man She was right to have chosen you
Leeloo
Uh huh..and I do n't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare
5 7 green eyes long legs great skin perfect
So just how big was this fare
Finger..man..I 'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap y'know one of those big fares you just ca n't resist
Hey bud I 'm waiting all day here
Hello

I do n't want a million I just want one A perfect one
You still pining for that two timing bitch Forget her There are a million women out there

We will be ready Lord
When EVIL returns so shall we
Time is of no importance only life is important
Knowing mankind as I do that could take centuries
When mankind comes to its senses We will return
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place
Take them and put them in a safe place

Old tricks are the best tricks eh
You could n't come up with something a little more discreet
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise For two Congratulations Here are your tickets
I 've had enough good news for today
Do n't you open your messages
You 're the only one left alive
And the third one
Two Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated
Three reasons One As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission
Just one why me
You 're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible Any questions
Where have I heard this song before
To save the world
What mission
Major Dallas if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance
I love you
Tell me
Because
Why Why would you need me
Yes you do I need you More than you can imagine Stand up straight
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine There is no need for me other than this I 'm immortal but I have no life
But I do n't know love I 'm like a machine programmed to save other people 's lives but never to have one of my own
Exactly
Like love
You 're right but there are lots of good things beautiful things
What 's the use of saving lives when you see what you do with them
Leeloo Listen to me I 'll take you on a vacation afterwards A real vacation this time for as long as you want Come on You can do it
I want to sleep forever
You can sleep tomorrow come on
I 'm so tired
It 's up to you now Angel
The rain falls

Five hundred wars Arms Drugs Money Everything you create is used to destroy
Why We did pretty well would n't you say

Apipoussan
Apipoussan

Apipoulai

An elephant could n't crack it
This thing solid
Wonderful
This is the crucial phase The reconstruction of pigment Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react to protect themselves That means growing skin Clever eh
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector The cell is for lack of a better word perfect
Is there any danger Some kind of virus
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours there are simply more of them tightly packed His knowledge is probably limitless
Yes I ca n't wait to meet him
Sounds like a freak of nature to me
This cell is like a huge library It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside Almost like it was engineered
Talk English Doc
It 's not that easy..we 've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000
Have you identified it
Actually only one cell survived
This is all that survived
How much time is left
They just landed in the desert
Do n't worry Sir I have the perfect one
I want your best man on this
What do you mean
The-Stones were n't aboard the ship
And the Stones Did you find them in the wreckage
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan They deplore the incident but accept our apologies
I 'm about to Mr President
Staedert What 's going on Did you destroy it

Those are two different kinds of trust Thank you for your time I hope we can do business
VELVET You trust me to keep your money but not to take your picture
I 'm camera shy
VELVET What 's the problem
I 'd rather you did n't
VELVET You have a beautiful face the way the light hits it I 'd like to take your picture You do n't mind
VELVET Well well I 'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this You 'll leave the money as a deposit Very good
We can do that
VELVET He might be interested but it would mean another five thousand
If it 's not him there 's no deal
VELVET Machine
And the other performer it has to be that monster you use the man in the mask
VELVET I 'll consider it
I want to watch you work
VELVET And they are
Five thousand now five thousand on delivery Two women one white and one black as long as they have large breasts Hard bondage or course Other than that trusting your artistic interpretation I have only two stipulations
VELVET Is it
That 's five thousand dollars
Yes What we 're looking for is rather specific
VELVET You said something about money
VELVET Hmm
A fellow investor
VELVET Flattering And who 's your colorful little chum
I 'd like to commission a work I 'm a great admirer of yours
VELVET What can I do for you today
It 's an honor to meet you Thank you for seeing us
VELVET You betrayed us
You got the guts tough guy Gon na kill us all is that it
VELVET First things first You might want to watch this Mr Welles
sorry
Fuck off
VELVET Leave him alone
You 're a dead man
Move it dirtbag
VELVET Do n't let Longdale 's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you you 'll be just as dead and so will Max
VELVET Put the gun down take the handcuffs Handcuff yourself to the bed
Is that him
It 's good what you 're doing
You 're gon na be seeing a lot of me You 're sure you do n't mind
It 's horrible but it 'll be your best friend after a few days I hope you realize what kind of long shot you 're chasing after
Any good
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance We try to keep the children and adults separate No eating or smoking in here but there 's a coffee machine in the hall
Well that 's all I can do Sorry
They were pretty clear they did n't want this coming back on them
I can give you my card if your clients want to call me
They 're putting themselves in place of this kid 's parents and thinking they 'd want to hear their girl 's okay even if that 's all they hear
I 'm not so sure about this
This doctor and wife they 're nice people but they do n't want to get too involved They 're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either You and I both know sometimes not often but sometimes there 's real reasons why a kid 'll run Molestation whatever Besides that the girl 's probably eighteen so she 's legal
Why do n't they come to me
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive
We do
I figured you share information
Why not go to the N.C.I.C or N.C.M.E.C
Few days ago I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia a doctor and his wife What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into Philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city Nice kid mature did n't have much to say but they got a sense she 's a runaway so all through dinner the doctor 's working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone Not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself That 's the last they saw her The reason they came to me for help the reason I 'm coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch They want to see if I can I.D this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid 's alive doing alright
Absolutely Of course I 'll abide by whatever decision you make but I 'd appreciate if you 'll hear me out
There are reasons for the way we do things here
What I 'd like very simply is access to your archive And now I understand this is n't something you normally do for private citizens
Alright Tom
Call me Tom
What can I do for you Mr Welles
What do you want You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby
That 's right you just stood there and watched because you felt like it Almost makes you worse
I never killed anyone
Easy enough for you
Do it Put me out of my misery so I do n't have to listen to you whining anymore You think it 's so easy
Do n't think I wo n't
Do it
I fucking do n't know What do you think we were n't burying treasure We did n't pace it out so we could come back and get it We dug a hole and we put her in it Your guess is as good as mine
Where Show me where
I do n't know out there somewhere
Show me where you buried her
You got absolute zero
Stop talking
You ca n't go to the cops All you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing
Where do you think you 're taking this huh Gon na be a big hero avenge that little girl 's death Gon na make everything right with the world How you gon na do that
Keep moving
Show me
Took it out the bathroom window Buried it in the woods
What did you do with her body
There was n't nobody around This place was a shit-hole I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries Dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and Machine went to work
Nobody saw you bring her in
What do you want to know You saw it you saw the loop
Tell me what happened
Made me sick but what did I care What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that It was just something I was doing for money
You enjoy it
I do n't know I felt like it I never saw anyone get done before
Because we 're going there
Why
Show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it
Fuck you then you want to know I talked her up told her how beautiful she was told her she was gon na be a star I told her I was gon na get her a screen test and while I 'm doing that I got her a soda and dropped a mickey When it was dark enough I rang Dino and told him it was go time I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it That 's what happened She 's dead She 's been dead a long fucking time Nobody fucking cares
I want to know I want to know exactly what you did to her
What the fuck do you want from me
What did you do knock her out shoot her up
Something like that
So you brought Dino in and he brought Machine And one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models And she never walked out
It was a lot of fucking money
That 's all Thirty each That 's all it took for you to murder her
Thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker
How much did he pay you
Yeah
Told him you could get him a snuff film
Yeah the fucking lawyer
Okay we 'll come back to that So six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it It 's Longdale looking for a snuff film And you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up
What the fuck am I gon na protect that freak for He was Dino 's boy not mine He shows up with his mask on leaves with his mask on Nobody knows
I will never get tired of hurting you Eddie so you might want to change your attitude
I told you I do n't know
I want his name
I do n't know
Who is Machine
What do you want
Starting to recognize a pattern
Fuck you
Do n't ask questions
How 'd you find me here
Do n't bore me with that bullshit
I 'm gon na kill you
One million dollars Dino How much did he tell you he had
What 's he talking about
You killed that girl and you put it on film You and your pals you 're fucked You fucked up real good
What the fuck are you
You murdered that girl Eddie Six years ago
Who is this
I know what you did
What
I know what you did
Yeah who 's this
Eddie
Celebrity Films
Fuck you
VOICE Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head Till then fuck you
Look you cocksucker
VOICE The only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap you 're peddling Eddie Where do you get this stuff
Maybe there 's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ever think of that
VOICE I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it
You know how my tapes sell People eat this stuff up
Look at him You think he played it square How much did he give you how much did he keep for himself
He 's lying
Go ahead shoot me Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield
Give me the film
You 'll get it when we get there
Give me the film
Fuck you
You almost went over your limit
Because he could He did it because he could What other reason were you looking for
Enlighten me
Is n't it incredibly obvious
Why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered
A man like Mr Christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain
I 'm asking
You 're asking me why
Just tell me Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared What kind of degenerate pervert was he really What the fuck did he want with a snuff film
You 're making me very angry
Did it get him off huh watching them cut her up Tell me because I really want to understand Did he jerk off to it You watch it with him sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched
Shut your mouth and drive
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered
Shut up
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right Wanted them to find you one Well they did n't find you one Longdale they went out and made you one
Mary Anne Mathews that was her name Her mom remembers her
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone If you were n't digging up a girl who died six years ago A girl no one even remembers
Except you 're willing commit murder with them
They 're no friends of mine
Followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies
Never mind how I found you
That 's why you got scared when Mrs Christian hired me You knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe How 'd you find me
I was well compensated
Must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything Would 've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money
That 's trust Mr Christian trusted me implicitly
So he sent you gave you the money his errand-boy And if you refused it was n't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film That 's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege
Would n't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
You were the middleman am I right Old man Christian was n't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
Well whatever reasons Mrs Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator I should certainly be a party to But since she feels differently I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
That 's right
You are a private investigator
Of what sort
As Mr Christian 's attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
I 'm listening
Yes I do have something to say I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs Christian contacted you
It 's not my money The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought Let 's not make a big deal out of this okay Go be a race car driver Go run for President Whatever
Look that 's awful generous and everything
It 's money People use it to purchase goods and services
What 's this
Nope
Still do n't want to tell me what you 're doing
I 'm trying to figure that out myself I have to see Machine without his mask
What 's next
Devil frightened me as much as it excited me but I 'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite
I know if I had to pick it 'd be Choke or Devil
What kind of Junior P.I would I be if I did n't go with you
You do n't need to be here
Nobody knows his name That 's his thing He always wears a mask You never see his face He calls himself Machine that 's what they call him Machine
Who is he his name
I told you he 's one of Dino Velvet 's stock players
Who is he
Who is this in the mask Who is he
Wha
It 's cheap and people know to mind their own business What have you got for me
Oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag
Great
It 's their Presidential Suite
You did n't say it was gon na be this luxurious
See ya
Consider it Meanwhile dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can Get receipts I 'll call back
You want me to come out there and play private eye
Take a vacation I 'll pay you four hundred a day plus expenses
I 'm a working stiff pops
Well I 'm in New York now What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images Thinks he 's making art
Alright I get the picture
Nothing illegal it 's always borderline Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look He 'll also do commissions for enough money
Where does he sell it
You 're learning
Specialty product
His stuff comes out of New York Bondage and fetish videos Gothic Hardcore Definitely not for the squeamish
A weirdo making S+M films Who 'd have thought it
Dino Velvet yeah he 's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks supposed to be a real weirdo
Good question
So you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this
A daughter
I see a ring on your finger You have any kids
What about me
You ca n't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb So what Am I gon na go off and be a race car driver Go to Harvard Run for President What about you pops
You 're telling me it does n't get to you
Yeah I 'm a real genius What choices have I got Fuck just because I know about stuff like tonight does n't mean I deal it I work a job It beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
I 'm not mixed up in anything hayseed What are you talking about
I do n't mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this
I do n't know where are yours
Where are your parents
Twenty-five
How old are you
First of all basement sales like tonight are n't gon na last much longer It 's too risky one and two everything 's going on the internet Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants It 's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks They 're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em But there 's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes No one knows where it comes from That 's local underground where information spreads by word of mouth Those are zombies hardcore junkies Their hands are permanently pruned They go out in the sun they do n't burn they blister Other than that all I know about is the mail Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes Secret couriers Credit card orders to dummy corporations Interstate wire transfers Revolving P.O boxes But if you 're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows That 's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops ca n't trace the deal There 's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is
What other ways are there to get illegal films Who do you see
I heard you asking That guy was n't yanking you around There 's no such thing
Snuff films
There 's two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal Foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she males hemaphrodites it 's beyond hardcore but legal This is the kind of hardcore where one guy 's going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love Now with some of the S+M and bondage films they straddle the line How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not Step over that line you 're into kiddie porn Rape films but there are n't many I 've never seen one
Child pornography
What you saw tonight we 're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend We 're talking about stuff where people get hurt Specialty product
Interesting theory
You 've got Penthouse Playboy Hustler etc Nobody even considers them pornography anymore Then there 's mainstream hardcore Triple X The difference is penetration That 's hardcore That whole industry 's up in the valley Writers directors porn stars They 're celebrities or they think they are They pump out 150 videos a week A week They 've even got a porno Academy Awards America loves pornography Anybody tells you they never use pornography they 're lying Somebody 's buying those videos Somebody 's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex Know what else It 's only gon na get worse More and more you 'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream because that 's evolution Desensitization Oh my God Elvis Presley 's wiggling his hips how offensive Nowadays Mtv 's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out Know what I mean For the porn-addict big tits are n't big enough after a while They have to be the biggest tits ever Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head literally Soon Playboy is gon na be Penthouse Penthouse 'll be Hustler Hustler 'll be hardcore and hardcore films 'll be medical films People 'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds There 's nowhere else for it to go
Wake up pops Your education begins tonight
Hello
See you then Oh and do n't call me pops
Tomorrow night I get off at eight
Here 's my number if you need it When can you start
Sounds good pops
Okay let 's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump I 'll give you six hundred for a few days
Four hundred a week off the books
How much do you make now
How much
Well there 's the thing you 're not gon na know anything about what I 'm doing but you can make some money
From Pennsylvania P.I from PA What are you doing out here
Not quite
You 're a private eye Like Shaft
I 'm not a cop
You 're not a cop are you If I ask and you are you have to tell me
Well whatever there is whoever 's dealing however it 's done I want to know I want a good look so if you 've got that kind of connection great If not speak now
There 's not much illegal
Well here 's the deal Max This thing I 'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography Stuff that 's sold under the counter illegally
Max
What 's your name if you do n't mind me asking
Three four years
How long you been working there
Good for you
I do n't know what you 're looking for mister but so we 're clear from the start I 'm straight
Thomas Welles Nice picture
I need some information Thought you might be able to help
Came back for that battery-operated vagina right Told you you would
Remember me
Might get drummed out of the pornographer 's union and then where would I be
Would n't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts
I tear off the cover and paste this one on You know how it is
Truman Capote
Catchy title What are you really reading Hard to believe that book 's got any parts worth highlighting
Once you pick it up you ca n't put it down
I 'll risk it
It 's your call but you 're gon na be sorry when you 're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you do n't have one
Well it 's tempting but no thanks
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling
Pardon me
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina
Yeah guess so
Big date tonight
If you have a pencil and paper I 'll tell you how to send it
CHRISTIAN How will I get it to you
I 've got about five thousand left in cash but I 'll need another thirty if you approve
CHRISTIAN Fine
I 've made progress I 'm in Manhattan Once a few more pieces fall into place I 'll drive to you and give you an update
CHRISTIAN Nothing more than a bother Have you any news for me
I hope it 's nothing serious
CHRISTIAN I 've been ordered into bed The doctor says I 've gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment
I do n't know if luck 's the word Are you feeling alright
CHRISTIAN How are you Having any luck
Mrs Christian Tom Welles here
CHRISTIAN Hello
You 're one hell of a detective Mrs Christian
CHRISTIAN You told me to look so I looked
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged No return address You dug this up all by yourself
CHRISTIAN Okay
For a human life murder on film no statute of limitations Who knows It sure could have I 'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
CHRISTIAN Do you think the film could have cost that much
I 'm here
CHRISTIAN Hello
CHRISTIAN To the penny Exactly one million dollars in cash
You 're joking
CHRISTIAN Totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
Okay I follow you so far
CHRISTIAN One was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents Another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
CHRISTIAN The checks were for odd amounts
I 'm not positive this means anything
CHRISTIAN My husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
Okay
CHRISTIAN I know what I 'm asking Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk You 'll need cash to buy information and I 'll provide it I feel responsible Mr Welles You saw what he did to her
Nothing remotely like this
CHRISTIAN You 've found missing persons before
I deal in divorce cases Corporate investigations
CHRISTIAN Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously I 've thought about it and there 's no other way If you ca n't find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well I ca n't let that happen I 'm telling you I wo n't If there 's no chance that poor girl 's memory can be served then I 'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
It wo n't work like that
CHRISTIAN No For me to live with the ruin of my husband 's name I need know that whoever did this will be punished If you can find them I will take their names to the police I 'll say my husband confessed on his death bed I 'll say I did n't have courage to come forward at first
You do n't have any other choice
CHRISTIAN I told you I ca n't not yet
You you need to go to the police
Of course But I 'm certain it 's nothing to worry about
CHRISTIAN Will you watch it and see for yourself
I 'm sure it is It 's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke More than likely he never even watched it
CHRISTIAN I 'm telling you it 's not that
If you were to study it you 'd see the camera cutting away you 'd see the tricks they can play
CHRISTIAN No
Please believe me This is probably a stag film Simulated rape Hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
Mrs Christian please will you sit down a moment I want you to listen carefully What you 're talking about is a snuff film But from what I know snuff films are a kind of urban myth Like red light district folklore There 's no such thing I can assure you
CHRISTIAN I did n't know what to think I ca n't tell you how horrible it 's been to know this belonged to my husband To know that he watched this this atrocity But I ca n't go to the police
CHRISTIAN This is a movie showing a girl being murdered She 's sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife I only watched what I could
I 'm afraid I do n't
CHRISTIAN It 's a film of a girl being murdered
CHRISTIAN Cash stock certificates and this
Do you want to tell me what you found
CHRISTIAN There was nothing he could do My husband left everything to me I prevented anyone from seeing the contents I felt these were my husband 's private things I did n't I did n't realize
You hired someone to open it I 'll bet the lawyer loved that
CHRISTIAN My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe I knew about it but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business Not till now that is
CHRISTIAN Just curious
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to Other than that there 's never any reason
CHRISTIAN Do you carry a gun Mr Welles
CHRISTIAN We were married forty-five years Hard even for me to imagine We had our troubles There were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and I to him I loved him deeply
He succeeded
CHRISTIAN Mostly That 's where he started his empire building He was a good man Notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated He wanted to be legendary
Pittsburgh
I 'll do whatever I can to help
CHRISTIAN His passing has left me with something of a dilemma A terrible terrible dilemma
My condolences
CHRISTIAN As you know my husband passed away recently Two weeks ago now
CHRISTIAN You are highly recommended Praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality
I 've been privileged to provide services for people I admire
CHRISTIAN I 've spoken to friends of mine and my husband 's in Harrisburg in Lancaster and Hershey Asking about you I must say you have friends in influential places
CHRISTIAN He 's a lawyer Please sit here
He 's odd
Thank you
CHRISTIAN Have a pleasant evening Will you have tea Mister Welles
CHRISTIAN Apparently Mr Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak
Uh huh pleasure
I try to be
CHRISTIAN Mister Welles You 're very prompt
They murdered her Mrs Mathews I 'm sorry It happened a month after she ran away She 's been dead all this time
MATHEWS Why why are you doing this to me
They killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her
MATHEWS No no no
He raped her and and and he murdered her he cut her up with knifes
MATHEWS No
They brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
MATHEWS Who are you
Someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her
MATHEWS Who is this
Mrs Mathews your daughter is dead She 's dead
MATHEWS What
She went to California to Los Angeles she wanted to start over She wanted to be an actress
MATHEWS What are you talking about
I have to tell you something It wo n't be easy for you to hear It 's about your daughter Mary Anne When I when I was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware If you read it you 'll know what I 'm telling you is true
MATHEWS I remember You just left
Mrs Mathews It 's Thomas Do you remember I was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
MATHEWS Hello
MATHEWS What am I supposed to do Forget her Time heals all wounds right She 's all I think about and I 've learned to live with that But you want the truth the real truth If I had a choice if I had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing I 'd choose to know
It 's been six years
MATHEWS I think about it everyday But every time the phone rings every single time I still think it 's her
MATHEWS Yes
You were right I did n't find anything I 'm going to run and get something to eat Are you hungry
You 're probably right and I probably wo n't find anything I do n't have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and there 's a part of me that ca n't let it go Police are just as human as you or I They could have missed something They probably did n't Would n't you rather know
MATHEWS My husband never laid a hand on her She would have told me she would have told me
Will you let me look
MATHEWS How how can you say that to me
If the police focused their search in her room her belongings well that 'd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place
MATHEWS No You do n't have any reason to think that
It is possible and I know this is n't something you want to hear Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it She might have wanted to tell you something
MATHEWS I do n't know I think so
Do you think the police did a good job
MATHEWS There was n't one The police looked
It 's not really my place but it 's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either See I know a little about missing persons When kids run they almost always leave a note It 's guilt They want to say goodbye
MATHEWS What
I 've got what I need for my report There is there is one thing that bothers me though
MATHEWS You should be
No
MATHEWS Are you religious
We 're all like that
MATHEWS Does n't make much sense does it When everything 's happy when life 's fine and you have every reason to believe there 's a God you do n't bother Then something horrible happens that 's when you start praying all the time That 's when you start going to church
MATHEWS Okay
I I should n't take anymore of your time Maybe we can finish tomorrow I 'll call tomorrow
Of course
MATHEWS People remember me from the news Can you drive me back now
MATHEWS No one knows what it 's like You ca n't even imagine how much it hurts
I had to ask I apologize
MATHEWS You try going through what we did Bob could n't take it that 's all Christ there 's times when it still seems like I ca n't either
I did n't mean to
MATHEWS There was n't anything like that The police and the FBI people asked but there was n't anything happened like that never My husband his heart broke when Mary left
You have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter Were there any indications of any sort of abuse
MATHEWS It got to be too much for him
Why do you think he did it
MATHEWS We were divorced by then Things fell apart he was living with a friend
September 4th 1993 About a year after Mary disappeared
MATHEWS Yes
If there 's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but I have to ask Your husband he committed suicide
MATHEWS I do n't know
What was she running from
MATHEWS She did n't seem herself For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it One night we went to bed the next morning she was gone She took some clothes
She just seemed depressed
MATHEWS No
So she did n't leave a note She never gave any indication where she might go before she left
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat Drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses Want to know what it 's really like It 's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wife 's cheating on him Glamorous huh And the guy who hired you he has a hair-lip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife 's cheating and you do n't blame her
MATHEWS I did n't think there were private detectives anymore except on TV
That 's exactly what I am
MATHEWS They hired you You 're like a private detective
It 's very important you do n't let this raise your expectations It 's not going to effect any ongoing efforts All I 'm saying is please know I 'm not here to create any false hope
Well I 'm following up on your daughter Mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair Born April 24 1976 Missing June 11th 1992 A runaway that 's how she 's listed Is this information correct
MATHEWS No
Right Agent Cole told me he 'd call and let you know to expect me He did n't call
MATHEWS Neil Neil Cole
What was the name I 've got it here somewhere
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected functioning hand in hand with law enforcement The R.C.M.P brought me in to review their investigations fact-check their records see if there 's anything they missed anything they should be doing different I 'm here for a few days before I head back up to Virginia These reports go to the Justice Department eventually I spoke to your F.B.I contact a few days ago uh
MATHEWS Yes but
I 'm sorry let me explain the R.C.M.P is a support organization and archive not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington I 'm sure you 've dealt with them before
MATHEWS I do n't understand who are
I 've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit If you have any time over the next few days I 'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter
Hello Mrs Mathews my name 's Thomas Jones I 'm a state licensed investigator
MATHEWS Yes
I 'll do what I can
She was the kindest sweetest girl you 'd ever want to meet Oh I adored her I supposed I always hoped she 'd be back After a time all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things Can you get this suitcase to her parents if you think it 's appropriate
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time
That 's her suitcase I had forgotten it till you showed me her picture
Her belongings
Those are her belongings
What is this
I 'm trying to find out She was a runaway I 'm looking into it for her parents
Do you know what happened to her
Yes I remember her
You you do You 're sure Please Sister will you take another look make sure
Yes I remember Mary
Certainly Senator If I can ever be of further assistance
Yes Mister Welles thank you
The um you 'll find my invoice in the envelope If that 's all
He 's an imbecile I tried to warn my daughter but what can you do
No sir he is not
None too discreet is he
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day saw that woman every night The specifics are in the report and information about the woman It 's unpleasant I know I apologize
Certainly sir
Yeah I know the spiel If you could bag it I 'll be on my way thank you
I 'm required by state law to inform you that while it 's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of
Okay Fine
No you may not
Alright May I have your phone number area code first
Cash
Excellent we accept MasterCard and American Express
Okay I 'll take it all
Then we 'll stay up together
Figure it out I 'll be insane before I figure it out The only thing I 'm sure of is that I ca n't go to sleep Not while he 's using me
We 'll figure it out
I have n't slept much either Since Kristen
I ca n't go back to sleep again
Yeah or turn you into toast
It is was It 's a zapper it might help me stay awake
Hey since when do you play Thomas Edison This looks like Sheila 's
I ca n't find him
Does n't the dream master work for you anymore
It was bad
I heard you screaming Was it a bad one
Kristen
You alright
What
Kincaid and Joey died last night
What 's wrong
Alice you think you can leave
Never say ca n't Just do what I do
Rick I ca n't
Look you got ta stand up for yourself Learn to fight back
But she would n't let Dad treat me like that
Yeah She 'd be half as strict as you
I do n't want to
The mirror You ca n't see yourself in it
What
Do n't you think it kind of defeats the purpose
You 'll hear all kinds of stories They 'll tell you it was murder but it was n't
Kristen what happened
When I used to have nightmares I brought my friends in to help me Until they all started dying
You what
When they 're all you have you kinda become an expert
How 'd you learn so much about dreams
I daydream you have to dream about some place fun Remember you 're in control
Great you would n't happen to know his phone number
No really it 's a fable The 'guardian of good dreams It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up
Sounds like a game show host to me
My mom taught me when I was little Did you ever hear of the dream master
You could do worse
I love to dream I just hate ones about my dad
Yeah I 'm not so sure
I 'm sure they 're around
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid God I ca n't find them I ca n't find them anywhere
Here you are Where were you this morning Rick 's looking all over for you
Saw who I was up all night cramming for this physics test and I was putting this little baby together Look
Then you saw him too
That obvious huh
You 've been up all night
What
We have matching luggage
Ohhhhbaby I am dead on my feet
I know
Maybe you should n't be working here so much You do n't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life
I know I hardly have any time to study
I got ta get to the library before it closes Killer physics test
You in a hurry
Save it for later Come on
You look great
Debbie She 's gone I 've collected her like the others
What the hell was that
Something 's wrong here It feels like
Here we are
You know I get the weirdest feeling we 've been through this before
He 's going after Debbie I got ta stop him
It 's okay we 're just about there
As long as your driving does n't kill us
Cut that shit out Maybe before but not now I want to help you I 'm on your side
You just feel sorry for me
Hey you 're not alone We have to stop him I 'm with you
He 's going after Debbie I got ta stop him
Who
Try what other kids did Keep each other awake We 'll meet at Debbie 's tonight At least if we do n't sleep he ca n't get us
Then what else can we do
Yeah right Let 's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room Adults wo n't see it They ca n't
Why ca n't we just talk to the authorities
You do n't really get it He 's not a nightstalker It 'll take more than bench presses to beat him
I do n't think so I guess this is my own war
Is there something we can do
Not really
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy Maybe Freddy ca n't get to new kids without someone like me Someone to bring them to him
Alright let 's assume this whole thing is true Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you
Three days
How long have you been awake
The story is the deaths you ca n't argue with
No offense or anything but it 's kind of hard to swallow
Look you know why you just do n't believe me
Extra money huh
I 've been working double shifts
Kristen 's story really got to her
No do n't I gave Sheila to him and now she 's dead
In her dream
I was there in the dream He took her It was awful It was awful
It was no suicide It was not an accident It was Freddy and he 's coming back for seconds thirds and fourths
I thought it was an accident Smoking in bed
I know Uh Alice
Tell him I was looking for him okay I 'm Dan
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen She was n't feeling very well
You 're his sister right
No
I saw it It was my dream I brought Sheila in
Enough of that crap
It was Freddy
Asthma attack what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack She was gon na be a doctor
Give her time Beauty is skin deep
I think Sheila 's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them
Alright I think I see salvation
Rick please
What else You ever look over this town 's history Not a safe place to be a teenager Anyway if I 'm next watch your back
About Freddy
She 's blaming herself for Sheila I know how it feels I 've been thinking about Kristen Maybe I could 've stopped it if I 'd listened
How she doing I ran into her last night
Been up with Alice
She knew she was gon na die
Hey man we 're all sorry
Now it gets weird She says he comes back in dreams If he kills you there you 're dead for real
Nice neighborhood
It pissed off a lot of parents According to Kristen they hunted him down roasted him alive
So
She told us the story of Freddy It 's a town legend He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality
So what 's up What 'd I miss
Let me talk to you
I do n't get it
Excuse me ladies I 'll just be a moment
Hey Rick
Earth to Alice
T-T-Thanks Alice
Mother you 've just murdered me Take that to your goddamn therapy
Honey we went over this in therapy
Sorry Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who 's now after me In case you have n't been keeping score it 's his fucking banquet and I 'm the LAST COURSE
I 'm sorry honey but
Your distraught It 'll help
What 's wrong with me
You 're just tired Do n't think I have n't noticed your not sleeping That has to stop honey
Well Mom I 'll tell ya when two of your friends die the same day you let me know what it does to your appetite
Something the matter with the cuisine
I told you you ca n't help This is n't a normal nightmare I 'm doomed
It 's okay babe We 're with you
It 's no just a house It 's his home He 's waiting there for me to dream
I 'll tell you later
It 's no story It happened Freddy 's real and he 's back
I though Freddy was just an old town story
Now you know who and what Freddy really is
Oh God He killed them
What is it
When dad 's popping aspiring like popcorn it 's avoid-all-contact-day
What
Avoid-all-contact-day
Something wrong with the stairs
Do n't worry honey
You do n't get it he 's after me
You just stay put You need rest
I got ta get out of here
You had a nasty bump
Yeah I guess so What happened
Feeling better now
You 're not taking my baby
JORDAN We know you 've been through a lot but there 's more than your feelings at stake here
What are you talking about My condition
JORDAN In your present condition Alice we 're worried about your ability
JORDAN And ours It 's our grandchild
Look I appreciate what you 're offering but no He is my responsibility
What I what Well I 've thought about it I plan to keep him
JORDAN Frankly dear we wondered what you intend to do with our baby
It 's okay Dan
JORDAN Excuse us dear
He says it 's easy Especially with sad people With closed-off people
But how
It 's where he hides out Inside That 's how he found me
What do you mean
He 's inside you where he hides
Where is he
Come on downstairs He wo n't hurt you He needs us both
Mommy
My friend with the funny hand
Who says I do n't like you
Who said I wait what
No you 're not You do n't even care about being a mom How come you do n't think about me
Oh I 'm sure that 's not true I 'll bet she 's very worried about you I would be
She does n't want me around
I do n't think this is a nice place for you to be Maybe we should go find your Mom
No
Is that who you 're waiting for
Been having bad dreams
Hi you do n't look very well Are you feeling all right
I could tell you were sad I just wanted to see if you were all right
How did you know that
I 'm sorry your boyfriend got killed
My name is
It 's lonely in there in my room
Should n't you be in your room Jacob
Huh
Hey wake up
Me too
There you go Love you
You 're right
You do n't dream him up he ca n't hurt you Or me Or us Remember
Yeah I guess
You stopped it did n't you It was probably just a regular bad dream
No Well not exactly it 's that I felt like I was n't in control For the first time since all that I 'm scared
About him
He 'll show up C'mon what 's really wrong
Nothing it 's just I did n't see my father at the ceremony
Okay babe What 's the matter
I know
They 're coach seats but the plane lands in Paris It 's gon na be a helluva summer hon
The tickets
Sorry babe
Jesus Do n't do that
Hi beautiful
'S DAD Now
But Dad
'S DAD No I wo n't have you running around in the middle of the night You 're coming home
I 've got to go
'S DAD Alice
'S DAD No I 'm not I sort of hope it 's a boy Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again
You disappointed in me
'S DAD Since my little girl became a mom
Since when are you such a smart shopper
'S DAD Alice
Very funny
'S DAD Sobering
How was the meeting
Daddy he 's coming back Krueger 's coming back Make them understand
'S DAD I 'm so sorry honey
It 's just across the park
'S DAD You sure you do n't want a ride to work
Thanks for everything Dad
To take a picture
'S DAD Where are we going
'S DAD It 's the model you 've been saving up for I wanted you to have it for your trip
Dad
'S DAD No A deal 's a deal
That 's in the past Unless you 've stopped going to the meetings
'S DAD I watched from behind the stands Did n't want to embarrass you ya know The drunk showed up that kind of thing
I was afraid you were n't coming
That 's okay He 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep
He sure loves to stay awake
So did Dan
You do good work Alice
We 've got to go to the asylum and find her body Mark said her soul 's trapped with it that 's why she ca n't come to me It must be
But how are we gon na
Jacob We 've got to get to Amanda before it 's too late
What
If they actually bothered to bury her
You think that 's the place she 's buried
Yeah So that 's him And you 're not crazy
Are you alright
That 's the only reason you 're alive
Look we 're all tired None of us had any sleep since Friday night
Goddamn it Yvonne You do n't just run away from this guy He finds you in your dreams
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman Why do n't you take off leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while
What do you think I 'm doing Look Whether you believe it or not Krueger is back He 's after the baby and if I do n't try to do something about it who will
And so is your baby You 've got more than just yourself to think of now
Krueger is reality
I am your friend and I 'm worried sick about you But you 're like a locked safe You 've got ta start dealing with reality
I just ca n't figure out how he 's getting in when I 'm awake
I really think you need to calm down now okay
Mark knows I 'm not crazy Ask him to show you his hands
Oh Alice no Honey I love you but you 're going to have to get a hold of yourself
I think Krueger 's trying to do something to it
You had me scared on the phone What 's wrong with the baby
Why do n't you two stick to reality
I do n't understand what 's happening Krueger has to use my dreams but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake How 's he doing it
No accident I tried to warn all of you about Krueger
It was just an accident Like with Dan
When Dan died you were n't even asleep You said so End of story
What 's that got to do with it
They 're waiting for us but let 's keep this dream stuff between you and me
Did everyone call everyone
He must 've wandered up from the children 's ward I just wondered what was wrong with him
There are n't any little boys on your floor
Have you visited the little boy on my floor Jacob the one who looks kind of sad
Alice it 's no dream I 'm sorry Dan 's dead
It was no accident It was Krueger He used to get in through my dreams but not anymore He 's found some other way
Yeah before they revoke his diploma
Good to see you again Mr Grey I 've got to go find Dan
No the Dan part was nice
Dan keeping you up again Put a lock on that window girl
Had kind of a long night
Hey what 's wrong with you let 's see a smile
She killed herself Her soul 's gon na be in torment
I do n't understand
No shit
Poor woman
Empty plot Memorial stone Vacant They never did put her under Cool huh
But I 've seen her grave
They could n't prove it No body Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business
Meaning
That 's what the newspapers thought She spent the rest of her life in the asylum After Krueger 's trial she flipped out and hung herself so they thought
No it 's our problem Mark If I do n't deal with this they really might try to take Jacob You said she committed suicide
That 's their problem
They think I 'm nuts
Then we 'll find another way
I could n't do that Mark He 's my last link with Dan No I want him
I 'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr Fred Krueger
Where are you going
I do n't know
Whoa slow down How 're you gon na hide from a guy like that leave the planet
What you named it already
My baby
Who 's Jacob
Why do n't I go make some coffee There 's a lot to tell
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy
It was n't her mother The only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party
Maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that Polly Perfect shit
Nobody thinks that
Do you think I 'm an idiot for being in love with her
Mark
Then get out
She must 've fallen asleep at the table
I thought about that
I 'm very fucking sorry but Greta is dead today Could we interest you in someone else
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta And
Yeah I 'm just aces
Mark are you okay
That 's why it 's my fault Dan 's dead
I 've got to write some of this down
Well we got ta do something
My dad 's got this thing about drinking in the house
Greta come on One burger with me
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis
I think I 'm starting to wear her down Have some anyway
Give up Mark it 's hopeless
I do n't believe this All that gore you paint in the comics and you 're squeamish
Oh man I could 've gone all night without looking at that
Oh he was this ancient guy I read about who like killed his kids 'cause they did n't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should
Who
He 's right Sometimes I feel like I 'm living with Melicertes
You know my mother get real What about Alice 's
That club sucks they card everybody Let 's just party at your place
Pimples heartburn cellulite and no modeling career
Meet me later Milkshakes Cherry pie Banana splits And no mom
My undying love Have some
Next life Oh what 's that
Yeah when are you gon na come to your senses
All of us Right
Bottom line Alice Anybody supernatural or not that wants to hurt you he 'll have to go through us first
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy
Look Dan 's parents were pushing him Pushing him hard He was bitching about it at the party last night He was under pressure We all are
I want to talk about the baby
Stop saying that it 's bullshit
Nah It 's getting too cold for me and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair She 's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night
Naah I 'm done Got to be on shift in a couple hours Are n't you going in
Have another one sounds like you need it
That means they 're gon na give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I 'm done
Yeah
All right kids I tell you what we 're gon na do I 've got swimming practice until six-thirty today
Makes you look like a nun
These things are wild What do you think
He invited me to his house last night
You too
Stick around please
It 's okay
I ca n't listen to this
I 'm not finished I loved Greta A lot And if maybe just maybe someone or some thing killed her I 'd like to hear about it
Mark
Why do n't you shut up and let her talk Two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal
Faint
Vomit
Two hours a day six days a week
Dan And he 's taking Alice with him pretty good dive Yvonne You 've been practicing
And his 'egghead son We 'll give 'em a u rough u u reception u wo n't we
I would n't worry So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark and people like you the Skipper Dave Kent Sir Ian and my father
I do n't know
But if they u do u
Maybe just 'maybe when their ship does n't return they 'll decide not to come here after all
Which is the one we have to worry about
Yes
They 're so remote cold beautiful the stars But now I wonder
I 'd sooner swim
However our ideas disagree as I 've said before I 'm u not u a coward And it happens you 've got no choice Either u I u take you down there in the Lungfish or you do n't get there
any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does
That 's enough Holloway I 've told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine does n't auto matically endow you with back bone
Then this is a 'flying saucer
Unidentified Flying Objects
You may not u win u them But without men like your father to 'degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them they 'd have disappeared u long u ago
Peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit Show me a man who says you win u those u by fighting wars and u I 'll u show you an idiot
You mean u nothing u is worth fighting for
Perhaps But the idea of willingly going to u school u to spend my u life u at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards I 'm referring to War u that u strikes me as the u worst u cowardice of all being spiritually yellow
You 're really a mixed-up oddball are n't you
That may be But Dad stays where u he u is and I 'm staying here
We 're u all u risking our lives
Wearing a uniform does n't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage u Commander u It just so happens I 'm u not u a coward physical or mental and before I 'd risk my father 's life
u You u said it But I wo n't argue
You 'trade school boys are all alike are n't you Anybody who does n't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is ipso facto a coward
Your father can be in Nome Alaska tomorrow We have two choices Ask them to send him out in a 'copter and take you off or the Shark can put back into Nome
What did you mean I 'm 'out
Dead Matter of fact he 's much better He 's left the hospital
My father He 's not
Your 'out This came for you
What is it
Not in two days Look Do you think I u wanted u to come If it did n't mean so much to Dad proving his depth-explorer it 's the last thing I 'd want
You could train someone else
And they thought u you u could re place the Skipper
It was moderate He 'll be all right But it was out of the question his coming along
How is he
It was supposed to be Dad had a heart attack two days ago
I should have suspectcd when I heard that 'Doctor I thought it was your father
What 's goin on in here Lad What
Dave
Oh it does
Here keep these It wants me to come alone
I 'm with u you u
Well
We 'll have to look for them later
Wonder where Powell and Carney are
Somewhere down there
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from
The sound again
You hear that
Let 's get back to work and maybe we u will u be soon
And if I did n't u know u better I 'd swear we were moving
You know it u is u
Hey you know somethin It 's getting lighter in here
Strange you did n't hear it OMIT 274F
I do n't hear anything Maybe you 've been down here too long Why do n't you go back up and
Listen Hear that
Yeah
Go back and tell Dr Neilsen Have him report to the Skipper
I think you 're right
What 's more important there 's our problem The bow ram the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break If we can cut the ram the Shark can pull herself loose
How about that The bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up
Not u alone u you 're not
You all wait here I 'm going inside take a look
Reef and I can take the Explorer down clamp it around the eye and
'Us
You 've got to let us try Skipper
Skipper Look at the depth gauge
We 're stuck tight
Sounds like it Distress call from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland One mayday then nothing
Cyclops
'His side I 've seen it all right A nice bright yellow
Have you ever talked to Carl tried to see his side
But u they 're u not Skipper Neilsen 's son It broke his heart Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest sincere son of a war-mongering father Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy Oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish but it broke him all the same
A lot of people think like that
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist A real egghead do-gooder and crackpot 'Ban the atom tests Junk the nuclear subs Spend the mili tary budgetfor peace
So
One of the finest men and officers alive A real hero in the best sense of the word in World War Two He taught us Engineering and Design Fought like a demon to develop atom subs
I guess
I guess Skipper Neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the Academy did n't he
I might have a son like u that u
Huh
You 've asked why I stay a bachelor There goes the best reason I know
Disappointing a u big u girl
What could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
u That 's u the worst possible moment
At the worst possible moment Tomorrow is Janie 's birthday Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home Now
So they caught up with you too
Reef
Helen I appeal to you
But Julie 's a nice girl and I 've seen you work She deserves a fighting chance
Now Dave Old Buddy you know you 're exaggerating What do you think of this husband of yours On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer But unfortunately in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself
We hope
Sidearms But the saucer 's dead
With their underwater experience they 'll be invaluable Take sidearms and flare pistols
The frogmen
You better take Powell and Carney with you
Right at our one-eyed friend
What course Skipper
What
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo
Speed about twenty-two knots Course due north
Course and speed
I do n't know
What about down
Seems to be all around
Is there any way out of it
Right Skipper
Get ready We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard
What
We 're dead in the water But it indicates we 're moving
Why do you say that
The inertial navigation system Must have been knocked out in the crash
Something wrong
Skipper could you take a look here
All internal repairs completed and Frogmen report exterior damage minor
Yes Griff
Excuse me Skipper
What about time
It 's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM so it would 'home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole
Anything
Excuse me Captain there may be one last desperate chance a one-in-a-thousand shot
Radiation level constantly rising
Now they feel it down below
That 's wonderful Carl Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose
Wonderful
We read you Go ahead Doctor They 're inside the saucer It 's filled with breathable air
As ready as we u can u be I 'll report to the Skipper
IAN All ready
IAN There is I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life
There 's got to be an explanation
IAN As we near the Pole
IAN What direction does the system indicate
The radiation level from the saucer it 's rising
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
IAN in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it 'recharging his batteries
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the Earth itself
IAN u We u harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force Maybe Cyclops does it on a u super u scale
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear But suppose it is n't at all what if it 's u magnetic u
IAN What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit Perhaps be lying there waiting
Suppose our theorizing is correct Then this u could u be the next danger point
IAN above Murmansk and Finland
High-intensity arcs will burn submerged And millions of volts discharged in random directions
IAN Under u water u
It does n't seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center
Minus three
What 's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole
Nothing we can do now
Straight to the Pole at almost fifty knots
If we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the Shark loose
What
Suppose there 's an atmosphere of some kind inside Cyclops
And we 're at safe maximum depth already Stop engines
It 's the screws Skipper At our declination angle running in reverse they 're pulling the Shark u and u Cyclops right to the bottom
A hundred and eighty fathoms We ca n't be sinking that fast
We can u ram u him
But what can we accomplish
That 's what I said
Right u at u him
Thirty-four seconds
What 's the running time
Take a look
You 're sure it 's Cyclops
After torpedo room Report
Determine extent of damage immediately
I think I should have joined the Air Force
What do you think
It 'll be all right We 're old friends
Huh
'Doctor Neilsen When did u that u happen
Dr Neilsen He 'll be
Who with
I 'm afraid I have some bad news for you Reef You 'll have to share quarters this trip
I met Dr Kent once
I did go Just back Reef these are a couple of our passengers Sir Ian Hunt and Dr Clifford Kent My exec Commander Richard Holloway
Thought you were going to Washington Skipper
u That u might be a u little u u rough u
VOICE Obviously
To navigate wo n't you have to see your way
VOICE Of course But it is time to be gin the return voyage
That 's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
VOICE It is a living thing When damaged you would say 'wounded it immediately 'heals itself
VOICE I have selected you to return with me along with several other specimens for study We will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers
Why
VOICE On the contrary I want you unharmed perfect
Why not me What am I the closing act
VOICE I am afraid not Therefore
He did
VOICE Your friend was to remain where he was
Swell
for horrors like yourself
VOICE My mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization
Tell me something Why can u I u hear you when the others could n't
VOICE Point of view is everything To us u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you
That 's a u face u
Come where
VOICE Remove your weapons Commander And come here alone
All right go to it
IAN Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks
IAN Toward the Pole
Due north At five knots no six
But u answers u are what we need not more questions
IAN We 've asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times
IAN Or perhaps until he gets us
You plotted the course of Cyclops Then that 's u our u course Wherever u he u goes u we u go until we get him
Our 'Cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
IAN Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary and the legend of Homer 'Cyclopes were the Sons of Heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by Zeus
IAN I 'll be another
Well I 'll be
IAN The pattern Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
See what
IAN Thank you
My yeoman will show you to your quarters
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman In a year or two you wo n't recognize this town
He musta found out They had to get rid of him And Jack 'll get blamed
No
Twombley involved
I went down to Concord to check it out The president is Mel Gordon The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere Those boys are buying up the mountain Wade 364,000 this year I believe that 's out of LaRiviere 's league
What is the Northcountry Development Association
This is from three years ago Some difference huh
As a mater of fact yes LaRiviere
Has anybody offered to buy it
I know he 's due for the last two years I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in
About Jack No Have you checked out the tax bill on your father 's farm lately
You do n't believe me
Sometimes things are simpler than you think Let me ask you a question
if Jack told the truth he could be free by the time he 's my age
You know Jack Hewitt the kid I work with
Who
Evan Twombley the union boss who got shot Somebody murdered him
Who
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to What I 'm talking about I 'm talking about murder Among other things

Yeah I know The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her I 'm not as dumb as I look Whatever you say I love my daughter I 'll send you the five hundred
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
Oh
Hard to say If we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on Ten or twelve thousand dollars She could win on appeal If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming they 're unduly restrictive it would n't be more than twenty-five hundred
Jesus How much how much will the whole thing cost
Fine I 'll need a 500 retainer You can mail it
Yes
No not exactly I 'll look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn Interview your daughter Jill right

You Why
Wade that was n't smart Going out right after the man 's father-in-law shot himself Let it go Call it a favor to me
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him Sonofabitch would n't accept it
So

What do I have to do for it
Elaine Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade 's car fix the clutch

You want me to follow them to Littleton
That must 've been Twombley Jesus I bet that was Twombley
Like hell
You ai n't the hunter Jack is And he ca n't drive the grader worth shit
I wish you had I 'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader

He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something That 's what usually happens
Yes Wade I mean Twombley Put out that cigarette Fuck Fuck Fuck

You make me sick I ca n't believe you 've sunk so low
No problem Look I
Hi honey
See Get your boots
Yeah lots
Wait there She 'll be right out Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford
Let the past be I 'm sorry about your mother I liked her You never know how much women like that suffer It 's like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then they 're gone
It 's just
We 've done all our talking Wade
We should talk
No not anymore It 's too it 's too far
You ever come to your father 's grave anymore
I 'm not making it any worse You are Me and Jill could 've worked this thing out It 's normal it 's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it Believe it or not How do you think this makes me look treating her like some tragic victim or something
Do n't cause a scene No one 's trying to win any 'rounds Do n't make it any worse
I do n't want her to go Lillian
Oh Jesus lay off will you It looks like you 've won this fucking round already so lay off a little for Christ 's sake
She 's grown up some has n't she
Yeah
While you went off for a few beers with your friends Is that Hettie Rodgers there with whatzizname
Where is she now Is she in the truck with your friends
Me and Jill we just had a little spat She felt kind of left out I guess from not knowing some of the new kids
Where 's Jill
Lillian
From Boston Evan Twombley 's son-in law he was driving I know where they 're headed Up the lake Agaway The old man 's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt so they probably got some big weekend party planned
I still do n't understand
Mel Gordon
Good Who
I know who it is
Did you get his number
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW He could 've killed somebody
Are you okay Wade What was wrong Why were you holding everyone up
Do n't be silly Hi Jill
Do n't lie to me You 're leaving me I can see that
I 'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that 's built up For the rummage sale And some things for the cleaners And the laundromat
Going somewhere Margie
Look that 's temporary believe me There 's so much shit gon na hit the fan the next few days my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt wo n't matter a bit
I heard you talking You got fired this morning did n't you
It 's my tooth My fucking tooth I ca n't even think anymore because of it
What on earth is happening to you Why are you acting this way
Jesus Christ Pop let 's go home I got waylaid Sorry
What happened
Wade
This is nuts
I do n't know for Christ 's sake
How
Of course I would 've heard
Think they 're alright
Strange
The truck 's here Looks like they 've stayed inside since the snow started
Are you sure they 're home Did you call
I just want to pick up my divorce papers For the lawyer It wo n't take long
I know your parents
Do n't you think it 's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
Did you tell them That we were coming
Good
Alright I 'll think about it
It was to the same woman I was just a kid It 's not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought Something for you and me to talk about and think about You know
You 've been married twice
I 've been thinking about it that 's all
Oh Wade
There 's another thing I 've been thinking about I do n't know how you feel about the idea Margie because we 've never talked about it But I 've been thinking lately I 've been thinking we should get married sometime You and me
Then I guess you have to
I 'm her father supposed to be but I 'm not able to Yes Yes I am It may be the only thing in my life I 've been so clear about wanting Even if it takes a big fight
Do n't you think do you still think it 's a good idea to press this custody thing just now
It 's nice
After making love I like it It 's nice to see that in a grown-up person
What way
Yeah but never what you looked like Not really Never really studied your face like now I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way
You knew me as a kid
I can see what you looked like as a kid
But not now
No Not for money But if somebody 'd given me half a damned excuse I was pretty fucked up you know
You would n't have done anything like that shot someone for money
No I just know Jack 's lying about what happened He just seemed I know that kid what he 's like inside He 's a lot like I was at his age
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt
Lots of people Guy like Evan Twombley Boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead The Government 's been investigating his links with the Mafia
Jack would n't kill for it Besides who would pay him
Everybody needs money Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his People like that
Jack does n't need money
Money
Wade How can you even think such a thing Why would Jack Hewitt do that shoot Twombley on purpose
I 've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley instead of Twombley shooting himself I 've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose
Jack 's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry He used to be a sweet kid but it 's like when he found out he could n't play ball anymore he changed Now he 's like everyone else
I 'm sure I 'm positive it did n't happen the way Jack says it did
I heard he was drunk at Toby 's last night and got in a fight with Hettie He drove off without her
There 's something funny about that shooting There 's lots funny about it actually
Jack 's sort of sensitive I guess More than most But he 'll be okay in a few weeks
Okay
Tonight Let 's get together
Call me
The hell she is n't Lillian 's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her I 'm gon na hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing this divorce thing rearranged I 've been thinking about it a lot It 's like she owns Jill or something Nobody owns nobody especially not kids And I pay her
No you do n't You 're pissed that 's all You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian You know Work it out with her tell her how you feel Lillian 's not out to get you
Yeah I mean that
You do n't mean that
I 'm going to start one of those custody suits I do n't give a fucking shit You know

Take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things Call Chub Merritt get your car back call a dentist for God 's sake and get your tooth pulled do n't trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police Let them work on this
To help Jack of course and to nail those sonsofbitches the Two Gordons That 's what Alma calls them Jesus Rolfe whose side are you on
For what
I know what it means I 'm just running out of ways to use it
But you got ta hear this You wo n't believe it Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I 'm in his office
Wade are you alright
Then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you do n't know who the hell it belongs to Strange It 's the business with the old man I know and how incredibly pissed I was at him and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that and the Goddamned truck going through the ice not to mention Margie 's being so upset one thing on top of another
That 's what you think
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop I was a careful child and I became a careful adult but at least I was n't afflicted by that man 's violence
Well I never heard that one
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
We 'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him
It was n't me I was n't there but I heard about it When I heard about it it was about Elbourne
You think I would n't remember a thing like that
It may have happened but not the way you said
Of course it happened Why would I lie about it
I hate to disappoint you but I do n't think it happened
Yeah
I was thinking about that story you told me about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after
I care about what happened The truth I 'm a student of history remember
Right 's right goddamnit Do n't you care what 's right
Not particularly
It 's too neat Things ai n't that neat It makes me mad That somebody can pay to kill somebody his own father-in-law and not be punished for it Do n't that piss you off
Shit around here you shoot somebody in the woods you say it was an accident you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted Jack 's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ai n't got his deer yet and do n't want his license pulled
A hunting accident is perfect
So Mel Gordon would n't want a professional hit That 'd make the feds dig deeper He wants an accident
Here 's my theory Twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out Finds out his son-in-law is involved
Yeah the guy with the BMW I told you about I did did n't I
Okay It 's likely there are people in the union who do n't want Twombley to testify They probably include his son-in-law who 's vice-president and will probably be the next president I read that in the papers What 's his name Mel Gordon
I do n't know You tell me
They would n't deal with a guy like Jack Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead
Who 'd pay him that kind of money Not the mob They got their own guys Specialists
Money
Motive You got ta have a motive
Well your friend I think Jack Hewitt
Then who shot him
That it was n't an accident
Which is
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one
Find them everywhere
Want to know what I think happened
I guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
Anything new about the shooting Twombley
I want to let the gas run out I do n't want the bastard driving drunk and he 's always drunk now After we 'll hide the keys
Yeah She 'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop We ca n't leave him alone here he 'll set the damn place on fire With Jill here a lot it 'll be good to have Margie around Things are going to change in that department by the way I got a custody lawyer in Concord I 'm gon na see him tomorrow All hell 's gon na break loose but it 's worth it
Well do you still plan to get married
What about her
What about Margie
Yeah I forgot
No thanks I do n't drink
Anyone else want one Rolfe
What about Jill Is Lillian bringing her
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do I guess
No no I have n't Not really I 've growled a little but I have n't bit
Have n't you already done a bit of that
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days Rolfe and some night I 'm going to bite back I swear it
Get some sleep
Yeah I guess
Do n't think about it You 're exhausted
A divorce lawyer A custody lawyer You know 'cause of Jill
What happened
Jill I was thinking of getting a lawyer Maybe you can help me
Who
Picked up Jill She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween She wanted to go home
How was she
The night before the shooting
Huh
Lillian was here In Lawford
They were out deer hunting right Jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body
Well it was an accident
You think Jack shot him
No shit
Twombley
Who
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business
It 'll come out Jack lied and the kid 'll get hung for it
No not tonight I 'm in bed too I 'm calling because I need you to listen You 're supposed to be a smart guy You 're a professor I got this theory Jack says he did n't see Twombley shot but he did
Wade it 's late I know you 're probably at Toby 's but I 'm in bed reading We got different habits
Yeah I know him the kid that was with him Maybe you do too Jack Hewitt He works for LaRiviere with me He 's my best friend
There was something It happened up your way
Yeah brother look I was calling cause has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley Evan Twombley
Wade
Rolfe
Jim for godsake
Daddy Daddy please
I 'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier
Yes dear
Mom
Big secret You said the same thing to Newsweek
You 're right and I 'll tell you a secret I know exactly how you feel
That 's not really the point
Some kids were teasing you
I know But lotsa times I feel like it 's me versus the world Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh I mean it does n't take a genius to figure which is more important
Your father never means to be so
When I write my memoirs I think I 'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One
No it 's okay After all he is the President right
I 'm sorry honey
He 's in a meeting He ca n't be disturbed
I know Mom It was great really
We 'll talk at home You know most girls are n't as lucky as you For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime
Back at The Fishbowl
You 're jet-lagged We 'll talk about this back
Mom just this once give it a rest
Alice
Hey Joey how bout a cocoa double whip cream
Do n't you even want to ask
I 'm sure he 's busy
You do n't want to say hi to your father
Yeah no duh
Well you are n't the President dear
It 's not like he has n't made us wait a few times
You are a resilient man Mr
He did n't leave us
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality
Fuck off you stupid asshole
That 's the way of the world little one Did n't they teach you that in school
The woman you shot She was my friend
Yeah Do you know what the word quot asshole quot means
Smart for your age eh Top of your class Tell me do you know what the word quot propaganda quot means
Yeah I study world events Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch 's cleansings along with 15 American school kids You know hQw I studied that I went to their funerals with my dad I met their parents
So you study world events little one That 's good for a girl your age
You 're one of Stravanavitch 's men
No thank you The gunfire did that
You must be tired It 'll wake you up
I do n't drink coffee
Okay I 'm slowing us down
There they are
It 's okay honey I got you I got you You 're okay
Oh NY god oh my god oh my god

How was the ballet
Hey you guys back already
Oooooh I 'm good
Warn then again If they do n't respond shoot them down We will not be intimidated
SOLDIER The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner
SOLDIER They are in our airspace We would be within our rights
It 's some kind of trick a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement
SOLDIER Yes They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails
Did we warn them off
SOLDIER The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747
MECHANIC cross it The static overwhelms the voice then cuts out
It 's cut
MECHANIC Okay you 're aerated To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump There 's no switch in Avionics so you 'll have to cross the wires There should be five wires just to your left Do you see them
Okay it 's on We 've got some indicator lights here
MECHANIC Pop it open There should be a red switch toggle it up
Got it
MECHANIC Do you see the maintenance panel
CARLTON Uh Tower we got a problem up here
Sluggish I think it 's jammed too
CARLTON Aw man You 're torn up pretty bad out here sir Do you have any elevater control
CARLTON Lem me take a look
No We 're losing fuel and my rudder 's not responding
CARLTON Just stay on my wing sir I 'll take you all the way in

CARLTON Who 's flying the fucking plane
He 's busy being dead
CARLTON Put your pilot on
You read my mind
CARLTON Mr President it 's an honor Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here
CARLTON Copy Air Force One Welcome to the party
U.S Pilots this is Air Force One
NORTHWOOD That 's game set and match There 's nothing to do except call the Chief Justice
I prefered the terrorists
NORTHWOOD They 've got no chutes They ca n't control the plane their engines are failing and they 're losing fuel
This does n't make sense
NORTHWOOD They are n't answering their hails
That kid 's name was Jim Marshall
NORTHWOOD Walter if you have a point make it
NORTHWOOD Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you 're making demands
We do n't know that
NORTHWOOD He 's dead then They must have killed him
An exercise in futility Send the Nimitz back in
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it 's just an exercise
Put together a score sheet I 'll make some calls
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders is n't as popular as we thought it 'd be Representative Taylor is working on a compromise
Thanks Wrote it last night
It was a good ad-lib sir
Goddamn right I did I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit What 's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib
Sir you threw out page two
NORTHWOOD To swear you in as President
CHANDLER The Chief Justice What on earth for
CHANDLER If fired upon tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage
NORTHWOOD Iraqi 's wo n't buy it Either they 're already in on this or they 'll think we 're spying
CHANDLER If challenged our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission
NORTHWOOD Like any good poker player they 're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard
CHANDLER They still have the President it 's past their deadline and they have n't called What do you think it means
CHANDLER Okay Also I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike
NORTHWOOD I hate to be pragmatic but they 'll sacrifice pawns before kings It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff
CHANDLER But they start executing hostages in
NORTHWOOD We 've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace
CHANDLER Can we do that
CHANDLER Does your office have anything to add Mr Dean
NORTHWOOD General Greely says it looks like the Middle East
My loyalty was never to my country
You 're duty to what The country you served does n't exist anymore
Because it is my duty
Why
Yes Mr President
Special Agent Gibbs You helped do this
PILOT Ga get it
That 's affirmative
Roger
PILOT Air Force One please reduce speed to 250 knots
Air Force One acknowledged tNT EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP
PILOT Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet Over
About goddamn time
PILOT Air Force One this is AF-135-RA We have been instructed to refuel your plane
No If we land this plane anywhere else we will end up another Entebe The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud evades missiles and refuels in mid-air Call the White House
Over the Black Sea I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia
Where are we now
Not even close Hell we ca n't even make Syria or Iraq
We 're not going to make it
We 've stopped dumping but we 've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left
Go Take Serge and watch your backs
Avionics compartment It 's the only place You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless of course you 'd rather be a martyr than a savior
How
Well it worked
Psychology They 're trying to unnerve us
why did they do that
Remarkable aircraft Remarkable
A secret service agent It must be
We checked the manifest Everyone was accounted for
Who did this
Any of us

How many others killed
Dead
The rest of the secret service

Very good Thank you Ms Mitchell
You 're pointing a gun at me
Scared We 're scared
How are your fellow hostages feeling Ms Mitchell
I 'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office
And what is it you do Ms Mitchell
Maria Maria Mitchell
Please tell me your name
Thank you
Here 's a press kit I 'll let you guys get comfortable and once we 're airborne I 'll be able to schedule the interviews
Conference rooms though some have other functions The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center
And all these rooms here
I guess it depends on your perspective
A dubious distinction no
You do n't know the half of it Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary
This is a remarkable aircraft
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center The MCC as we call it can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth We 're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you Now if you 're all cleared You can follow me then
Ms Mitchell So nice to finally meet you in person
You 're very valuable And our nation needs so many things
You got what you wanted You going to release us now
Three
Jim
Four
Please You can kill me but leave my daughter alone
The world is such a dangerous place and we ca n't always protect our children
You will be the first to pay for that mistake
Nor will there be My husband does not negotiate with terrorists
Say something dear
No
Shall I begin by executing the President 's daughter She 's right here
So is this Come now you 're upsetting the little one
That was war
But they are not ny people You look at me as if I am a monster but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who 's faces You will never see Did You cry for their wives and children They were people too yes but they were not your people
How can you I mean they 're people
I neither enjoy nor dislike I do what is necessary
Why Do you enjoy it
Yes
Do you have to be so brutal
Your husband is a coward He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night
My husband is a very courageous man
I know he left you behind
What do you know of my husband
Or you will do what Mrs Marshall But I admire your courage Your husband on the other hand
Leave my daughter alone
Come on Alice
Now or he dies please
Cooperation If you try to escape you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade 's bodies will prevent you from exiting Good day
What do you want with us
Fear will keep you alive Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish and bound to die
Hold on Alice
No you wo n't You 'll compromise like always
If you put down the gun I promise not to drop her on the way down
Let my daughter go or I 'll take you out
There goes your ride
One thing I 've learned as
The taste of defeat is bitter no
You do n't like seeing people get hurt Now in morality that is a virtue In politics however that is weakness You were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to
Someday you 'll regret my nature
Good Good
Yes I 'll do it Just leave my family alone
You 'll do it
Stop
Pity Mr Gibbs
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch S release
She is n't a part of this This is between you and me
No But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill perhaps I will start with your family instead Gibbs
Over my dead body
Now since we 've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate I wondered if you would be so kind
CHANDLER I 'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement Land the plane and we 'll trade you hostages for fuel
Finally we can bargain
CHANDLER Yes You 've made yourself quite clear
Madame Vice president We have an options paper chandler takes the options paper waves off Lee and reads it as she talks
CHANDLER You heard me You Congress and cabinet heads
Twenty minutes
CHANDLER Okay Gentlemen we 'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane Lee go huddle with the D.O.D I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground Our hands are completely tied while they 're in the air
That is n't necessary
CALDWELL Sir we stay with the President
CALDWELL Yes sir
I 'll not going without my family
Got it
CALDWELL Eighteen thousand feet sir And two hundred knots otherwise it 's suicide
Get em ready You come with me
They 've cut communication and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives My only solution ran out of batteries
CALDWELL We ca n't jump from here or at this speed But if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane
We 've already played our cards Major There 's no turning back
CALDWELL Gravity
Mr Caidwell the ground 's a few miles away How do you propose getting us from here to there
Tell our boys to cool their jets I do n't need em creating policy for me
CALDWELL The northern border 's gotten a bit hairy Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage
They 've got ta be joking
CALDWELL Our KH-ll 's took this one at 0100 hours What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades
You have n't even driven a car since you took office
Flying the plane
What are you doing
Both of you
Call Petrov I 'll be back
Please do n't start with me
I do n't know why you stayed
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in
Look on the bright side hon Shep here thinks I 'll be a one termer
Well they are n't burning me in effigy That 's always a good sign
How did your speech go
This promise is n't subject to Congressional approval
I should trust that promise Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut
I 'll make it up to you I promise
I wish it were that easy
But that 's the point Jim We 're right here
I miss you And I miss her
What
You know what
And when have I had five minutes When I wake up in the morning and I 'm already three hours behind Schedule What do you want me to do Rose tell the G7 to fuck off because I 'm a family man
How do you know she understands You have n't spent more than five minutes with her or me in weeks
She 's a big girl She understands
For godsakes Jim slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy Not even you can plug all the world 's leaks Do n't you think it 's a sign you 're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person
Rose I do n't have time for this
Do n't I know spin control when I feel it
No Mr President It ca n't
Ca n't it wait
May I speak to you for a moment
Actually sir you could be that someone
Someone should give you a raise
White House Situation room
Where are we sending it
No I thought about this Mr
No good I said they disabled the communications system
The fax machines
Excuse me
The fax machines
Freeing Stravanavitch is gon na get tens of thousands killed I ca n't live with that I 'm not royalty I 'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office We do n't negotitate Not as long as I 'm President Is that understood
CHANDLER Please Mr President You 're going to get yourself killed Is that your solution
CHANDLER But this is different sir You 're the President
You know my policy We do n't negotiate with terrorists If we start now all of America becomes a target
CHANDLER and if that means negotiating
Then tell me there 's a rescue operation underway
CHANDLER They 're still alive but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes
Did they say anything about my family

We 'll just say it was in bad taste
I said it 's not worth the fight Steward please
Did we tape the Duke game
Sir the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television You ca n't afford to leave that hanging
It 's bait Do n't take it
Right Christ I 'm tired Do me a favor and keep me away from the press
Other way around sir
This is a crime bill Shep Killing a couple ducks wo n't get it through committee Besides Shep I told you I do n't shoot babies and I do n't kiss guns
We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge The second amendment types 'll love that
I might still have a few chips left
With all due respect sir maybe you should give them this one Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch
He and the NRA do n't like the wording
No no I 'm fine What did the Speaker say
You wan na knock of f
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy
CBS said they 'll give us four minutes They thought the Russian was a nice touch
Commissioner Aquarius
Kruger Sagittarius
I was asking McCrosky Commissioner
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor
What 's the story
I was reading too
Forget it I was reading
You 've made your point Commissioner There 's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that 's Clarence Oveur He 's got a lunar flight today I want him pulled Jacobs pull Oveur
I told you leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one
That just does n't make any sense
That 's right Commissioner Senselessly murdered just minutes ago
I just wish it was that simple
What
Commissioner
You handle your front office people I 'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board
Bud get wise to the political realities The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown
And what do the boys on the board know about safety Commissioner Let u me u talk to them
Forget it The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule
Commissioner we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing
Um Do you people scream right when you you know
What is it Mary
Yes it did Mr Dunn can I ask you a personal question
Felt like a large asteroid
Yes I did
Did you feel that
You better take this
Sir
Dunn
You better check on it Mr Dunn I 'll stay here and fly the ship
Sir I 've got an overload in disposal unit four
You better check it Unger
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four sir
Accelerators down
Shut down accelerators
Dunn
Oveur
Kramer the WORP control handle just came off in my hand
Ted the lever
Compute
Now
Set
We 've blown the computer Elaine Set course change
I guess you 'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this
Not when I 'm with you Ted
Are you afraid
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds He 'll roast like a pig on a spit
What will happen to him Ted
That 's right premature ejection
You mean
Sit down Elaine If this bomb trick works we just might make it Simon was a fool to eject now
Simon just ejected
That might be the news we 've been waiting for
I just want you to know I love you Ted and always will
Well Elaine this might be it if those guys on the ground do n't think of something
That was very well put Ted
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place You people knew this ship was n't ready to fly You played God with over a hundred lives Kruger and for what the prestige of your precious space program
I mean until we start to burn up
Not now Elaine
Ted we 've only got ten minutes
Ted please be careful
Elaine I 'm going back there Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can
Ted there 's no time to explain
Elaine what 's going on
Ted
Elaine
Ted a toilet 's not going to kill anyone
There 's something dangerously wrong with this ship Elaine I know its the wiring That toilet 's just the tip of the iceberg
I 'd use the word insane
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face
The word is sick Ted very very very sick
What word would you use Elaine
I 've never used the word insane Ted
Then you u do u think I 'm insane
Ted get a grip on yourself You should never have left the hospital
Elaine I mean the mission has to be aborted This ship should never have passed FSA inspection This thing is held together by string and chewing gum
We ca n't go back We had something very special but it 's all over
Elaine we have to go back
Ted I do n't know why you got on this flight I do n't know what you 're trying to prove
Elaine
Ted
Not now Elaine
Ted
I 've got it Elaine I 've figured out what 's wrong with the shuttle
What are you doing Ted
Let me by Elaine
Ted we 're taking off
I have to get in there I have to stop this flight
Ted What are you
Goodbye Ted I do n't want to hurt you
That 's the way I want it Just turn the radio on and go
If that 's the way you want it
No goodbyes Elaine Just go
Ted you must remember what the doctor said the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you 're sick Now take your electro-shock and you 'll be back at the space center in no time And by the way Ted I 'm leaving you for Simon
His name 's David Stockman He 's been here twenty years that 's all he says
And when are you going to realize Ted that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now
Elaine when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way
Sammy Davis Junior Terrible car accident He has n't been the same since
Who 's that Ted
Eat this spaghetti Ted It 'll make you feel a lot better
Ted I loved you and I 'll always love you But I need Simon He 's stable He 's a good provider I want that at this stage of the game Ted He might have his faults but Simon does n't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man
Elaine what happened to us
Ted please You 're just making things difficult for yourself
Elaine
You 're as bad as the rest of them Elaine It 's all here in the design specifications Look It 's all here
Let 's relax tonight just the two of us I 'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it with spaghetti
There 's nothing wrong with me
Ted you 're overworked You 've been flying yourself into the ground
Ask Simon
Ted what 's wrong
I mean the Mercury flight It 's not safe and Kurtz you know why
But Ted the invitations have already gone out
It 's got to be stopped
That 's not important now Elaine We have to talk
Te
Elaine
Yes last week that pile of mud was only this high
Is he making any progress Doctor
The brain is an amazingly complex organ Elaine
Is that a good sign Doctor
You can be gentle with him Elaine He 's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden
I mean for Ted
You can eat balanced meals exercise and take Geritol
What can u I u do Doctor Rumack
So you see our task is n't made any easier by Ted 's refusal to admit that he 's sick
The human brain is a highly complex organ Elaine perhaps the most complex next to the bladder Let me show you Ted 's problem is in this area This area this area here here here under here here
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon Doctor
Simon what are you saying
Maybe
Simon I did n't want it to end like this We can be friends You 'll die out there
Your career What about the lives of those people out there Simon what happened to the man I thought I loved
My career is shot
We 're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down
Ca n't we change course
He tried to disconnect ROK It gassed him That computer is running this ship and we 're heading right for the sun
Simon what 's happening
Roger
Simon I 'm going to check ROK 's secondary readout unit
That 's my girl
I think so
Have you got it straightened out now
Do n't be too long
Meet me onboard sweetheart I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore
So mentally ill
Simon why has he become so so
Elaine Ted 's a danger to himself he 's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East
No I 've been excited before
I guess this is a first for you
I 'm so excited Simon
Frank 's the best pilot in the program
You 're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr and Mrs Simon Kurtz
But darling they 've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe
Women u and u the space program have come a long way sweetheart But after the wedding no more complicated computers for my little girl
And I can hardly believe that I 'm engaged to someone like you Simon I 'm a very lucky woman
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run
Simon
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission
Roger You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit
No I mean you can do it from the cockpit
I 'd rather sit down for this one Elaine
You can do it from up here Captain
Roger
We have to disconnect ROK 's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system
I see What do you think our alternatives are
I do n't think we have any alternative Captain
Yes sir
Elaine ask ROK for a field interference scan Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications
There 's nothing wrong with me Elaine What about tonight just you and me We can be alone I can get rid of everyone else on the ship I 've already proven u that u
Request self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes
Life support check Elaine it 's obvious you 've been ignoring me You 're a woman I can relate to that
Request life support systems check
Systems check positive Look Elaine I
Request comprehensive electrical systems check
You have great tits
Go ahead
Can I say something of a personal nature to you
That 's okay ROK
Elaine I 'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit Elaine I know where I 'm coming from on this
That 's not possible
Negative
That does n't make sense Repeat analysis
Negative
Intermitant failure in scan mode R Analyze
Look a man can make an honest mistake Anyway she was asking for it They 're all asking for it all the time
No more kids yelling 'Your old man 's a thieving rapist
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet

Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury Dad
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us
We 'll have to check Jimmy It 's a pretty long trip to Mercury
Will Scraps be able to sit with us Dad

Take this Joey It 's my last few bucks You 'll need a hot meal when you get there

You 're sure
That 's right Joe Now no one 's going to hurt you and no one has to know what 's wrong with you

What should I say
No a bomb Now as discreetly as possible I want you to move the passengers into the lounge
A b
He 's carrying a bomb
Sixteen C why
Which passenger is Joe Salucci
Yes sir commander This is Mercury One Everything seems A okay up here and ready for count-down
Whenever your 're ready Captain
Captain Oveur your navigator Mr Unger and your first officer Mr Dunn
Good to be aboard gentlemen
Do you think it 's necessary to explain u everything u
That 's how dry cleaning works Now I 'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians
We do n't have much time Let 's move I 'll explain everything
Mr Kurtz I presume
Captain Oveur
Now he 's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury
Ah yes the Institute I 'm familiar with it
Let 's go Daddy We have to check in He was never appreciated at the Institute
It 's a privilege to meet you sir I 'm familiar with all your work
Yes
Say is n't that Dr Barrington the world renowned agronomist
Thanks but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays
You folks need any help
But that 's not a door The door 's over there
Do n't try to stop me
You ca n't go in there
Death death How about the first Thursday in March ten o'clock
All right it 's a matter of death
You 'll have to be more specific than that sir
No dammit It 's a matter of life or death
Do you have an appointment sir
I have to see Bud Kruger
Pull yourself together We 've got to
Do n't talk to me about Elaine Outta my way
Then Elaine was right
That damn computer has taken over I 'm getting out
Kurtz you 're drunk Who 's in command of this ship
Striker
I know you 've been subtly spreading the word that I 'm having a breakdown
You 're tired Striker overworked That wiring meets all the safety specifications
Look at this wiring It 's shorting out under high temperatures
You 're seeing bugs where they do n't exist Striker
That 's right Striker And we 're getting married when we return
Are you on the Mercury mission
Well we laughed We laughed all the time
No It 's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father 's dying
I just wish it was that simple We really were in love You know how it is when you laugh all the time
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there 's change in the two people who share that love
Sure But that 's only when the love itself goes unchanged
Not if the people change together in relation to that love
People change in relation to each other Love changes on its own
Love 's the same as it always was It 's people who change
We were in love but I 'm not sure I know what love is anymore
No I mean your relationship
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
Do you want to talk about it
No I mean your head Sit down I 'll take a look at it I 'm a nurse
I 'm getting over it If a relationship is n't working you ca n't force it
You 've been hurt
You do n't have to excuse yourself I 'm a nurse I understand
I 'm familiar with your work Doctor You 'll have to excuse me I have to go
Yes He 's dying u a-n-d u wants to be buried on Mercury
Not Dr Barrington the world renowned agronomist
You do n't have to thank me I 'm a nurse This is my father Dr Barrington
Uh oh thank you It 's nothing
Excuse me are you alright I noticed you talking to yourself I 'm a nurse Can I be of some help
That 's a very nice compliment and I 'd like to say that you 've done the same for me
Just in case I do n't have a chance to say goodbye I want you to know that I have n't spent so many pleasant hours for many years
No I 'm all alone
I 'm sure we 'll both make it but just in case one of us well is there a message you 'd like me to give someone
That 's a lovely name Mine 's Milton Milt Ettenhenim But my friends call me 'Bubbles
Mine 's Eleanor Eleanor Schiff
You know here we are having coffee together and discussing education and business and economy and we do n't even know each other 's names full names I mean
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that 's the reason The truth of the matter is nobody ever asked me
I know the answer Career A smart woman like you became so involved in your work you did n't have time for marriage
Well I 'm afraid that 's a question that 's all too easy to answer
But I think it 's time we stopped talking about me A woman like you why have n't you ever married
Well after a thing like that you would n't be expected to
After my wife died I felt like a fifth wheel You know so many years being with one person a very wonderful person makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair When Ethel passed away I was lost I could n't function socially and I could n't function in business
No I 'm from Washington D.C I 'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen 's Assocation
Well it really was n't a vacation You see I 'm a teacher in the New York City school system and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education Are you from L.A
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles
No thank you I take it black Like my men
Thank you Cream
Ah wo n't you sit down
That 's very nice of you Thank you
I happened to be passing and I thought you might like some corfee
KRAMER Shep no He gets so excited when new people are here
but after awhile you begin to get used to it
KRAMER Shep no I 'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there
Yeah something like that but as I say they did n't have time to tell me very much
KRAMER Something about a plane with no pilot
Well to tell the truth they really did n't fill me in on many of the details Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer
KRAMER Shep sit sit So I understand you 've got a real emergency down there
KRAMER Oh yes Come in Paul Rex will be right out
Hello I 'm Paul Carey from the airline I 'm here to pick up Captain Kramer
Excuse me Doc I 've got a plane to land
RUMACK And the last thing he said to me Doc he said Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all they 've got and win just one for the Zipper I do n't know where I 'll be then Doc he said but I wo n't smell too good That 's for sure
George Zipp said that
RUMACK I 'm doing everything I can And stop calling me Shirley
Surely there must be something you can do
RUMACK I wo n't deceive you Mister Striker We 're running out of time
Yes everything they 've got How are the passengers doing
RUMACK Will the hospital equipment be at the airport
Chicago the passengers are beginning to panic When do we start down
RUMACK safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment
Let 's see Those are the flaps that 's the thrust this must turn on the landing lights
RUMACK Elaine I have n't time to put this gently so I 'll be very direct Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation Mister Striker is the only hope we 've got
Well I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force but this plane has four engines It 's an entirely different kind of flying u all u u together u
RUMACK I u am u serious and do n't call me Shirley What flying experience have you had
Surely you ca n't be serious
RUMACK Can you fly this airplane and land it
Both pilots
RUMACK I 'm not sure I have n't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival
What is it Doctor What 's happening
No I mean we ca n't u land u for another two hours Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains We 've got to go through to Chicago
RUMACK You ca n't take a guess for another two hours
Well not for another two hours
RUMACK Ca n't you take a guess
I ca n't tell
RUMACK Captain how soon can we land
RUMACK I think you ought to know what our chances are The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane but who did n't have fish for dinner
No No one that I know of
Well
RUMACK All right Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly I ca n't even be sure of saving their lives Now is there anyone else on board who can land this plane
No
RUMACK Elaine you 're a member of this crew Can you face some unpleasant facts
RUMACK Extremely serious It starts with a slight fever
Just how serious is it doctor
He had fish too
RUMACK Let 's see now The co-pilot had fish What did the navigator eat
Doctor Rumack Mister Hammen ate fish And Randy says there are five more cases and they ate fish too
He had fish
RUMACK What did he have
RUMACK Yes yes I remember I had lasagna
Well we had a choice Steak or fish
RUMACK What was it we had for dinner tonight
Certainly
RUMACK It 's a big building with patients But that 's not important right now Tell the Captain I must speak to him
A hospital What is it
RUMACK You 'd better tell the Captain We 've got to land as soon as we can This woman has to be gotten to a hospital
RUMACK Yes Yes of course
We have some passengers who are very sick Could you come and take a look at them
RUMACK That 's right
Sir Excuse me sir I 'm sorry to have to wake you Are you a doctor
Uh-huh
See them Elaine
The gear is down
Tell them the gear is down and we 're ready to land
I wanted you to know now I 'm very proud
Yes
Ted
I do n't care I just do n't have what it takes They 'd be better off with someone who 'd never flown before
But Ted you 're the only
Oil pressure I forgot to check the oil pressure When Kramer hears about this the shit 's gon na hit the fan
What happened Ted What went wrong
Rats I 've lost number three
It 's a damn good thing you do n't know how much he hates your guts
It 's a damn good thing he does n't know how much I hate his guts
Sluggish Like a wet sponge
Sluggish Like a wet sponge
And a little ice
And a little ice
Rain
That 's what I 've been trying to tell these people
Ted What are you doing You ca n't fly this plane
A lot of people made plans before the war Like George Zipp
Ted I do n't want to stay here It 's time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war
I think they 're getting the hang of it When we re-enlist I 'll teach them baseball
That 's Lieutennt Hurwitz Severe shell shock He thinks he 's Ethel Merman
What 's his problem
Be patient Ted No one expects you to get over this immediately
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp
Seven Lieutenant Zipp died this morning Ted Doctor Sandler says you 'll be out in a week Is n't that wonderful
Is it Because of my mistake six men did n't return from that raid
It 's a big building where the generals meet But that 's not important right now They 've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid Is n't that good news
Headquarters What is it
You got a telegram from head­quarters today
But it wo n't be Not as long as you insist on living in the past
That 's the way I 've always wanted it to be Elaine
Mostly I remember the nights when we were together I remember how you used to hold me and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle and then afterwards how we 'd watch until the sun came up When it did it was almost like like each new day was created only for us
I remember everything All I have are memories
Elaine just hear me out I know things have n't been right for a long time But it will be different like it was in the beginning Remember
I love you
I love you Elaine
Oh Ted please be careful I worry about you so much
My orders came through My squadron ships out tomorrow I 'll be leading a very important mission
What 's the matter
You you should n't have come I do n't have time now
Elaine I 've got to talk to you
Ted what are you doing here
It 's too late Ted When I get back to Chicago I 'm going to start my life all over again I 'm sorry
But if you 'll just give me
It 's the truth What 's hurt you the most is your record since the war Different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility
You expect me to believe that
Your u war u u record u You 're the only one keeping that alive For everyone else it 's ancient history
You know I have n't been able to get near an airplane since the war And even if I could they would n't hire me because of my war record
Then why do n't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing
Elaine not yet I promise you I really can change
I wo n't be back I 've requested the Atlanta run
Look you 'll be back in town tomorrow night We 'll have dinner talk it over
It takes so many things to make love last Most of all it takes respect And I ca n't live with a man I do n't respect
Do n't you feel anything for me at all any more
I have been patient and I 've tried to help but you would n't even let me do that
I know things have n't been right for a long time but it 'll be different If you 'll just be patient I can work things out
I just do n't want to go over it any more
I came home early and found your note I guess you meant for me to read it later Elaine I 've got to talk to you
Ted
Elaine
Find out if there 's a doctor on board as quietly as you can
I think so but I 've never seen it so acute
Airsick
Who wants to be first
Hey we 've been waiting for you A little bit late tonight
Joey can stay up here for a while if he 'd like to
We 'd better get back now
Hello
We have a visitor
Good-bye darling
Good-bye darling I love you I love you darling
Good-bye darling
Bill Bill Good-bye Bill
So long darling Good-bye Take care of yourself
Oh Bill I 'll keep it I 'll keep it with me all the time
Good-bye darling
Every day
You promise you 'll write
Oh Bill I 'm going to miss you so much
All right he 's on final now Put out all runway lights except niner
He 's right on the heading
Watch your altitude Striker It 's too erratic You ca n't come straight in You 've got enough fuel left for two hours flying You 've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather
He 's all over the place Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet What an asshole
You are now eight miles from the airport Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet
Eight miles Turn right to heading zero eight niner
Runway niner It 's the longest and directly into the wind
Did you decide on a runway yet
Yes Captain
And get that finger out of your ear You do n't know where that finger 's been Gunderson
Here
Oh Jack I 'm so warm I 'm burning up
How ya doing honey
What is it
Oh I ca n't stand it
Well it was n't all that I had hoped
What did you think of 'Great Expectations
Yeah I think he is Hey Fred
Jack is n't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck Maybe he 's on our flight to Chicago
The hell I do n't I 'm out there busting my buns every night
and that you do n't really try except during the playoffs
We are turning left to a heading of zero niner-niner
and that lots of times you do n't even run down court
Denver Control this is Flight two-zero niner intersecting Victor Airway seven niner-niner
I think you 're the greatest But my Dad says you do n't work hard enough on defense
I 'm an airline pilot Ah Clarence according to my calculations with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies
I think you should go back to your seat now Joey Right Clarence
You u are u Kareem I 've seen you play My Dad 's got season tickets
I 'm sorry son but you must have me confused with someone else My name is Roger Murdock I 'm the co-pilot
Wait a minute I know you You 're Kareem Abdul Jabbar You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers
Okay this is one of my favorites
Oh I 'd love to
I thought maybe you 'd like to hear a song
I 'm Lisa Oh you have a guitar
I 'm Randy
Hi
Oh it 's nothing to be alarmed about We 'll get back to you very quickly
HAMMEN Yes of course We both had fish Why
Well the doctor will be with you in just a moment One thing do you know what he had for dinner
HAMMEN Oh Stewardess My husband is very sick Can you do something please
Yes
HAMMEN I will but Jim wo n't
Would either of you like another cup of coffee
All right But just remember my name is Roger Murdock

Roger Roger What 's our vector Victor

ANGELINA Oh yes I saw Poor child
There 's a little girl on board who 's ill and
ANGELINA Yes
Excuse me Sister
Thank you Randy You better leave sweetheart You might get hurt in here
Mr Striker the passengers are ready
Would you go up please
Well I flew in the war but that was a long time ago I would n't know anything about it
It 's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit But that 's not important right now The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio Do you know anything about planes
The cockpit What is it
Excuse me sir There 's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering
No No thank you
Excuse me sir Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner
Oh I have n't flown for a long time
Do you feel all right sir
Thank you
Fourteen-B It 's halfway down on your right
Yeah
You okay
Your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes
I like my horizons narrow
I think you 're just a little scared now about what you might find once the lights go out A little scared and a lot curious Maybe more than you want to admit But does n't that turn you on that curiosity and fear swirling together Think of it as broadening your horizons
There 's lots of things I have n't done but his ai n't high on the list Do n't take it personally
A virgin I find that very arousing
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later
I know Why do n't you hang around for a while let me entertain you It 's Matt right Now tell me the truth have you ever made it with one of us
Todd Todd does n't know either
The girl out front mentioned Strader 's assistant somebody named Watson Maybe he knows
Look I do n't know where Mr Strader might be He comes and he goes
You 've got me all wrong I do n't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable
Does that cost extra or you throw them in
Oooh Hardball That sounds interesting Are you going to strike me You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me I 've got my own ropes
Show me
In there
She did did she Well she was wrong Excuse me I have to change
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is
He 's not here Why ask me
Ss'ai k'ss Perfect
We are with the Police Department This is Sergeant Sykes and I am
That 's right
You are Cassandra
I may be an asshole but at least I 'm a real detective not some outer shit space thing
Lay off asshole
Well if it is n't Detective Jetson Forget you hip waders big guy
I 'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid Fedorchuk see how much surfin you 'd do
Look at your dildo partner He 's too scared to even come down to the sand You 're not gon na get wet standing here moron
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes
You do n't have squat
Jesus Sykes it 's been less than ten hours Me and Alterez are on it okay
So what 've you got on Tuggle 's killers
No Sergeant not history Eternity
Move a finger Harcourt and you 're history
That 's right He and I along with seven or eight others Listen gentlemen I will be happy to assist you in any way I can unfortunately at the moment I 'm overdue at another function
You were partners with him on some Slag uh Newcomer real estate thing
Yes I heard about poor Warren Tragic
Sergeant Detective I was n't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet
I 'm Sergeant Sykes and this is Detective Jetson Los Angeles Police Department
Yes
William Harcourt
Do it
Here
Kill them both
This is getting out of hand I want you to deal with it Immediately
When we picked him up he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about Hubley
It is his new partner that I 'm worried about
He did n't recognize me
This is becoming a serious breach of security
That cop the human he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver
You look very good
How do I look
You understand that But how many others will
But there 's no more drug
Because because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up
We ca n't let him get away
I never thought I 'd say this but for once in my life I think I 'm willing to wait for back-up
Tell me about it
No he 's not Not if he overdosed on the drug Massive amounts trigger a a change Your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but it 's really a state of incubation When you emerge you 're
Harcourt is dead
It 's Harcourt
What is this
Do what George
No We must do this alone
There Go back Down that side street
What 's this about George I know that look
It 'd be for your own good I think you 'd be better off with a partner who 's a little more by the book Still I got ta tell you George for a quiet guy you 're sure hell on wheels once you get going I 'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective
With Harcourt and Kipling dead I assume you will be requesting reassignment now
Ss-ai
Shit
Fuck procedure

Why What 's the big goddamn deal
The fifty kilos Matthew I have to find it I ca n't let it get out on the street
George c'mon lighten up It 's a beauty of a case Do n't sweat it we got him by the short hairs He ai n't gon na make any more of the shit
Stay out of this Matthew Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall
George uh you 're gon na break his little chest bones
Where is the drug Where have they taken it
Uh George
No George you 're missing the point The drug is evidence We need to have the evidence ya know
If the drug is here we must destroy it
Okay George we got ta play this real smart
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan Porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug Hubley manufactured it at the refinery Strader through the nightclub established a distribution network And Harcourt
I must trust you Matthew I can not stop this without you
George look me in the eye George you do n't ever lie to me again
Your people do n't know about this part of out past And they ca n't know It would threaten our entire existence here
Jesus this is major Why did n't you tell me sooner Why 'd you hold out on me
No I am sure not That is why I am so concerned someone must now be producing it here But none of my people know how to make it The process was carefully guarded
Where did he get it Was there any of it on the ship
We all did
We You 've taken it
Like your cocaine I suppose The high lasts several hours We would receive small amounts of it as a reward for our labor
How potent
It is called ss'jabroka To us it is a potent narcotic
The hell it is n't when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist That Slag was on something and not sour milk either Am I right TELL ME What is it
No I can not involve you This is not your concern
No secrets goddammit You do n't hold back from me Whatever is going on you 're gon na tell me now
You must leave me alone on this
What 's this nothing shit It was n't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits and it 's not nothing now Do n't lie to me George you 're bad at it
and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart So what the hell 's the connection
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub
So we 've got three guys dead All Newcomers all killed the same way execution style
Nothing
What was that about
Thank you
It 's all right George It 's cool Just wait here all right I 'll be back in a coupla minutes
Stop the car
Come on you wo n't have to get near the water
Please I must get out here
Why
Stop the car
Come on let 's go dude Surf 's up
To the to the beach
Well let 's roll George
She 's very progressive I 'm certain she 's considering it
George she 's not gon na divorce you You mate for life remember
She 's going to divorce me
A man a human was wiring it to your car I did n't get a good look at him I must call my wife
Where 'd you get this
Yeah go home Get some sleep You do sleep do n't you
I 'm going home
Do n't count on me George I never had any ideals
I hope you can understand how special your world is how unique a people you humans are So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves
You humans are very curious to us You invite us to live among you in an atmosphere of equality we 've never known before You lay before us a beautiful green world full of freedoms and opportunities You give us ownership of our lives for the first time and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves to live by the rules rules that are n't made to keep one people subordinate to another but rules that exist to preserve equality You aspire to very high ideals here
No shit Holmes You 're only from another goddamn planet for chrissakes
There is so much our two peoples do n't understand about each other
Ta ss'trakyona
Your health
Sticking out of his ass yeah See that 's what makes it a joke There 's like a surprise and your mind fills in the funny picture Here 's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it 's a thermometer Nada huh
In the other man 's rectum
and so and so the doctor says If this is the thermometer then where 'd I leave the pen You 're not you do n't think that 's funny George work with me I always get a laugh with that one Look if the doctor 's got the thermometer in his hand then where 's his pen got ta be
Maybe not I do n't know I 'm not sure I 'm gon na go She does n't need her burn-out of a father there
Human children can be very beautiful Getting married Congratulations You will be taking Sunday off then
I appreciate your honesty George
Your home is quite disordered I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in
It 's like having an eleventh finger removed It hurts like hell but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place
We mate for life Divorce is a strange concept to us
Was Divorced
You are married
Yeah I know the routine
My wife She worries about me
So she keeps you on a pretty short leash does she
Through his ass Next time you see him tell him to call me unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes
I believe he is probably lying
When will Strader return
We were chasing you because you ran you dumb son-of-a-bitch
Todd Watson The assistant manager
Who is he
Yeah that 's it Say it slow
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na
And what was that one about my mother That was a good one
Ss'loka It means literally small but intelligent creature It loses much in the translation
So what was that other word for Human Slow ka
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked
I 'll bet Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two
This is mole It 's good
Which one is that Raw what
Three months We learn quickly We adapt It is our strength what we were bred for to adapt to hostile environments
I do n't think I could ever learn to read that shit How long did it take you to learn English
Yeah sure I knew that
If I may make a suggestion We have different weak spots than you do Next time a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect I think you were looking for
In the camps we were lodged four to a room The selection process was entirely random We did not get to stay with our friends or families
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him
From quarantine when my people first arrived here He and I were housed together
You know that guy
Stay back I 'm okay
Matthew you do n't have to
That 's very colorful But see now I 've got a problem I do n't seem to be getting much cooperation from you Porter So I guess we 're gon na have to take this little session down to my office ya know
Your mother mates out of season
Tell me
Screw me That ca n't be right
Screw you
I 'll handle it
But I
Back off George
Uh Matthew
Your name would n't happen to be Porter would it
At the end of the bar
Who said that
My partner is dead Because one of you bastards killed him then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown where he 's home and dry 'cause nobody sees nothing nobody says nothing
Agree to work with me You do n't like me you do n't like any of us You have nothing but contempt for us And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner
Why 'd I do what
Why did you do it
We 'd like to ask you about a business associate of your Warren Hubley
Rudyard Kipling No shit Listen we just need a minute of your time
He has not been home since that day But she told me where to find him
Did you talk to him
She did n't know him But she said her son might
Aw-right What about the other guy
A week ago two men came to see her husband After they left he was very frightened She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her It was Hubley
Did you learn anything
Mrs Porter is not taking her husband 's death well
Why the hell Great fine You talk to the wife
I believe I should interview the widow alone
So the Slag they 're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery I 'd say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible Okay next step I got ta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us My spouse 's brother is one
How the hell do you know that
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks
And still it fits
Well Yeah it 's rubber It stretches
And that fits
Get the picture
A rubber A condom You know Coney Island whitefish Men human men put them on their uh penises to protect against having babies You need this for anything
What is this
Should n't we examine their personal effects
Nothing
Nothing
What 's this What 's going on
Great Well I 'm sure glad that 's settled are n't you
Yes no it is not unreasonable Although I
Possibly Good Well would you be willing to accept the theory George that possibly by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other Does that sound unreasonable to you
Well yes quite possibly
Nothing 's wrong I just want to get something straight You agree that there 's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right
What is wrong
Well there 's a thing about partners about being somebody 's partner You do for each other And other people 's rules do n't mean shit It 's the rules set up between the two of you that 's all that counts Understand Okay Well my friend and partner was shot last night and I 'm after the shitbag that did it As my partner I 'm asking you to respect me and help me find him
Yes
Look you want to fit in here right You want to learn how to get along
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case The Captain said
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till but I do n't think that 's what they were there for I think we got us a couple a executions on our hands George
There was no wallet but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
Terrific A real pillar of the community Was Hubley missing anything when they found him Was he ripped off
Nice signal dickwad
Through the chest Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest
His body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of Central Avenue near downtown
Let 's talk Hubley
That is exactly so It is like your name Sykes I 'm sure it does n't bother you at all that it sounds like ss'ai k'ss two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium
Anyway what 's it matter to you if we think it 's funny right Whatta you care
Gesundheit You do n't mind if I stick to George do you
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa
Man somebody really hung one on you I 've heard some good ones for you guys Humphrey Bogart Harley Davidson I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you You were n't at the back of the line were you George
I am George
What 's that Look Jetson Get this straight in your head We 're not pals we 're not married and we ai n't gon na take long moonlight walks together We 're just partners And do n't call me Sergeant Call me Sykes or Matt if you have to
Sergeant I 'd like to thank you for what you 're doing
and we work my hours I 'll do the driving you do the paperwork You got ta learn it so you might as well do it all
No two
Yeah the shells are too big for six in an cylinder Hell Matt you do n't need but one
Only holds five
Casull 454 Magnum You 're talking twice the impact energy of 44 Magnum hot loads
What is it
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find Well this is it
They took the stuff out all of it this afternoon
Do n't piss him off O'Neal When he gets like this I ca n't control him I 've seen this before He got like this once I saw him jerk a guy 's spine out and show it to him Nothing I could do I hadda go throw up
Yes it is Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there I do n't know how these fellas do it
That where Anderson worked
I think you 're gon na find he 's taken the rest of his life off
Wait You know who it looks like Yeah Anderson Uh James Anderson He is n't in today He took the afternoon off
Who else can I ask around here
To be honest it 's hard to say I hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me
We think he could a been involved yeah You know him
You think this is the guy who did it
Well one of the men did n't like him so much
Mr Hubley was an all right guy and a damn good manager The men liked him I 'm really gon na have to scramble to fill his shoes
Sure Just a minute
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing
I 'm sorry Matt Nothing here seems to be matching up
Yeah we met him Wonderful boy close personal friend of George 's here
Released December one He and his wife moved first to Modesto then Coalinga California wherever that is settled in L.A in April Field of expertise organic chemical engineering He and his wife have one child a son
For you anything
Try Joshua Strader will ya darlin
Here 's Hubley Left Quarantine on November thirtieth relocated first to Riverside then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year Field of expertise chemical manufacturing Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery
That 's all I know You want anything more you ask somebody else
Yeah I heard of it
Yeah I seen him around High roller dude named Strader Joshua Strader Runs a club on the west side Encounters
One of the two men was Hubley right What about the other one Did you know him
What 's that
Ss'kya'ta
Jesus are the questions too tough for you already Let 's try again Is your name Porter
Did he find anything
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day
What kind of test
You mean the Blob They 're finishing up now
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet
Yeah I 'll bet
Oh here 's an extra headshot if you need one We 're just about to start cutting in You 're welcome to stick around if you want It 's really fascinating stuff
That 's the way these people are You do n't hit both pumps you just piss them off
Lucky nothing I had to empty my damn gun into him
Lucky for you you got him in both of his well what we loosely refer to as hearts
Yeah
You took this gut out too did n't you
Fedorchuk could n't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets
No I.D on him and well you know no fingerprints so it could be tough Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but could n't make a facial match
Yeah he was one Martin Helder White male twenty-seven Let 's see wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction a couple for sale of a controlled substance Oh yeah and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock
The human
Yeah right Do n't push your luck Anyway according to the sheet the guy you nailed outside by the car
Come on You got nothin better to do cushy county job like yours
You know I 've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning
Do n't tell me what to think
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes and Hubley 's body being found over in the Newcomer community
Granger and Pitts are already on it
You
Departmental policy
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle 's death You know that Leave that for Fedorchuk
Captain I 'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective
Yeah Sykes
I 'll cover you Get outta there
I ca n't Do you mind
Get outta there
I got him Do n't get pinned
Watch the driver I 'm going for a better angle on the door
Yeah that 's comforting Mine too
Of course Right in the trunk of the car
You got your vest
Whatever gave you that idea
Does that look at all suspicious to you
Shit if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it we 'd be holding the reception at Buddy 's Burgers
But you 're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing
Goddammit Tug I want to see Kristin get married okay But
Hey look we 've known Kristin since since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear Remember You and Edie banged the wall so hard me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week
What
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie have your landlady tie your shoes for you and show up at the church Simple Me and Carol are going
How can I go
It is
Hope their plumbing 's the same
Uh seems to be in front and behind
Talk to me Hudson
Ca n't lock up
Position
Movement
Rescue mission There 's some juicy colonists daughters we got ta rescue from virginity
Hey 'Top What 's the op
Let 's go let 's go Cycle through
Whoooah No shit I 'm impressed
Would you Sir
Christ I never saw such a buncha old women You want me to fetch your slippers Hudson
This floor 's freezing
Say again All after incinerators
Uh Apone I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC over
Let 's go Pull 'em out
Flame-units only I want rifles slung
Vasquez take point Let 's move
First squad up on line Hicks get yours in a cordon Watch the rear
Ten seconds people Look sharp
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast Immediate dust off on my 'clear then stay on station
Awright I want a nice clean dispersal this time
Okay let 's do it
Awright Fire-team A Gear up Let 's move Two minutes Somebody wake up Hicks
that 's better Pan it around a bit
Well thanks I
You did okay Bishop
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska
She 's alive They brought her here and you know it
Ripley
WE 'RE NOT LEAVING
PLENTY TWENTY-SIX MINUTES
HOW MUCH TIME
See you soon
It 's going to be closer You better get going
All right Let 's get on it What 'll you need
I 'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway Believe me I 'd prefer not to I may be synthetic but I 'm not stupid
What
I 'll go
I 'm afraid so The crash did too much damage The overload is inevitable at this point
And it 's too late to shut it down
I 'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers About equal to ten megatons
How long until it blows
That 's it See it Emergency venting
Hard to say It may have been blind instinct attraction to the heat of whatever but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we could n't destroy her without destroying ourselves That 's if she exists of course
Could it be intelligent
Well the queen is always physically larger then the others A termite queen 's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it ca n't move at all It is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors She is the center of their lives quite literally the mother of their society
You 're saying one of those things lays all the eggs
That is the question of the hour We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization An ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
But these things come from eggs so where are all the eggs coming from
Yes That follows
Which would mean lots of those parasites right One for each person over a hundred at least
Now let me get this straight The aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those
I 've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis It seems to be metabolizing He should wake up soon
Sorry to disappoint you
I expected more of you Ripley I thought you would be smarter than this
Look maybe the thing did n't even exist right And if I 'd made it a major security situation the Administration would 've stepped in Then no exclusive rights nothing
You sent them out there and you did n't even warn them Burke Why did n't you warn them
You sent them to that ship I just checked the colony log directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine Signed Burke Carter J
Now wait a second
But they will know about it Burke From me Just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here
You 've been doing your homework Look they ca n't impound it if they do n't know about it
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine Section 22350 of the Commerce Code
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division Now if you 're smart we can both come out of this heroes Set up for life
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command Right
Corporal Hicks
What rank I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here
Do n't make me pull rank Ripley
You son of a bitch
Bullshit
This is clearly an important species we 're dealing with here We ca n't just arbitrarily exterminate them
They can bill me I got a tab running What 's second
Well I mean I know this is an emotional moment but let 's not make snap judgments Let 's move cautiously First this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
Why not
Now hold on a second I 'm not authorizing that action
No good How do we know it 'll effect their biochemistry I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit It 's the only way to be sure
She 's right
That 's not what I mean Gorman if your men have to use their weapons in there they 'll rupture the cooling system
Yeah Maybe the organisms like the heat that 's why they built
They 're right under the primary heat exchangers
Uh-hunh One of thirty or so all over the planet They 're completely automated We manufacture them by the way
That the atmosphere processor
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you
I hope you 're right I really do
Well it did n't occur to me It 's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board
You never said anything about an android being here Why not
That 's the plan My word on it
Burke just tell me one thing That you 're going out there to kill them Not study Not bring back Just burn them out clean forever
Yello Oh Ripley Hi
No The answer is no Now please go I 'm sorry Just go would you
Yes and I 've read it You wake up every night sheets soaking the same nightmare over and over
Spare me Burke I 've had my psych evaluation this month
If you go It 's a second chance kiddo And it 'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it You got ta get back on the horse
If I go
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract
It 's all I could get Anyway it keeps my mind off of everything Days off are worse
Running loaders forklifts that sort of thing
That 's right
I heard you were working in the cargo docks
Yeah yeah I saw the commercial
Well the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration against mineral rights We 're getting into a lot of terraforming 'Building Better Worlds
What about you What 's your interest in this
I was reamed steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys and now you want me to go back out there Forget it
Hear me out
No There 's no way
You are a head case Have a donut
They had their minds made up before I even went in there They think I 'm a head case
You had them eating out of your hand kiddo
Just tell them what happened The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional
I get the picture
Look I believe you but there are going to be some heavyweights in there You got Feds you got interstellar commerce commission you got colonial administration insurance company guys
You read my deposition it 's complete and accurate
Cancer Hmmmm They still have n't licked that one Cremated Interred Parkside Repository Little Chute Wisconsin No children
Amy
Amanda Ripley-McClaren Married name I guess Age sixty-six at time of death Two years ago I 'm sorry
Is she
Well I was going to wait until after the inquest
Have they located my daughter yet
You 'd drifted right through the core systems It 's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they are you all right
Fifty-seven oh Christ
Shit Apone collect magazines from everybody We ca n't have any firing in there
We 're talking thermonuclear explosion
PDT 'S Personal-Data Transmitters Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted
What 's he scanning for
It 's insured
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony
Dead on all channels
Still nothing from the colony
We 're trained to deal with these kinds of situations
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres and they 're packing state-of-the-art firepower Nothing they ca n't handle right Lieutenant
You would n't be going in with the troops I can guarantee your safety
Look we do n't know what 's going on out there It may just be a down transmitter But if it 's not I want you there as an advisor That 's all
Forget it
All right I guess One hell of a hangover Look Ripley I
How do you feel
They 're but off Do something
I told them to fall back
Shut up Just shut up
GET THEM OUT OF THERE DO IT NOW
So So
So then the fusion containment shuts down
So
Proceed inside
I do n't know
What is it
Gorman Give it a rest would you
Where are your parents You have to try
Apone where are your people Anybody in D-Block
One of us
The structure seems intact They have power
Hold at forty Slow circle of the complex
Thirty-eight simulated
How may drops is this for you Lieutenant
You tell me I only work here
We 're not making that out too well What is it
Unknown But it looks like all of them Over at the processing station sublevel C under the south tower
Alive
Hah Stop your grinnin and drop your linen Found 'em
Okay stand by in operations Let 's go
Sir the CPU is on-line
He 's coming in I feel safer already
We 're coming in
All right the area 's secured Let 's go in and see what their computer can tell us First team head for operations Hudson see if you can get their CPU on line Hicks meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit
Are there any questions Hudson
All we know is that there 's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved
Is this going to be a stand-up fight Sir on another bug-hunt
What 's the question
Hudson Sir He 's Hicks
Yes Hicks
Sir
At ease I 'm sorry we did n't have time to brief before we left Gateway but
Fuckin A
Let 's go Let 's go
Six meters Five What the fu
Well you 're not reading it right
Let 's get these things lit
Seventeen meters
Do it
The corner Ready
I want you two walking the perimeter I know we 're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert We 've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand
Maybe we got 'em demoralized
I do n't fucking believe this Do you believe this
We got problems
Aye-firmative
Outstanding Then all we need 's a deck of cards All right let 's move like we got a purpose
Are you finished You okay
Well that 's great That 's just fucking great man Now what the fuck are we supposed to do man We 're in some real pretty shit now
Not that tunnel the other one
Let 's get the fuck out of here
Sure Hicks
Save it
Do n't be long Ellen
Ellen
We ai n't going anywhere
Hicks do n't let him leave
All right She 's alive I believe it But we got ta get moving Now
No No She 's alive We have to
Stand back
Locked
We did n't miss anything
They learned They cut the power and avoided the guns They must have found another way in something we missed
Get back here both of you Fall back to Operations
It 's game time
Let 's waste him No offense
You know Burke I do n't know which species is worse You do n't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked
Wait a minute We 'd know about it
Yeah I 've noticed
Look you started this Now show me everything I can handle myself
Well that 's the grenade launcher you probably do n't want to mess with that
What 's this
If it comes to that I 'll do us both Let 's see that it does n't Here I 'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine
Hicks I 'm not going to wind up like those others You 'll take care of it wo n't you it if comes to that
Maybe Maybe not
They 'll get us
But they do n't know that They 're probably looking for other ways to get in That 'll take them awhile
Newt time then can walk right up and knock
Ca n't tell Lots D gun 's down to twenty Ten It 's out
Now many
On my way
They 're in the approach corridor
That 's right So we put up welded barricades at these intersections and seal these ducts here and here Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units here
We got ta figure on them getting into the complex
All right There 's a fire door at this end The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door
About seventeen days
How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue
Poor bastard
Removed surgically before embryo implantation Subject Marachuk John L Died during procedure They killed him getting it off
No No It ai n't you They 're inside Inside the perimeter They 're in here
You 're just reading me
It 's inside the complex
Hudson give us a break
Oh man And I was gettin short too Four more weeks and out Now I 'm gon na buy it on this fuckin rock It ai n't half fair man
Maybe you have n't been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked pal
Yeah bullshit Watch us
Look man let 's just bug out and call it even okay
All right we ca n't blow the fuck out of them why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there Nerve gas the whole nest
Anytime Anywhere
Fuck you
Somebody said alien she thought they said illegal alien and signed up
No Have you
Hey Vasquez you ever been mistaken for a man
It 's readin right Look
Ca n't be That 's inside the room
Nine meters Eight
They 're right on us Vasquez how you doing
Twelve meters Man this is a big fucking signal Ten meters
I do n't know an acid hole in a duct Something under the floors not on the plans I do n't know
Fifteen meters
Seal the door
Range twenty meters
Just get back here
This signal 's weird must be some interference or something There 's movement all over the place
What do you mean they cut the power How could they cut the power man They 're animals
They cut the power
Oh right Right With those things running around No way
Well then somebody 's just going to have to go out there Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually
What about the colony transmitter That up-link tower down at the other end Why ca n't we use that
Think of what We 're fucked
I do n't care how Think of a way Think of something
How The transmitter was on the APC It 's wasted
We need the other drop-ship The on one the Sulaco We have to bring it down on remote somehow
Uh what 's next
Thanks
Yeah right it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here
This service tunnel is how they 're moving back and forth
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training
Man we 're not going to make it seventeen hours Those things are going to come in here just like they did before man they 're going to come in here and get us man long before
Oh God Jesus This ai n't happening
You ca n't help them Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others
Hey hey Look Crowe and Dietrich are n't dead man
Looks like it stung him
The embryo the second form hosts in the victim 's body for several hours Gestating Then it then it emerges Moults Grows rapidly
Sounds like you Hicks
Tell him as far as I 'm concerned he finds something it 's his
So what do I tell this guy
Christ Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere we look They do n't say why and I do n't ask I do n't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer 's always 'do n't ask
There 's a guy on the horn mom-and-pop survey team Says he 's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored
Yeah What
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau out past the Ilium range a couple days ago
No I 've slept enough
Bad dreams again Do you want something to help you sleep
Just a couple of days Do you feel up to a visitor
How long have I been on Gateway station
Just terrible That 's better than yesterday at least
Terrible
And how are we today
Yes honey I think we both can
Can we dream
That 's right
Are we going to sleep now
Right here baby Right here
Mommy Mommy
Newt I want you to hang on now Hang on tight
I knew you 'd come
Newt wait
This way Come on we 're almost there
Sure Go left
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here
Come on Crawl faster
Look
Burke Open the door
I know honey Me too
Mommy I mean Ripley I 'm scared
Sssh Do n't move We 're in trouble
Wah Where are
Newt Newt wake up
I 'll be right in the other room Newt And look I can see you on that camera right up there
Do n't go Please
You mean dead
Gone
Where is she
Yes A little girl
Did you ever have a baby
No it 's different honey
Is n't that how babies come I mean people babies they grow inside you
I do n't know Newt That 's the truth
Did one of those things grow inside her
Well some kids ca n't handle it like you can
Why do they tell little kids that
Yes there are are n't there
My mommy always said there were no monsters No real ones But there are
Oh Sorry Newt
Ripley she does n't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic
I do n't want to I have scary dreams
Now you just lie here and have a nap You 're exhausted
You do n't have to be sorry It was n't your fault
I 'm sorry Newt
I guess we 're not leaving right
You 're really something ace
Yeah you know In the walls under the floor I was the ace I could hide better than anybody
The 'maze You mean the air ducts
I was the best at the game I knew the whole maze
And hope to die
Cross my heart
You promise
Newt Look at me Newt I wo n't leave you I promise
They 're dead
They 'd be here if they could honey I know they would
Because you 'll be gone soon like the others Like everybody You 'll be dead and you 'll leave me alone
Why not
I do n't want you for a friend
What about me
Casey She 's my only friend
Newt My n-name 's Newt Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother
What did you say
Sweet Jesus
LEUWEN Sixty maybe seventy families
How many colonists
What are you talking about What people
LEUWEN Because I do n't have to The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism or alien ship And by the way they call it Acheron now
Why wo n't you check out LV-426
because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew within twelve hours of hatching
LEUWEN Thank you Officer Ripley That will be
Look I can see where this is going But I 'm telling you those things exist Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs Thousands Do you understand I suggest you find it using the flight recorder 's data Find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise
That 's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock Like I said
LEUWEN The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe
LEUWEN It did not however contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up
Look I told you
At present the girls only peck me Their cruelty surely will wreck me But one little beak in my own And I 'll up to heaven be flown At present the girls only peck me But one little beak in my own And I 'll up to heaven be flown Up to heaven be flown Up to heaven be flown
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish A willing billing lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely But if she wo n't fly to my aid Then into a ghost I must fade I need to net one birdie only But if she wo n't fly to my aid Then into a ghost I must fade To a ghost I must fade To a ghost I must fade
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno 's wish A willing billing lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish
Then that would be eating and drinking I 'd live like a Prince without thinking The wisdom of old would be mine A woman 's much better than wine Then that would be eating and drinking The wisdom of old would be mine A woman 's much better than wine She 's much better than wine She 's much better than wine

What do you mean
His Grace is very angry with you
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it
Indeed
Well I think that went off remarkably well do n't you
Certainly
Follow me please The Archbishop would like a word
Meaning you did n't like it
Extremely clever
What did you think of the music
You were sublime
How was I Tell me honestly
Nothing He can marry who he pleases I do n't give a damn
Well what does it matter to you
The marriage
What
Did you know Had you heard
Looks do n't concern me Maestro Only talent interests a woman of taste
Looks and talent do n't always go together Katherina
Why
You might be disappointed
What does he look like
Perhaps
Oh Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway
My dear it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk
Turkish Oh if it 's Turkish that 's different I want to be in it
A Turkish brothel
Oh
A brothel
What 's that
In a harem
Where
Well do you know where it 's set my dear
Why not
Well even if there is I do n't think you want to get involved with this one
How do you know
No
Is there a part for me
Yes
And he 's been commissioned to write an opera Is it true
Oh News travels fast in Vienna
Well I heard you met Herr Mozart
Really What else did he tell you today Give me some gossip
Well How do you like it It 's Turkish My hairdresser tells me everything 's going to be Turkish this year
Good morning
Maestro
Excuse us Fraulein Good night Signore
No no no no You ca n't take him away now This is his night Wo n't you introduce us Wolfgang
I assume she 's the virtuoso in that department There ca n't be any other reason you 'd marry someone like that
What
Is she a good fuck
I 'm so relieved
No she 's fine
Is her mother still lying on the floor
Oh excuse me
I 'll be right back
Do n't bother
What
Do n't bother
Katherina I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do I 'm going to write another aria for you Something even more amazing for the second act I have to get some water Her mother is lying on the stage
Oh Your Grace I thank Your Grace I thank you
You have leave to try
Oh sir he 's never disobeyed me in anything Please Your Grace give him one more chance
And how will you make him keep it
Yes sir that 's the truth But do n't blame him The fault is mine I was too indulgent with him But not again Never again I promise I implore you let me bring him back here I 'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully
Your son is an unprincipled spoiled conceited brat
Sir
I 'm not surprised Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship He has sold himself to Vienna Let Vienna look out for him
Oh sir yes He 's about to make the worst mistake of his life Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage I know my son He is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him
Hardly
But he needs to be here in Salzburg Your Grace He needs me and he needs you Your protection your understanding
No I wo n't have him back
Then try harder Mozart I have no intention of dismissing you You will remain in my service and learn your place Go now
No Your Grace I mean with all humility no I would rather you dismissed me It 's obvious I do n't satisfy
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg Your father is waiting for you there patiently I will speak to you further when I come
If His Grace is not satisfied with me he can dismiss me
How much provocation am I to endure from you The more license I allow you the more you take
Humiliated
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants
Why what sir
Oh shut up I 'm sick to death of that tune
In the pot I have got a good dinner Not a sausage or stew but a singer Not a sausage or stew but a singer Is the treat that I 'll eat for my meat
Are you drunk You invited me And my horse Here he is Ottavio

Stanzi
Look old man you stay out of this We spend a fortune on you more than we can possibly afford and all you do is criticize morning to night And then you think you can

Stop it
Madame I will respect his He asked me to stay here
I regret we have no servants to show you out Herr Salieri Respect my wish and go
He 's not going to work on this anymore It is making him ill Please
No I was assisting him He asked me
This is not his handwriting
And I 'm asking you
He asked me to stay
No he does n't And I do n't want you here Just go please
He needs me ma'am
Well thank you very much You can go now
I was at hand
Why you
Your husband is ill ma'am He took sick I brought him home
What are you doing here
Should we stay here It 's a charming room I love these candlesticks Were they here earlier I did n't notice them I suppose I was too nervous
What
I do apologize for this afternoon I behaved like a silly girl Where shall we go
Then do n't It 's up to you Not to be vague that is the price
But I 'm a married woman
It 's a post all Vienna seeks If you want it for your husband come tonight
Is n't it obvious
What do you mean
Some service deserves service in return No
What for
Alone
Tonight
Come back tonight
Oh thank you sir
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor One word from me and the post is his
Oh yes He 's really proud of his work
It is miraculous
Yes sir He does n't make copies
These are originals
Yes
Originals
That 's very tempting but it 's impossible I 'm afraid Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing You see they 're all originals
Are you sure you ca n't leave that music and come back again I have other things you might like
Do n't keep calling me that It puts me at such a distance I was not born a Court Composer you know I 'm from a small town just like your husband
Thank you very much Your Excellency
Sir we really need this job We 're desperate My husband spends far more than he can ever earn I do n't mean he 's lazy he 's not at all he works all day long It 's just he 's not practical Money simply slips through his fingers it 's really ridiculous Your Excellency I know you help musicians You 're famous for it Give him just this one post We 'd be forever indebted
I see
No sir This is my own idea
Then he did n't send you
My husband is a proud man sir He would be furious if he knew I 'd come
Really
I I really can not do that Your Excellency You see he does n't know I 'm here
I 'm afraid I 'm not at leisure this very moment Just leave them with me I assure you they will be quite safe
Would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now While I wait
I will look at them of course the moment I can It will be an honour Please give him my warmest
I understand
He 's terribly busy sir
How charming But why did he not come himself
That 's right Your Excellency I 've come on behalf of my hus band I 'm I 'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment
Frau Mozart
Madame How can I help you
Excellency
Oh yes and who are you He 's worked for Kings For the Emperor Who are you
You 're mad She 's mad Wolfi
Money Money
Oh yes And what 's so intelligent about writing a Requiem
You know what 's ridiculous Your libretto that 's what 's ridiculous Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff
I 'm paying people just to wait for you It 's ridiculous
He 's doing his best
I 'm paying these people Do you realize that
Leave him alone
Look you little clown do you know how many people I 've hired for you Do you know how many people are waiting
I hope so I need it immediately
He 's not in But he 's working on it He said to tell you
Where 's our friend
Not at all
Am I interrupting something
Ah Well Ah I see you 've got your manager with you Well Madame how about half the receipts
How much will you pay him
Do you hear him Do you
So you are The place is a pigsty all the time
Oh now I 'm a bad housekeeper
And what do you expect Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day
And so you do The only time you come out is to eat
Well this is none of your business Whoever sent you is going to pay no
But you ca n't take her without reference It 's unheard of
What is ridiculous Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna They love him here People send us gifts all the time
In three months Papa
When may I ask
Oh yes
I see that you 're expecting
LADY Behold
LADY Behold
LADY Hey
LADY Hey
LADY Behold
LADY Behold
LADY Adorable
LADY He 's adorable
LADY Be careful
LADY Be careful
WEBER Young man I am no stranger to theatres I 'm no stranger to insolence
I am sorry Madame but no I can not let anyone pass
WEBER Call Herr Mozart You call Herr Mozart immediately This is insupportable
I am sorry Madame but I have my orders
WEBER Do you know who I am This is my daughter I am Frau Weber We are favoured guests
I am sorry Madame It is not permitted
WEBER Let us pass please Let us pass at once We 're with the Emperor
Yes He is a little strange
SCHLUMBERG What a strange young man
SCHLUMBERG Michael
I said play
SCHLUMBERG Michael please I 'm sure you will find her most willing Herr Mozart She 's really very excited She 's been preparing all morning
People who know say the girl 's got talent You must judge for yourself If you think she stinks say so
SCHLUMBERG It 's such an honour for us to have you here Herr Mozart And for Gertrude
Gertrude
SCHLUMBERG I 've heard about you for ages I thought you must be an old man
SCHLUMBERG You ca n't be Herr Mozart
Gertrude
SCHLUMBERG Upstairs
Thank you Madame Come on now courage Play me something you know
SCHLUMBERG I was But she quite outgrew the little I could show her
Who was your teacher
SCHLUMBERG Just one year
SCHLUMBERG Wine
I 'd like a little wine if you have it
SCHLUMBERG Perhaps a little refreshment first A little coffee or a little chocolate
SCHLUMBERG Ah now Here she comes
Really
Well look at them
It is not a question of liking Your Majesty Your own law decrees it I 'm afraid
Do you like this Salieri
Molested Majesty Twice in the course of the same lesson
Yes
As a matter of fact one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well
Really
I have to tell you Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
Of course not
Majesty I do n't like to talk against a fellow musician
Oh
Well Sire I made some inquiries in a routine way I was curious to know why he had so few pupils It is rather alarming
Why not
Majesty I did Believe me it was a most agonizing decision But finally I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart
I do n't think you understand me Court Composer
Well There it is
Sire
You please me Court Composer A very clever idea
I 'm sure there is a way Majesty Some kind of a little contest I could perhaps put together a small Committee and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty 's wishes
Ah-ha Favouritism But I so want Mozart
Yes of course My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
And the result satisfies
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart
Yes
An interesting idea Majesty But
I 'm thinking about Herr Mozart What is your view
Oh Your Majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
Your Highness
Good morning Court Composer This is my niece the Princess Elizabeth
Cattivo again Court Composer Well tell him Mozart Name us a German virtue
Excuse me Sire but what do you think these could be Being a foreigner I would love to learn
Well I 'm glad to hear that
Well there it is Now to business Young man we are going to commission an opera from you What do you say
My pleasure
Finally Such an immense joy Diletto straordinario
And here is our illustrious Court Composer Herr Salieri
Ah-ha
A-flat Majesty
Let 's have some fun Bring in Herr Mozart please But slowly slowly I need a minute to practice
You do me too much honour Sire
Delightful Court Composer Would you permit me to play it as he comes in
Majesty
May I try it
It 's just a trifle of course
What a charming idea May I see
You are cattivo Court Composer I want to meet this young man Chamberlain arrange a pleasant welcome for him
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna Majesty It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure if that is your Majesty 's intention
Sire the whole opera is finished Do you know how much work went into it
You are passionate Mozart But you do not persuade
Forgive me Majesty I 'm a vulgar man But I assure you my music is not
Twenty sire How about twenty Twenty minutes of continuous music No recitatives
Well six or seven minutes maybe eight
Guess Guess Majesty Imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
I have no idea
But it 's new it 's entirely new It 's so new people will go mad for it For example I have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling Suddenly the wife 's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation Duet turns into trio Then the husband 's equally screaming valet comes in Trio turns into quartet Then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on On and on sextet septet octet How long do you think I can sustain that
Ah love again
But Majesty this is just a frolic It 's a piece about love
I think you are rather innocent my friend In these dangerous times I can not afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
Sire I swear to Your Majesty there 's nothing like that in the story I have taken out everything that could give offense I hate politics
Mozart I am a tolerant man I do not censor things lightly When I do I have good reason Figaro is a bad play It stirs up hatred between the classes In France it has caused nothing but bitterness My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people I do not wish to see the same fears starting here
Well Majesty it is only a comedy
Would you tell me why
Well yes I admit it is
It is not your place to ask questions Is it true
Who told you this Majesty
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it Is this true
Yes Sire
Mozart are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre
Ah By all means
May I introduce my father He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg He would so much like to kiss your hand It would make his whole stay so memorable for him
What is it
Majesty may I ask you to do me the greatest favour
Thank you Sire
Bravo Mozart Most charming Yes indeed Clever man
Well my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna
Twenty-six
Excuse me but how old are you
Well Well we have n't quite received my father 's consent Your Majesty Not entirely Not altogether
Really How delightful May I ask when you marry
Enchanted Madame
Majesty this is Madame Weber She is my landlady
Which few did you have in mind Majesty
My dear young man do n't take it too hard Your work is ingenious It 's quality work And there are simply too many notes that 's all Cut a few and it will be perfect
My dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening I think I 'm right in saying that are n't I Court Composer
I do n't understand There are just as many notes Majesty as are required Neither more nor less
Well I mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say How shall one say Director
What do you mean Sire
Of course I do It 's very good Of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate
So then you like it You really like it Your Majesty
Oh yes Absolutely German Unquestionably
And German
Yes indeed
It is new it is is n't it Sire
I think so Sire yes
What On one hearing only
Keep it Sire if you want to It is already here in my head
Ah-ha
In a Pasha 's Harem Majesty A Seraglio
Yes where
It 's actually quite amusing Majesty It 's set the whole thing is set in a in a
Well what is it about Tell us the story
Because I 've already found the most wonderful libretto
Why so
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian
Majesty
Really Oh grazie Signore Sono commosso E un onore per mo eccezionale Compositore brilliante e famossissimo
And now he has returned the compliment Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you
Oh sir yes The honour is mine Absolutely
The Director of our Opera Count Orsini-Rosenberg
Oh thank you
No no please It is not a holy relic You know we have met already In this very room Perhaps you wo n't remember it you were only six years old He was giving the most brilliant little concert here As he got off the stool he slipped and fell My sister Antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did Jumped straight into her arms and said Will you marry me yes or no
Your Majesty
Ah-ha Well There it is Good
STRACK He 's here
Yes what about him
STRACK Your Majesty Herr Mozart
Well what do you have for me today
Well There it is
STRACK Yes sir
STRACK In my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir Plain German For plain people
Ah-ha What do you say Chamberlain
Very small pay I imagine I 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer Say an opera in German for our National Theatre
STRACK I agree Majesty but I 'm afraid it 's not possible The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop
Ah-ha Well then we should make some effort to acquire him We could use a good German composer in Vienna surely
Hush I 'm talking to His Majesty Your Majesty I wish to express only one thing that you who are the Father of us all could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us 'Honour your Father and Mother that your days may be long upon the earth
Father
She does She says I sleep all day
No one calls you that
Do n't worry I 'm not staying here to be a burden
Papa
Never mind You wo n't have to do anything for me ever again I 'm leaving
I never saw this girl in my life Is this a kind of joke
Are you playing a trick on me
Mine
Papa is this your idea
But my penalty I 've got to have a penalty
I 'm tired of this game Please play without me
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg my son
Yes Papa name it Name it I 'll do anything you say
This is just a game Papa
No really
Why not Oh come Papa What better way could I spend it than on you My kissable missable suddenly visible Papa
Thank you That 'll be fine Do n't spend any money on me
Did n't I I thought I did I 'm sure I did
Why did n't you mention it in your letters
Is n't that marvelous We 're delighted
It 's too dangerous Papa But they 're going to love it Ah there she is
You do n't have secrets from me
It 's a secret
Why not
Oh let 's not talk about it
What 's that
This one will
Composition does n't pay You know that
I do n't know It 's not important I mean I do n't want pupils They get in the way I 've got to have time for composition
How many
Yes
Yes
Pupils
How many pupils do you have
Who Who says that Now that 's a malicious lie
They say you 're in debt
What do you mean It 's wonderful Really it 's it 's marvelous People love me here
That 's not what I hear
It could n't be better
How is your financial situation
Oh we could if we wanted to but Stanzi wo n't hear of it She wants to do everything herself
Do n't you have a maid
She 's very tired poor creature You know me I 'm a real pig It 's not so easy cleaning up after me
Oh yes Oh I mean no not exactly like this I mean today just today Stanzi I remember now She had to go yes She had to help her mother Yes she 's like that Her mother 's a very sweet woman you 'll see
Do you always live like this
I do n't know Stanzi Stanzi
Is she not here
Feed Well of course she feeds me She stuffs me like a goose all day long She 's the best cook in the world I mean since Mama Just wait you 'll see
Of course welcome Welcome ten thousand times Papa my Papa
Am I not welcome
Why are you here
I will
I write to you with urgent news I am coming to Vienna Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet You are too gullible to see your own danger As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours do as I bid and await my coming
Are you sure it 's an opera
Please do n't ask me to go back again I 'm frightened I 'm very very frightened
Opera Opera
I suppose so He sits there all he time doing some silly opera
Is he working
I 'm frightened sir Really When he speaks he does n't make any sense You know he said he saw he said he saw his father And his father 's dead
Is he working
Here in his stomach They bend him right over
Where
I do n't know He has pains
What medicine
You do n't know what it 's like Herr Mozart frightens me He drinks all day then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse
Why What has happened
I 'm leaving I 'm not working there anymore I 'm scared
Now calm yourself Calm What 's the matter with you
In there sir
Where does he work
Yes what
I think I 've found out about the money sir
Of course not You 're a good girl You 're very kind to do this Next time you 're sure they 'll be out of the house let me know will you
Oh I would n't know that sir
Really What is it he 's writing
Oh yes sir all day long He never leaves the house until evening He just sits there writing and writing He does n't even eat
Then how does he pay for all this Does he work at all
Not that I 've seen
Do any pupils come to the house
Oh thank you sir
Bene
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson sir
Bene Bene
Yes thank you sir
Thank you Are you well today Fraulein Lorl
I will sir
Ah-ha Siena macaroons my favourites Give my best thanks to the baker
What have you got for me today Let me see
Good morning sir
Ah Here she comes Fraulein Lorl good morning
Yes I can live in or out just as you wish
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and does n't want us to know who he is
They 'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous
What
My name is Lorl sir I 'm a maidservant I was asked to come here and offer my services to you
That 's right
Are you Herr Mozart
Yes
So let me see it Where is it
Well we can
Look I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes
Because there 's nothing to see
Why not
No
Can I see it
Yes
What The vaudeville what 'd you think
What
Oh I 'm sorry I 'm sorry What have you got for me Is it finished
Put it down I said It 's nothing for you
What is this
Put it down
Wolfi
Leave that alone
So there you are What do you say
No no I love that I 'd want it to be in German I have n't done anything in German since Seraglio
Of course What else do you think they speak here
German
I 'm serious You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs I 'll guarantee you 'll have a triumph de-luxe Mind you it 'll have to be in German
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week twelve foot long folds up to six inches just like a paper fan It 's a miracle
Animals
'Course you would You belong here my boy not the snobby Court You could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better That 's what people want you know fantasy You do a big production fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you 'll be absolutely free to do anything you want Of course you 'd have to put a fire in it because I 've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life Oh and a few trick animals You 'd have to use those
I 'd like to try them someday I 'm not sure I 'd be much good at it
Is n't he marvelous He cost me a bundle that horse but he 's worth it I tell you if you 'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success I 'm not joking These people are n't fools You could do something marvelous for them
I liked the horse
Yes well it 's all good fun
Wonderful He liked the monkey did n't you
That kind of music should be punishable by death
Sublime Utterly sublime
Well
Papa the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room
What did he say What did he say
Sssh Stay here
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi
Sssh
My answer is no Mozart
Please I 'll give it back I promise Please sir
I 'm sorry No
No doubt sir But I am endowed with talent and you with money If I offer mine you should offer yours
Well this is hardly the way to go about it
If a man can not earn he must borrow
What for
Well Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
What is this Mozart What 's the matter with you
Really Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
Well your pupil is married and living in Mannheim young man
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music

The end of the Recordare Statuens in parte dextra
Where did I stop
A Mass A Mass for the Dead
Then let us try together I 'd regard it as such an honour Tell me what is this work
You know it 's all here in my head It 's just ready to be set down But when I 'm dizzy like this my eyes wo n't focus I ca n't write
Of course
But you 'd have to swear not to tell a soul I 'm not allowed
My dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure
Would you Actually you could
Yes Can I could I help you in any way
Another But that 's too soon Tomorrow night It 's impossible Did he say a hundred
He knows He knows
Finish what
Wait Ask him if he 'd give me some money now Tell him if he would that would help me finish it
What man
The man He 's here
Who
No No it 's him
Shall I answer it
I 'm too young to be so sick
What
The doctor thinks I am But
Are you ill
I have bad fancies I do n't sleep well anymore Then I drink too much and think stupid things
I do
Do you mean that
Oh no It is a sublime piece The grandest operone I tell you you are the greatest composer known to me
This is only a vaudeville
I would never miss anything that you had written You must know that
I mean to come to my opera You are the only colleague who did
No please
You 're so good to me Truly Thank you
You mean she 's not coming back
Not here She 's not well either She went to the Spa
Where is your wife
No no I have to get back I have
I 'm taking you home You 're not well
What happened Is it over
No no I promise you I 'll give you a wonderful piece the best I ever can
Are you neglecting my request
I do n't have it yet It 's not finished I 'm sorry but I need more time
Work fast And be sure to tell no one what you do You will see me again soon
How long will you give me
How much
I am only a messenger Do you accept You will be paid well
Who are you
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one
What dead Who is dead
A Mass for the dead
What work
I have come to commission work from you
Oh no One hears such sounds and what can one say but Salieri
You flatter me
I never knew that music like that was possible
Yes
How could it not Excellency
Did my work please you
How could I not
Mozart It was good of you to come
Grazie a lei Signor Antonio
Grazie mio caro Wolfgang
Oh no the honour would be all mine
I would n't presume All the same if it would n't be imposing I would like you to see my new piece It would be a tremendous honour for me
I know I know Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese my friend Do you know you did n't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
It 's the best opera yet written I know it Why did n't they come
I think it 's marvelous Truly
What did you think of it yourself Did you like it at all
Well I can speak for the Emperor You made too many demands on the royal ear The poor man ca n't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
But what is it they do n't like
I know it 's outrageous Still if the public does n't like one 's work one has to accept the fact gracefully
Nine performances Nine That 's all it 's had and withdrawn
Thank you Oh thank you
With all my heart Mozart
Oh Excellency would you
But there are those who have power over him I think I 'll take this up with the Emperor
It 's not fair that a man like that has power over our work
How fortunate
Oh no My wife took it out in time
You burned the score
Oh I could kill him I mean really kill him I actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg He 's obviously no friend of yours
I do n't know They say I 've got to re-write the opera but it 's perfect as it is I ca n't rewrite what 's perfect Ca n't you talk to him
Really Why
It 's unbelievable The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music Pages of it
Wolfgang what is it Sta calmo per favore What 's the matter
I do n't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor Mozart However I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you And he has a daughter Will that do
I ca n't say Really
What exactly are you working on
Two thousand two hundred florins is all I need A hundred Fifty
Forgive me We all have patriotic feelings of some kind
Ah Italian
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum Crema al Mascarpone
Actually it 's a big secret Oh this is delicious What is it
Come come Mozart I 'm interested Truly
I 'd better not It 's a bit of a secret
Ah how exciting Tell me more
Well could you lend me some money till you have one Then I 'll teach her for free That 's a promise Oh I 'm sorry I 'm being silly Papa 's right I should put a padlock on my mouth Seriously is there any chance you could manage a loan Only for six months eight at most After that I 'll be the richest man in Vienna I 'll pay you back double Anything Name your terms I 'm not joking I 'm working on something that 's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe
I 'm afraid not
Do you have a daughter
Of course not
They 're stupendously successful You ca n't get a seat The only problem is none will hire me They all want to hear me play but they wo n't let me teach their daughters As if I was some kind of fiend I 'm not a fiend
How is that possible You give concerts do n't you I hear they are quite successful
How can anyone say that We have no cook no maid We have no footman Nothing at all
It has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
No but I 'm broke I 'm always broke I do n't know why
You do n't mean to tell me you are living in poverty
Look I must have pupils Without pupils I ca n't manage
An implausible idea Between you and me no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth
But I ca n't lose this post I simply ca n't Excellency please Let 's go to the palace and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice He could actually do musical harm to the Princess
No no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity
Sommer Herr Sommer But the man 's a fool He 's a total mediocrity
Herr Sommer
Whom did they choose
My dear Mozart there is no one in the world I would rather help but now it is too late
Filled That 's impossible They have n't even seen my work I need this post Please ca n't you help me Please
I have just come from the palace The post has been filled
Why Here is the music It 's here I am submitting it humbly Is n't that what you wanted
Why did n't you come to me yesterday Mozart This is a most painful situation Yesterday I could have helped you Today I ca n't
So you see this post is very important to me right now
I 'm flattered And congratulations to you of course
She is well She is well actually I 'm about to become a father She only told me last night You are the first to know
So you are How is your pretty wife
Your Excellency you requested some specimens of my work Here they are I do n't have to tell you how much I need your help I truly appreciate your looking at these I have pressures on me financial pressures As you know I 'm a married man now
Herr Mozart what brings you here
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today Do n't you agree
How could I not
Did you like it then
Dear Mozart my sincere congratulations
But this is absurd
Yes yes er on the whole yes Majesty
Ah love Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that
Love Sire
A funny little tune but it yielded some good things
Ah
Mio caro Adone
Really
I know your work well Signore Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours
Oh yes certainly Certainly Herr Director
Can we see the scene with the music back please
Taking out what you should never have put in
What are you doing Herr Director
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty 's edicts Give me your score please
But surely the Emperor did n't mean to prohibit dancing when it 's part of the story
Exactly A dance
Yes but this is not a ballet This is a dance at Figaro 's wedding
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
Certainly Herr Director
Mozart Herr Mozart may I have a word with you please Right away
Just let me tell you how it begins
That will do Herr Mozart
But Your Majesty
What you think Mozart is scarcely the point It is what His Majesty thinks that counts
Well not especially It can be in Turkish if you really want I do n't care
Then why especially does it have to be in German
Exactly
You mean in Turkey
I think you 'd better
I I do n't think you have Herr Director Not yet I mean it 's quite n Of course I 'll show it to you immediately
Oh Have I seen it
May I just do that Majesty Show you how it begins Just that
STRACK Herr Mozart
Must I Well I wo n't I tell you straight I will not
STRACK Look young man the issue is simple If you want this post you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint Ohime Morbidezza Morbidezza Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music
STRACK Mozart
They hate my music It terrifies them The only sound Italians understand is banality Tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to Resurrection Ba-ba Ba-ba Ba-ba Ba-ba Anything else is morbid
STRACK Mozart
Naturally the Italians Of course Always the Italians
STRACK Kapellmeister Bonno Count Orsini Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri
Who is on this committee
STRACK A little modesty would suit you better
No but I 'm the best
STRACK Mozart you are not the only composer in Vienna
Then why does n't he simply appoint me to the post
STRACK On the contrary
Is the Emperor angry with me
STRACK Because His Majesty wishes it
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl
STRACK What is what
What is this Herr Chamberlain
SWIETEN Because they do They go on forever at least what they represent The eternal in us not the ephemeral Opera is here to ennoble us You and me just as much as His Majesty
Elevated What does that mean Elevated The only thing a man should elevate is oh excuse me I 'm sorry I 'm stupid But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things Old dead legends How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
SWIETEN Mozart music is not the issue here No one doubts your talent It is your judgment of literature that 's in question Even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce Why waste your spirit on such rubbish Surely you can choose more elevated themes
Sire only opera can do this In a play if more than one person speaks at the same time it 's just noise No one can understand a word But with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and it 's not noise it 's a perfect harmony Is n't that marvelous
SWIETEN Mozart
Baron
SWIETEN Well done Mozart Really quite fine
Why not It 's charming I mean I do n't actually show concubines exposing their their It 's not indecent It 's highly moral Majesty It 's full of proper German virtues I swear it Absolutely
SWIETEN My dear fellow the language is not finally the point Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre
Oh German German Please let it be German
SWIETEN I do n't think it was really decided Director
SALIERI Do n't pity me Pity yourself You serve a wicked God He killed Mozart not I Took him snatched him away without pity He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory He does n't care Understand that God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses He broke Mozart in half when He 'd finished with him and threw him away Like an old worn out flute
Oh my son my poor son
SALIERI No Father From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me Whenever they say Mozart with love they 'll have to say Salieri with loathing And that 's my immortality at last Our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy At least it 's better than the total oblivion he 'd planned for me your merciful God
My son why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer Is that your penance Is it
SALIERI What difference does that make
But not his body
SALIERI I poisoned his life
No you did n't
SALIERI I did
Why Why Why Why add to your misery by confessing to murder You did n't kill him
SALIERI The only thing that worried me was the actual killing How does one do that How does one kill a man It 's one thing to dream about it It 's very different when you have to do it with your own hands
Yes
SALIERI His funeral imagine it The Cathedral all Vienna sitting there His coffin Mozart 's little coffin in the middle And suddenly in that silence music A divine music bursts out over them all a great Mass of Death Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri What sublimity What depth What passion in the music Salieri has been touched by God at last And God forced to listen Powerless powerless to stop it I at the end for once laughing at Him Do you understand Do you
What
SALIERI Oh yes yes yes yes yes Always the same stale answers There is no God of Mercy Father Just a God of torture
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries I treasure them As you should
SALIERI Oh I thought you did so every day So speak now Answer me
My son no one can speak for God
SALIERI All I ever wanted was to sing to Him That 's His doing is n't it He gave me that longing then made me mute Why Tell me that If He did n't want me to serve Him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent Go on tell me Speak for Him
God 's ways are not yours And you are not here to question Him Offer him the salt of penitence He will give you back the bread of eternal life He is all merciful That is all you need to know
SALIERI No Was Mozart a good man
You can not say that
SALIERI Yes Father Yes So much for my vow of chastity What did it matter Good patient hard-working chaste what did it matter Had goodness made me a good composer I realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art And I was nothing to God
SALIERI Every day Sometimes for hours I would pray
Did you try
SALIERI It was incomprehensible What was God up to Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God 's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married and no rebuke at all Was it possible I was being tested Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful That was very possible All the same why him Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts I could n't stop them
SALIERI He was murdered Father Mozart Cruelly murdered
Do you hear me
Should I
SALIERI Do you believe it
Is it true
SALIERI And do they believe it
All Vienna has heard that
SALIERI Ah you 've heard that
Of course The man you accuse yourself of killing
SALIERI I did n't That was Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart You know who that is
Oh I know that That 's charming I did n't know you wrote that
SALIERI Can you recall no melody of mine I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy I wrote forty operas alone What about this little thing
I regret it is not too familiar
SALIERI Well
SALIERI I 'm surprised you do n't know It was a very popular tune in its day I wrote it How about this
I ca n't say I do What is it
SALIERI Then you must know this
Here in Vienna
SALIERI Where
I know a little I studied it in my youth
SALIERI How well are you trained in music
My son there is something dreadful on your soul Unburden it to me I 'm here only for you Please talk to me
SALIERI I do not seek forgiveness
Offer me your confession I can offer you God 's forgiveness
SALIERI Are they
That makes no difference All men are equal in God 's eyes
SALIERI Do you know who I am You never heard of me did you
I can not leave alone a soul in pain
SALIERI Leave me alone
Do you understand that you have sinned Gravely
SALIERI What do you want
In the sight of God that is a sin
SALIERI So
You tried to take your life You do remember that do n't you
SALIERI About what
I am Father Vogler I am a Chaplain here I thought you might like to talk to someone
SALIERI What do you want
Yes in the third act
Yes absolutely Is there a ballet in Figaro
Excuse me did n't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
Ballet What ballet
About the ballet
What anger
The Emperor has given him permission
Incredible
Well Mozart is already rehearsing
Never mind
Where
I 've seen the manuscript
Are you absolutely sure
You must be mad
Yes
He 's setting that play to music
Exactly
You mean that play
Italian
Mozart is writing a new opera An Italian opera
Yes
I 've just learned something that might be of interest to you Herr Director
STRACK Ah
Well the play makes a hero out of a valet He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher Do you see the implications This would be in a grander situation as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor
STRACK Oh yes yes And that was
For the same reason Herr Chamberlain that it was banned in France
STRACK I know we banned this play but frankly I ca n't remember why Can you refresh my memory Herr Director
STRACK Did we
Well actually Sire if you remember we did finally incline to Italian
STRACK Well done Sire
Bravo Your Majesty
OLD WOMAN Oh I 'm tender enough for you my boy I 'm tender enough for you
Well I do n't know I mean you 're a delicious delightful delectable little bird but do n't you think you might be just a little tough
OLD WOMAN Of course now Right away before I get any older
What do you mean now
OLD WOMAN Well promise then
I ca n't wait
OLD WOMAN Now you 've got to promise me faithfully you 'll remain true to me forever Then you 'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you
Oh Well thank you How wonderful Some people get all the luck
OLD WOMAN I 've taken pity on you my angel I heard your wish
What Who the devil are you
OLD WOMAN Here I am my angel
Indeed Just a moment as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him A very appropriate person to do so Yes
SWIETEN How sad It 's tragic is n't it Such a talent
No Baron no I 'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna He is constantly drunk He never pays his debts I ca n't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him
SWIETEN Ca n't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him I 've done my best I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts He got a fee what I could afford Ca n't you think of anyone who might do something for him
I agree Baron
SWIETEN This is embarrassing you know You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he 's begging from practically all of them It has to stop
Come with me And stay in the room
He did n't say sir I told him I did n't know when you would be back but he insisted on waiting
What does he want
Show her in Then go to bed
That lady is back sir
Excuse me my dear
She did n't say But she says it 's urgent
Who is she
Excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
Yes indeed Goodnight to you all now It was perfection truly
Oh by the way give him this This is his share That should cheer him up eh
Yes And congratulations to all of you It was superb
I 'll call tomorrow
Bene
And say everything went wonderfully A triumph-de-luxe say that Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times
Of course
Well tell him we were here wo n't you
Oh yes He 's just exhausted He became dizzy that 's all We should let him rest
But he 's all right
Well he 's sleeping now Better not
Can we come in
Yes I am looking after him
Herr Salieri
Thank you
I 'm an orderly not a bleeding psychiatrist I push things about but I 've little say what happens to them
You know did he seem depressed Do you think he 'll eat the food
What do you mean 'how did he look
How did he look
The American Yes duck
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet
HIRSCH I doubt it But it 's something to do
David
HIRSCH Nurse Hobbs said there 's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog
HIRSCH Tea would be nice
What shall we do
HIRSCH I expect you shortly
No a cab will be faster
HIRSCH Shall I send a car
He 's fine We 'll come right over
HIRSCH You 're certain he 's lucid You wo n't need any help
Yes Doctor
HIRSCH Right Now listen carefully I want you to bring David here I want him in my care I 'll notify the police that we 've found him It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital Do you understand
Yes I should think so
HIRSCH Could you get here without any trouble
No not really
HIRSCH Is David acting strangely
No why
HIRSCH Have you read the papers today Have you listened to the radio or television
Yes he is He 's very excited and confused but he 's not crazy if that 's what you mean
HIRSCH The zoo Is he rational
He does n't remember He woke up at the zoo
HIRSCH Is he all right Why did n't you call me Where was he
He 's here
HIRSCH Let 's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
What shall we do
HIRSCH Oh I do n't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon But in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others
Dr Hirsch
HIRSCH David has suffered a severe trauma I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf why should n't David And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf would n't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
Surely you 're not suggesting
No He knows no one in London besides me I should n't have left him alone
HIRSCH You 've absolutely no idea where David might be
HIRSCH I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret I 'm convinced that like David they believe in this werewolf
And what else
HIRSCH They were lying There were no witnesses no escaped lunatic The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there
Yes
HIRSCH I tried to investigate the attack There are no records The case was closed and now they 've 'misplaced the file David 's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he 's no good to us So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things
Dr Hirsch what 's wrong Is this more serious than I know
HIRSCH Warn him
David says Jack comes to warn him
HIRSCH What did he say
Yes
HIRSCH Has his friend appeared to him again
Well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
HIRSCH Alex has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies
He 's not
At my flat I 'm off at midnight and
HIRSCH It 's a full moon Where is he
Yes sir
HIRSCH Oh dear girl your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me I do n't give a damn who you sleep with I 'm concerned about David
HIRSCH Come to my office Miss Price
It 's all right Susan Yes Doctor I have
Yes I believe he did
HIRSCH Did he say a wolf
No sir Of course sir Good day Doctor
HIRSCH The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them He must have been a very powerful man Although I really do n't see that it is any of your concern Miss Price
What happened to them
HIRSCH That would be Jack Goodman the boy who was killed
He said 'Jack
HIRSCH What exactly did he call out
Yes Doctor
HIRSCH Oh Miss Price
Yes Doctor
HIRSCH Go about your duties
Dr Hirsch
HIRSCH Can I be of service Miss Price
HIRSCH Miss Gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
Dr Hirsch Mr Kessler cried out a minute ago
Control What control Get away from me
David do n't lose control
Leave me alone dammit You people are crazy I 've got to get away from here I 've got to do something
David let 's go now
Hopeless It 's hopeless
Will you shut up
Sir he 's very upset His friend was killed and
I swear I do n't know this girl
We had an argument He 's being silly
What
He 's playing a stupid joke sir
Rational I 'm a fucking werewolf for Christ 's sake
David please be rational Let 's go to Dr Hirsch
Jack is dead Look six people have been killed I 'm going to the police
Jack is dead
I am going to the cops There 's a full moon tonight Jack was right I
David stop
Six people mutilated It had to be me Alex
David what are you doing
Pull over
But
I do n't know why I feel so good I have n't felt this good in a long time
Dr Hirsch will know what to do
I should be committed
The next corner we can get a cab
I said goodbye to you I was locked out of the flat I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo I guess I am out of my fucking mind
Do n't you remember
Waking up at the zoo that 's not so insane Having no clothes on That 's insane What did I do last night Alex
The zoo
Alex I 've lost my mind I woke up at the zoo But you know what I feel terrific
I 'm freezing
David Where on earth have you been
See you later
I 'm off There 's food in the fridge
A doper werewolf
I 've left those pills for you
Okay
Listen if you get too anxious call me at the hospital okay
Yeah I do but go to work
David do you want me to stay here tonight
Werewolves simply do not exist
It 's silly of you to be apprehensive
Tell me that it 's silly of me to be apprehensive
Anything
Do me an enormous favor
Let me go now you 'll make me late
That 's good Alex Reassure me
Tomorrow is the full moon
I was n't hallucinating
But David
I was awake and he was in my room
David you do n't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you Do you really
Good
Of course
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes
Yes
Alex
It 's nice to see you
It 's nice to see you
David perhaps you 'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower
There is only one bed
The bedroom
Lovely
Bathroom
Charming
Closet
Very nice
The kitchen
Yeah I would think so too
I would think so
I was dreaming again
What do I think You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends
Yeah He says that I will become a monster in two days What do you think
Your dead friend Jack
My friend Jack was just here
You 're to be discharged tomorrow Will you be all right
I 'll let you know the next full moon
Are you better now
A werewolf
I 'm a werewolf
Good I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room
Now I 'm embarrassed
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then
Forgive me I 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it
You 're being awfully forward are n't you
Not just a patient me
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient
Will you think about it
Now David I said I would keep you company but I meant right here and now
I 'm serious You do n't know me and I know nothing about you We have a perfect relationship
What
Will you come with me
David your dreams will stop You 'll leave England and your bad memories and then this will all fade away
I keep having these really terrible dreams They are getting worse and I ca n't seem to stop them
That 's easy enough
No thank you Just keep me company for a while
Do n't be silly Can I get you something
I 'm sorry I woke you up
Hello You all right
Ahem A Word of Explanation It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about He attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company for he did all the talking We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd

How is that
You put me in an awkward position Mr Kessler

I 'm afraid you have to eat something
I 'm not very hungry thank you
You have n't eaten your lunch

GALLAGHER I looked
Why on earth do you say that
GALLAGHER I think he 's a Jew
Chart says he 's from New York
GALLAGHER He 's an American you know Dr Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him
Yes I should think He called out just now
GALLAGHER He all right
Yes Mrs Hobbs
HOBBS Nothing quite as dramatic as that Miss Price He just does n't eat enough of what is put before him He suffers from nightmares I 'd think he just needs a hand to hold
Has he been refusing food
HOBBS Take these round now will you please The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he 's eaten Will you be sure of that
Yes Mrs Hobbs
HOBBS Miss Price
That 's what I want you to do you moron
You 're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you
Who is this girl
Shakespeare was French The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell Shit Fuck Piss
Now see here young man
Queen Elizabeth is a man Prince Charles is a faggot Winston Churchill was full of shit
There 's no call for that kind of language
Hey you asshole I want you to arrest me
All right you two move along
You did did you
Officer I killed those people last night
Why are you doing this to me
No David Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead The undead
That 's easy for you to say you 're already dead
You 've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf 's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted
Mr Bringsly I 'm sorry I have absolutely no idea what to say to you
This is n't Mr Goodman 's idea He is your good friend whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities
Why are you doing this to me Jack
You could have told them
PLAYER No one brought them here No one wanted them here
That 's very funny that is
PLAYER Oh all right There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York It was full of men from the United Nations
PLAYER No You 've had your chance
Oh come on tell us
PLAYER All right laugh then I sha n't tell it
Quiet everyone Hush Shhh
PLAYER You be quiet woman and let me speak
No but we 're about to
PLAYER Here Gladys Tom Did you hear the one about the crashing plane
GALLAGHER Bambi
Yes but does everyone kill Bambi
GALLAGHER Some everyone does
Do you have bad dreams too
GALLAGHER An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday and I want to see it badly so you give me no problems and go to sleep
What are you going to see
GALLAGHER Miss Price the other nurse that attended you
Alex
GALLAGHER It 's nearly eight I 'm off duty shortly then I 'm off to the films with Alex
What time is it
GALLAGHER Now go back to sleep so you 'll be fresh for Dr Hirsch in the morning
I was having a nightmare
GALLAGHER Mr Kessler Wake up please
HIRSCH Of course not David I 'll fetch in young Miss Price
Dr Hirsch I 'd rather not be by myself
HIRSCH Believe me The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's And if you 'd read the bloody book you 'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud a fake
You really think I 'm crazy do n't you
HIRSCH David please The police are satisfied I 'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we 'd have seen it on the telly
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
HIRSCH I really do n't know
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb
HIRSCH No In fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
Did you see Jack
HIRSCH You 'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
Look Dr Hirsch I know I 've been traumatized but Jack was torn apart I saw him A man ca n't do that to someone with his bare hands
HIRSCH Yes
I 've told you it was n't a man It was an animal A big wolf or something A rabid dog
HIRSCH Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you
Sure as a kid But never so real Never so bizarre
HIRSCH You 've never had bad dreams before
Doctor my memory is fine It 's my sanity I 'm beginning to worry about
HIRSCH In time I 'm sure it will all come back to you
How could there have been witnesses It was so dark We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere I do n't understand what they 're talking about
HIRSCH So they said
There were witnesses
HIRSCH Now we 've just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now Miss Price will see to your needs Rest now
Lunatic
HIRSCH You 've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while You 'll have some dueling scars to boast of That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow They say a mad man has the strength of ten
Two weeks
HIRSCH You 've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
How long have I been here
Get your fucking hands off me What the hell is going on here
HIRSCH Miss Price Miss Price please
HIRSCH Now David I want you to prepare yourself your friend is dead
The guy I was with Is he all right How did I get to London
HIRSCH I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
London Where 's Jack I had a strange dream
HIRSCH You 're in a hospital in London
Where am I
HIRSCH Hello David I am Dr Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours Mr Collins
If you did it wrong it would be painful You 'd choke to death
I could hang myself
How shall I do it
Because this must be stopped
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway We thought it best you did n't see him as he 's a fresh kill and still pretty messy
Hello
David Kessler this is Gerald Bringsly
I want you to meet some people
Well even if I 'm not the wolfman I am crazy enough to do something like that I mean here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse I 'm glad to see you Jack
What about the zoo
I did n't mean it I do n't know what I 'm saying I 'm not even sure it was me who killed those people I do n't remember doing it
Thank you
You look awful
If I was still alive I probably would
Are n't you going to say I told you so
You do n't have to say anything
What can I say Jack
Hi David
Hi Jack
I will not accept this Now go away
The canines will be real You 'll taste real blood God damit David please believe me You 'll kill and make others like me I 'm not having a nice time David Do n't allow this to happen again You must take your own life
What Jack That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I 'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people Bullshit
You must believe me
I think I 've lost my mind I think you 're not real I think I 'm asleep and you 're a part of another bad dream
What do you think
Jack are you really dead
You must take your own life now David before it 's too late
A monster I know I know
David tomorrow night is the full moon You 'll change you 'll become
Get out of here Jack
Yes
I understand all right You 're one of the undead and I 'm a werewolf
David I 'm sorry I upset you yesterday but you must understand what is going on
Okay you 've seen me Now go away
I wanted to see you
What are you doing here
Do n't be an asshole David Come here
You 're not real
It 's cold David and I 'm so alone The undead surround me Have you ever talked to a corpse It 's boring I 'm lonely Kill yourself David before you kill others
Nurse Oh God Alex
The supernatural The powers of darkness It 's all true Take your own life Suicide David Join me
Nurse
Listen to me Take your own life David It 's our only chance
Nurse
David please believe me You will kill people David You 've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins
You 're talking like Boris Karloff It 's movie dialogue
You 'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night
Jack please go away Please go away
Beware the moon The full moon David You 've got two days
Stop it Jack
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said 'Beware the moon
What are you talking about I wo n't accept this Get out God damit
You survived and now you shall continue the curse
What
It 's you David
Will you be quiet
The wolf 's bloodline must be severed The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
What 's wrong with you Shut up
I was murdered an unnatural death and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf 's curse is lifted
Shut up you zombie
On the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
I 'm not listening
We were attacked by a werewolf
If you love me so much Jack you 'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one 's breakfast with the living dead
I 'm a grisly sight it 's true but I love you and that 's why I 'm here You 've got to know
Warn me Will you get out of here you meat loaf
David now I know this may be hard for you but I have to warn you
What
David
I 'm going completely crazy
Life mocks me even in death
Rudy Levine the shmuck
So you know what she does She 's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine 's bed
I ca n't stand it
Debbie Klein cried a lot
Why should you be surprised You were a very well-liked person
Yeah Your parents came to my funeral I was surprised at how many people came
Are n't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace
I 'm sorry to be upsetting you David but I had to come
Hurting your feelings Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me Listen to me I 'm talking to a hamburger
David You 're hurting my feelings
I 'm aware that I do n't look so great but I thought you 'd be glad to see me
This is too much I ca n't handle this
Thanks a lot
Get the fuck out of here Jack
Nice to see you
Are you going to help me up
You really scared me you shithead
Well I 'm glad we WHOAA
I 'll tell you when we get there
Where are we going
Yeah
Jack
Not far enough Come on
It sounds far away
No
See anything
Walking away yes sir Here we are walking away
Walk away Jack
Nice doggie Good boy
A sheep dog or something Turn slowly and let 's walk away
Oh shit What is that
Do you think it 's a dog
It 's in front of us
Let 's just keep walking
Plan
What 's the plan
It 's circling us
It 's moving
Anywhere I think we should just keep moving
Come on where
I do n't know Come on
Shit David what is that
Yeah
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb
It 's a full moon 'beware the moon
No but he was on the moors
Heathcliffe did n't howl
Heathcliffe
Pecos Bill
The Hound of the Baskervilles
There are n't any coyotes in England
A coyote
Yeah
Could be a lot of things
What was it
I heard that
Did you hear that
I 'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you
Say David
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
I have no idea
What do you think was wrong
Well not quite a blood-thirsty mob
I do n't know Now that we 're out here and it 's three degrees I 'm not so sure I would n't rather face a blood-thirsty mob
That was weird I guess leaving was the best idea
Come on I 'm freezing
Beware the moon
I do n't know Let 's see if there 's an inn or something up the road
What the hell was that all about
Apparently so
Come on Jack shall we go
What do you mean I 'm starving
Jack we 'd better go
You ask them
Go on ask them
Wrong
Right
I see You want me to ask these people if they 're burning candles to ward off monsters
Listen that 's a pentangle a five pointed star It 's used in witchcraft Lon Chaney Jr and Universal Studios maintain it 's the mark of the wolf man
You ask them
Ask them what the candles are for
Maybe the owners are from Texas
It 's a five-pointed star
What about it
Look at that
Listen at least it 's warm in here
Nice looking group
Nice to see you
Hello
Shall we
Okay
I assume full responsibility
David before we go in there I want you to know that no matter what happens to us it 's your fault
A severed wolf 's head on a pike as their symbol
That 's not a spear It 's a pike
Of course The Slaughtered Lamb Why else would they have a severed wolf 's head on a spear as their symbol
That 's a wolf 's head
Of course The Slaughtered Lamb Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
The Slaughtered Lamb
She says she 'likes me too much
We 've known Debbie what since the eighth grade How many years of foreplay is that
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
I have to make love to her It 's very simple She has no choice really
If you do n't stop I 'm going to kill you
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein The love affair that shocked Europe See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican Never has the screen dared
I do n't know
Well anyway do you think she 'll be there
I 'm talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
You 're talking about the woman I love
She 's a jerk
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body
Do you think she 'll meet me in Rome
Right
I 'm sorry Northern England first Italy later
Well I like it here
Oh I do n't know I mean look around Is n't this a fun place
You 're not having a good time are you
David
Jack
Good
Yes
Are you cold
VILLIERS Stay here If we need you we 'll know where to reach you
HIRSCH What can we do to assist you
HIRSCH Regardless of what you think Lieutenant the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him
VILLIERS The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved that 's true but I hardly think
HIRSCH Why do n't we ask him
VILLIERS Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
HIRSCH You were saying
HIRSCH Well then what can I do for Scotland Yard
VILLIERS No thank you Doctor
HIRSCH Come in come in Please sit Some tea
VILLIERS Dr Hirsch
HIRSCH Tell him I 'm out No tell him I 've passed away An old war wound or something Tell him I 'm dead And no more calls
He 's on the telephone
HIRSCH What here
Roger Mathison Doctor
HIRSCH Excuse me Yes
HIRSCH Send them in
Lt Villiers and Sgt McManus are here to see you Doctor
HIRSCH Yes
HIRSCH I see You 've heard nothing about the incident
Oh that 's been there for two hundred years We were going to paint it out but it 's traditional so we left it
HIRSCH What 's that
HIRSCH I suppose Guinness will suffice
Sorry love
HIRSCH Campari and soda would do nicely
Hello there What can I get you
I beg your pardon
Remember the Alamo
But I can heat some up for you if you 'd like
Oh
No
Then you have some hot tea
We 've got spirits and beer If it 's something hot you want you can have tea
Hot chocolate
No
Do you have any hot soup
MCMANUS We 'll find him not to worry
VILLIERS I can not accept a connection between David Kessler and last night 's murders We will find him however I can assure you of that
VILLIERS That is precisely my point David as far as we are concerned the matter is closed We wo n't trouble you any further Good day
MCMANUS I do n't rightly know sir
VILLIERS And what Sergeant
MCMANUS Lieutenant the boy seems pretty lucid to me and
VILLIERS Sgt McManus are you suggesting that David and Jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police We have two witnesses to the crime You 'll forgive me Mr Kessler if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
MCMANUS He may have a point Lieutenant Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man
VILLIERS Has Mr Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
MCMANUS Sorry
MCMANUS I 'd like some tea please
VILLIERS No thank you
Yeah sure
Yes sure
If she ca n't pay I 'll have to foreclose wo n't I
Why not
She 's a widow I do n't like taking mortgages from widows
What 's the idea of turning her down It sounds like a perfectly safe investment
But listen Tom I
I 'll tell you why I do n't like the crowd you 're mixed up with Personally you can have all the credit you want But for that deal not a cent
Tom I never had trouble getting credit from you before When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted Now I come to you with a swell deal and the greatest
I want to know why
Listen I told you I was n't interested in that deal did n't I
What do you suppose anybody wants Money money money
You here again What do you want
Hello Tom
Yeah
He has
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson 's office
Yeah He 'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one
Matt
Where 's Matt
No kidding When I saw it you could a knocked me over with a pin
No kidding
I was the first one to see it I was coming down the stairs and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet
Oscar what 's the matter
Say do n't annoy me I got troubles of my own
And listen wise guy I 'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock so no squawks out of you guys in the morning
Yeah
I remember once when your account checked
I 'm fourteen cents out and it took me half an hour to find the mistake And me with a date too
What 's the matter Charlie
Where do you think I 've been I took the baby for a stroll in the park
Where you been
Aw nerts
Say pal did you ever hear of a Depression
It 'll be yours if you do n't kick in with that ten bucks
Whose death
Baby I ca n't give you anything but love
I 'll pay it back to you Saturday on the level I will Give a guy a break will you I 've got to get it back in my account If Helen ever finds out that I
Yeah
Charlie
Ten bucks Say if I had ten bucks I 'd quit
Let me have ten bucks
Yeah
Say do me a favor will you Charlie
Here 's twenty-five thousand
Yeah
It was more than that last week
About twenty-four thousand
How much
Say Matt I 'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls
Yes sir
And tell him not to delay
Yes sir
When he comes in tell him we 're waiting for him in the board room
Not yet Mr Clark
Mr Dickson in yet
All right let him I 'm sick and tired of hearing about him If he wants to run the bank let him do it I do n't want any part of it
You know Dickson as well as we do He 'll shut the doors before he gives up control
Take it easy Clark
How are you protecting your depositors By making a lot of idiotic loans
What good will that do Why it will take control away from him We 'll put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again That 's what good it will do
What good will that do
Dickson does n't have to go But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Do n't make me laugh Schultz
Oh is he We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city We 're fools to tolerate it
Personally I think you 're getting panic-stricken about nothing Dickson 's all right
You know what you can do with that Come on take a look at this You 'll see a demonstration of faith that 's worth more than all the collateral in the world
We 've been waiting fifteen minutes
Come out here you pawnbrokers take a look at this
The bank All right Do anything you want with it
Dickson I 'd like to talk to you about the bank
I ca n't You just wait and see If that run does n't stop within the next hour I 'll shut the doors You know what that means The bank examiner will step in tomorrow You 'll be forced to liquidate I 'll insist upon it The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar What 's left you gentlemen can have But I 'll guarantee there wo n't be enough to pay your next month 's garage bill
Say you ca n't do that
So that 's it eh You 've waited a long time for this chance have n't you Well I 'm not going to resign now or ever
No You ca n't reason with anyone else when you 're in a jam We pleaded with you to keep liquid but you would n't listen to us You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish Now you want our help You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you 've wrecked All right There 's one way you can get it Give us an option on your stock and resign as president
Aw they 've gone crazy You ca n't reason with a mob
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you You thought they were your friends Why do n't you go out there now and try and get some help from them
I have everything I own in it It 's your bank as well as mine is n't it
That sounds very simple Dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
I know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city Get that money over here and I 'll stop this run within five minutes
What do you mean help
We 'll be forced to shut the doors I 've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive You 've all made money out of it Are you willing to help
We 'll discuss that in the board room
What about
We want to talk to you
Yes You said it Clark That 's the only thing that means anything to me
Gentlemen you notice Mr Dickson refuses to consider our wishes He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as as faith
I 'm running this bank my way Get that clear
I know Dickson That 's all very well But you 're taking too many chances In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble In case of emergency
Most of the creditors I know personally I 've seen them grow up in the community I knew their fathers and mothers before them
Not at all That 's Alexander Hamilton 's idea 5 the finest banking mind this country has ever known Those are his exact words gentlemen Character It 's the only thing you can bank on and it 's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
Character hmmpf That 's your idea
Just pure luck
What 's the matter with my policy How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years I 'll tell you Not a single one What 's wrong with that kind of banking
Oh you would eh All right If it 's more important than golf go ahead What 's on your mind
I think Mr Dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you do n't mind
Say you know I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball You 've got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out it 's the only way you can hit anything
He wo n't believe it Mr Dickson But it 's the truth honest it is I was in my apartment last night ask your wife she
Claims he was there with a married woman Does n't want to mention her name
I did n't kill him I had nothing to do with that I tell you I was home in my apartment last night I can prove it
Do n't forget there 's a dead watchman downstairs
I was crazy I tell you Mr Dickson I did n't know what I was doing I wandered around in a daze All I could think of was that they were going to kill me You 'll stand by me wo n't you Mr Dickson You wo n't go back on me now will you I 'll die if they send me to prison
They took my keys yesterday I went there to get them back
What were you doing at Finlay 's this morning
Stand back Inspector Let me out of here or I 'll shoot you
Do n't be a fool Cluett This is only going to make it worse for you
All right Jack all right
Stand back Inspector or I 'll shoot Drop that gun
It 's one of the boys from headquarters He always sings Mother Machree whenever he 's got good news Looks like this case 'll be settled in no time
Somebody must be in good humor He was humming Mother Machree
Thanks
Why of course
You understand
Oh
If you do n't mind Inspector I 'd rather not say that is unless it becomes absolutely essential You see she 's married
Looks like you 're going to have no trouble at all What was the lady 's name Mr Cluett
Oh yes of course There was someone with me A lady
That is simple is n't it I assume you can prove that if necessary
That 's very simple I was home
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night
Of course yes Just what would you like to know Inspector
I hope you do n't mind me asking you a few questions Mr Cluett
Get out get out
She was n't to blame Mr Dickson It was n't her fault Honest it was n't I begged her to come up She didn't
She just came up for a drink Just for a few minutes
You just mentioned her name What was she doing there What was she doing in your apartment
Nothing nothing Mr Dickson Do n't pay any attention to me I do n't know what I 'm saying
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night
But I did n't kill that man last night Honest I did n't Mr Dickson
Fifty thousand dollars
Gambling I owed them a lot of money Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars
What happened You 're not a thief How 'd you get mixed up with these kind of people
I do n't know It 's all been like a crazy nightmare Mr Dickson
Confessed Cluett in heaven 's name what got into you
Listen buddy you 're getting by pretty easy Quit squawking
But Dude listen could n't we make this some other time
Be sure you 're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked Understand
know but
You No you 'll be all right so long as you establish an alibi for tonight
Dude there 's not any chance of my becoming involved in this is there
All you got ta do is fix a few things for us and we 'll do the rest see
What do you mean
You do n't have to do nothing
Why I could n't do that
Why not
Good heavens man You 're not suggesting that I
We can take blood from anything  If it 's comin to us
But after all you ca n't take blood from a stone
That do n't do us any good
I 'm sorry Dude butI
Then what did you want to gamble for If you 'd have beat us out of fifty G 's you 'd have been paid would n't you Well we want our dough
I have n't got it
That 's your funeral We 've got fifty thousand dollars comin to us
I know I know Dude Oh I must have been crazy I lost my head completely
You know what we do to welchers Cluett do n't you
What are you doing here
DICKSON Why Matt
I 'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here
DICKSON I 'm not afraid of you You have n't got a moustache
And now fair woman I have you in my power
A misunderstood bachelor
DICKSON What is that Mr Bones 7
Oh you 're not so badly off There 's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife
DICKSON You know there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you America 's comfort to misunderstood wives I never thought I would find myself in that class
Good for you Come on
DICKSON No No I 'm afraid papa is n't that much interested He 's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy old speeches at stuffy old bankers meetings Too busy closing big important deals I think I will have a drink
What 's the matter Afraid papa will spank
DICKSON No I know the answer to that one I think you 'd better take me home
Come on up for just a few minutes We 'll have just one drink then we 'll go
DICKSON I knew I could n't trust you You told me you were taking me home
My apartment
DICKSON What 's this
DICKSON Cyril
No No I 'm not I deliberately avoided you I was afraid of making a fool of myself But I wo n't stand it any longer
DICKSON Why Cyril you 're insane
I 've loved you ever since I can remember long before you married Tom Dickson
DICKSON Now wait a minute wait a minute
Do n't you know I 've been crazy about you for years
DICKSON What
I want to be near you
DICKSON No
Do n't you know
DICKSON Why are you so anxious
No they wo n't Not when you are there Oh please be a sport Please ask me
DICKSON Do n't be silly Cyril These are respectable people They 'd probably bore you to death
Now Phyllis if you do n't invite me I 'm coming anyway
DICKSON You No can do It 's all set Just a few of Tom 's closest friends
Well are n't you going to invite me
DICKSON Well what

All right That 's all Please Matt
Aw I do n't know what you 're talking about All I know is that you 're losing your bank and
She was was n't she How long has this been going on Do you know
Well uh I
Wait a minute Answer my question Was Mrs Dickson there
Listen Mr Dickson do n't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down You 've got more friends than anybody in this town Little guys guys who would n't be in business if it were n't for you All you 've got to do is
Was Mrs Dickson there
Oh I can explain about that later You 're losing your bank do n't you realize what that means
Were you in Cluett 's apartment
You 're not giving up are you Mr Dickson
Why would n't you tell me where you were last night
We have n't got much time left Mr Dickson We 've got to do something quick or it 'll be too late
Yes you are You 're protecting somebody Now listen it does n't make any difference who it is It ca n't be as important as this Now come on tell me Where were you last night Come on do n't be a fool Matt you trust me do n't you
No I 'm not Mr Dickson
You 're protecting somebody
No I wo n't
I ca n't tell you
Wait a minute Wait a minute Matt do you realize you 're up against something You 're being charged with murder It 's serious son Now come on I know you did n't do it But we 've got to make them believe it Come on tell the truth where were you last night
There you are
I already told him I was home
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too eh
Well I
Aw go on forget it You came through did n't you That 's all I wanted A lot of them did n't think you would You do n't know how much satisfaction it 's been to me It 's been swell Well when are you and Helen going to get married
Aw I 'm sorry Mr Dickson It 's just kind of sudden that 's all Sure I 'm excited I think it 's great Only well you 've done so much for me already I 'll never be able to thank you enough
Say come on Show a little enthusiasm What 's the matter Are you sick or something Go on fake it even if it is n't real
Sure I think it 's swell
What 's the matter You do n't seem very excited about it
And what 's more keep up the good work and who knows some day you 'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk Not a bad thought eh
It 's all right Thanks
You do n't want to check up on anybody I 'll do all the checking up Wait a minute
Do n't worry Mr Dickson We 'll find out whether he 's telling the truth I 'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away
You 're lying
No wonder he did n't want to mention her name
My wife What 's she got to do with you
He 's just confessed He 's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town
Why you must be crazy I 've known this man for years
You were right Mr Dickson Brown did n't have anything to do with it Here 's your man
Listen Matt If you do n't tell the truth I ca n't help you Where were you last night
Of course it 's true and he knows it
So have you So have I So 's everybody got a record What difference does that make You ca n't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
Maybe But I 'm taking no chances Why this kid 's got a record
What are you talking about He had no more to do with it than you did
All I know is the bank 's been robbed and a murder 's been committed The way I see it Brown here looks guilty
Good You 've got nothing to worry about Soon as the report comes in you 'll be released And listen do n't talk so loud Take it easy Coast a little
That 's what he says I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now
Why certainly he can Matt now all you 've got to do is tell them where you were last night between twelve and twelve-thirty and everything will be all right
If he can do it yes
All right If the boy proves an alibi he 's all right is n't he
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09
What time did this thing happen
Yes
It 's an inside job That 's a cinch Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout Now Brown here is in charge of the vaults is n't he
Why pick on him
I 'm afraid I must Mr Dickson
What 's the matter What 's going on here This is ridiculous You ca n't hold this boy on a vague suspicion
I hate to do this but I 've got to have time to dig up some help I think I know where I can get some real cash Snap into it Sampson We will lick this thing yet
Yes sir
Get all the big bills in the place Take them out and get them changed Get nothing but ones and fives Distribute them among the tellers Tell them to take their time Stall as much as possible Count and recount the money
Mr Dickson Mr Dickson
Do n't you think I know it
We ca n't keep open till four o'clock We have n't cash enough to last an hour
I 'll talk to them Listen go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said Tell 'em to verify every signature
What 'll we do
The fools If they only knew it they 're making things worse for themselves Somebody starts a silly rumor and they lose their heads
Yes sir But soon as our money runs out they 'll mob the place
Mine too
Yes sir
Did you get the case for the securities
Look at them Mr Dickson They 're going crazy
Yes sir
The bank 's reputation would n't be worth a nickel after that This is just a flurry that 's all They 've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken Listen get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash Wait a minute Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot
We have n't much on hand you know If it gets any worse I hope we do n't have to close the doors
All right Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away
They 've been coming in steady all morning I have called for some extra police
What are you talking about
The lobby 's half filled now
Yes sir
How about his nights He 's too busy running around Tell him to keep tomorrow night open come in and sign this thing or I 'll call this whole deal off
He says he ca n't get away in the daytime
That 's just exactly what he has been doing This deal should have been closed weeks ago Tell him to keep tomorrow open
I 'm afraid he 's been stalling
Good I 'll take this along with me Tell Clyde I 'll see him tomorrow I 'm sick and tired of the delay
Here 's the data on the Clyde deal
Well Sampson what is it
Please lady Please be quiet Everything will be all right Open up here folks All right folks please
But you said it would be safe It 's his life insurance money Oh please I 'll go to the Old Ladies Home if you do n't do something please
Quiet down please Take it easy folks Everything will be all right
It 's his life insurance money you know
Absolutely
Is it safe
Yes ma'am you can deposit your money here
All right
DICKSON Oh well I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite When he comes out you tell him I 'll be back He has n't gotten rid of me
Hardly
DICKSON Well take my word for it and do n't try it It 's useless If it were some other woman I could handle her but after all you ca n't scratch a bank 's eyes out now can you
No
DICKSON Helen did you ever try competing with a bank
I 'm afraid so
DICKSON Board meeting Oh that means hours I suppose
He 's at a board meeting
DICKSON Is that busy husband of mine busy
How-do-you-do Mrs Dickson
Matt look There 's Mr Jones
The big guys have got the screws on him You 've got to come through for him Mr Conway He came through for you a hundred times If his friends do n't help him who is going to help him
Mr Williams

Yeah I got an idea Come on let 's get to a telephone

You 've got enough
I 'm okay Matt
How are you fixed
Okay Matt
You 're carrying too much money on you Hank You better turn some in tonight
Now you tell us
TOM Sometimes a wound will kill
This is healing
Jim Younger I told you
TOM I could n't lose him
Tom I 'm this close to coming with you
TOM I think I may just go on to the reservation
TOM I said like a Comanche not this Comanche
You can ride like that
It 's tougher than it looks
He 's not bad at it
Things changed when you quit the gang For example I 'm now the one who says Let 's ride
You 're just upset about Jesse We all are
I 'm sorry Cole
Swear on Jimmy 's grave
I swear
Swear
Bob I did n't
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
I ai n't done
What have you done
How 'd they
Leave me alone Bob
Cole we 're outlaws Not exactly the most respectable job if you know what I mean
As long as people think Jesse 's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
That was because of the reputation the gang had
It 's still taking too long The people used to snap to
This is the best score yet
What
That 's what the newspapers say Were n't for Jesse James this gang would n't be able to find a goat 's ass with a stick
Frankly yes I 'm feeling a little left out
We got a problem here brother
Say we bust into a bank We yell We 're the Younger-James Gang People are gon na be thinking The younger James Gang Is there an older James Gang How come we never heard of the older James gang So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms
How
No Jimmy has a point The Younger-James Gang could be confusing
You stay out of this Bob
Uhh yeah it does
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys
Our place Clell Miller 's Sammy Johnston the Creeders Will Hite
Zee I 'm pleased you came
Here 's Liberty 's favorite son I 'll never forget what you did cousin
That was two hours ago
Your Ma would n't let us leave until we ate something
Anywhere nobody 's shooting at me is pretty
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty
Never a good thing
He 's smiling
Dammit this stopped being fun about two years ago
Gatling They 've got a Gatling
Tomorrow
The Army can hang him
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior
Damn
He just lost his temper a little
Oh no
They came up made the same offer they made you folks Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off one of those detectives hit him in the head knocked him out Cole lost his temper
Stop by our spread after that tell our Ma we 're all right We 'll go to Doc Mimms
Cole I want to get to the farm make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay
Will Perry
Jesus mercy that 's Charlie Higgins Dave Laller
Then I love it
Nope
Corn gon na shoot at me
Well somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES
Yesterday
I can hit those boys from here We just need a distraction
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine thank you
Tell me
Listen he 's my brother and I do n't want to start trouble
What
He 's planning a job
He 's been full of vinegar lately
Listen Jesse we 've got a problem It 's Cole
You are a fine figure of a man
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here
Yes I am obviously not standing out in people 's minds at the robberies
This is about the Wanted Posters is n't it
You heard me Jesse You know how crazy I get
Beg pardon
One false move and I 'll blow your heads off
Okay folks I think we know how this is going to go
Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars
Hey
The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk
We oughta take some of this give it to our neighbors in Liberty Lot of people hurting up there
Well no Jesse it was the bank 's That 's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it You explain it to him
All right settle down All this money ai n't ours
Exactly
But if we take their money and supplies
Not yet But I 'm hoping
You have no shame
Two
How many of them did he kill
Best damn plan I heard all war
Home We go home We ride like hell to get there and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again
No really You 're wife said she needed some help seeing as you were so fat you could n't find your
DETECTIVE You shut up now boy
I think I saw you leavin by the front door just as I was coming in the back
DETECTIVE How
I think I recognize you
DETECTIVE What you sayin boy
You ya barrel of pork lard Here piggy piggy
DETECTIVE What
We did n't Zerelda did Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw
Where 'd you get all these riders
Pff All we been through the thought never crossed my mind
You know you gettin caught right after leaving us some people thought
Missed you too cousin
Missed you cousin
Who 's next You Me Bob
WHAT We follow you for a year and now that our blood 's been spilled you 're gon na quit
I 'm out
We 'll make them pay for this
Pass me some whisky
Bob rip up some bandages
Clell Tom go get Doc Mimms in Liberty
Okay you 're gon na rest here
A trap
Dammit
You 'll be smiling once you 've got all that money to spend cousin Cole Younger 's going to make everybody rich
Fine We hit this bank
Then let me run the show General Lee
Still smells fishy
And I 'm the better outlaw
I 'm the better soldier Jesse
That 's it
And almost got hanged in peacetime
I got us through the War all right
A bad idea
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea
Beautiful
You 're forgetting who 's in charge
I 've robbed just as many banks as you have I know this town and I know this bank and I say it 's an easy job
What are you saying
If you 'd read about it first you 'd have no problems
Smells funny it being mentioned in the paper
What will be
It 'll be the biggest score yet
Hold on hold on we all know Bob is an important part of the gang
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity
Why are n't we the Younger-James Gang I mean there 's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here
Yep
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the James-Younger Gang
Sure cousin
Jesse we got to have a word
Twenty
The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men
It 's better It 's a construction depot They 'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take That way we can take on a bigger job
It 's not a bank
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words does n't make him smart
See Frank 's being smart about this
I got three
I got seven thousand
Do n't let it happen again
Sorry
The James-Younger Gang
Let 's ride
Perfect Cole
I 'll pick the first job I mean I know a girl down at the bank See if she ca n't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money
Just like in the war Harass their supply lines We kill the railroad 's men they wo n't care
So what do we do General Lee
This is n't a feud this is war They 've got more men than we do We kill detectives they can replace 'em in a day
Yeah
Because we were good at it Hell we were great at it Jesse do n't tell anyone I said this because everybody knows I 'm the toughest man in this town but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns
But it was a whole lot of killing Why should we miss that
It was exciting
The war What are you crazy There are things I miss about it
After all you did on our farm You miss it do n't you Jesse
Thanks for the help
All right calm down I 'll agree Sadie was a woman
She was European
She had a moustache
She got two of them
You ever notice Zerelda 's eyes
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches I do n't want them to see us coming
What is wrong with you
Not now
Pick your fights cousin You taught me that
You 're not scared are you
Hands off your hip Cole
Planting corn Harvesting corn Year after year
Home boys Back to our farms
There 's Yankees back there Lot 's of 'em
Where you boys going
Suit yourself We 'll have some horses waiting for you at the road Let 's ride Rangers
I could use the walk
Ride with me cousin
What 's going on
'Bout time you got here buddy
TOM I 'm thinking
Well
TOM Hmm Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack or work for you
Tom why do n't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation Figure we might have some work for you if you want
TOM You ride like a Comanche
Wait 'll we get back to Missouri start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself
TOM You pay me to find you Bluecoats There they are
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be Tom
They 're just insurance in case we run
They gon na rush us
Another dozen out back
Cole he did n't mean that
Oh you 're in charge We ai n't partners any more Jesse You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride
Jesse
Exactly Because this is a war
Strategically
Hey We decide something that 's it We 're in this for the long haul and this idea of me and Jesse 's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin up on us in our sleep We 've got to think
Get buckets
BASTARDS Come back here and face me
Ah
Shakespeare He 's European
I have no idea what you just said but it sounded real nice
Sadie was not a man
Oh Lord the dance hall girl at Bunty 's
The brown one
Which one right or left
I think one of 'em 's glass
Must be a garrison in town We 're in occupied territory boys
What the
Soon as I hit one the other 'll know and beat us up
Both would be nice
Cannon or Gatling
All right all right Jesse James never yelled at folk
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE
This here is the Younger Gang
Where is Jesse James
What
Of course Uh sir
The safe Now
TOM Me get heap firewater
Go ahead to the saloon But do n't get too drunk
TOM Ho-yah

TOM You 'um big lawman
TOM I 'd appreciate that
MAN Fine I 'll just wait here
TOM It 's a secret
MAN Oh Why did n't you just say so
TOM On account of we 're robbing it
MAN Then why ca n't I go in there
TOM You 're right sir
MAN I know it ai n't no durned bank holiday
Shit
I had you covered From back there
Where the hell were you
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody
So
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank
What is it
What the
MIMMS It 's fine by me Jesse
Yesss but I was thinking I could come by and then take Zee out Some place near With other folk Near Here But out
MIMMS You know you 're welcome any time
MIMMS Go on You 're pretty much all healed up
What do you say sir
Go home Doc They ai n't gon na hang no more Liberty boys
MIMMS Boys
Died a hero
MIMMS Web died fighting
Pff He jumped his horse clear over our heads killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them
MIMMS My little Web did that
rode right into them screaming like a banshee
MIMMS I 'm upset too Zee but Jesse and Cole know what they 're doing I 'm sure they wo n't press their luck
He thinks this is some kind of game
I think he 's already feeling better
MIMMS Well I hope the boy pulls through We should know in the morning
I fooled them into thinking I was alone
MIMMS They 're gone What are you
MIMMS The bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood Praying would n't hurt
He 's going to be fine right Daddy
MIMMS Zerelda it 's no coincidence The railroad men come through offering to buy up land Nobody sells Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason
Daddy do n't start with this again
Hell they hardly even noticed us
See you soon Oh and I appreciate the distraction back there
I 'll meet you down there in a few weeks
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
A war against the railroad What the hell were we thinking
Yeah
You 're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know
Railroad burned him out too You could n't have stopped him
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West How was he supposed to say no to that
Jim was old enough
Shoulda learned with Web Made it look fun made it look like an adventure Got Web killed Now Jim
Got any ideas little brother
They 're all pinned down Ca n't even get to the door
No I
You taking sides against me now Frank
Just do me a favor Think about what this is costing everybody Not just the railroad
Oh yeah
We 're drunk
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee
What do you want me to say Frank I was killing men when I was fifteen I like getting shot at I like riding out of town with a posse at my back This is a helluva better life than farming
Maybe it started out that way But now
We 're doing this for Ma
I ca n't quit and leave you alone I ca n't quit until you quit Ma would 've wanted it that way
That 's a lie You could 've bought a dozen farms with the money we 've stolen
If I could go back to farming
You 've killed your fair share of men
It got to you did n't it All the killing in the war You need it now
And we 're good at it
Jesse we 're outlaws
This has been a good year
Bob here 'll kill a man for sneezing and he 's the best shot in the gang
Pardon the delay folks but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control
The posters
Bob 's upset
Gents we are in the middle of something here
It 's the scientific method It 's all the rage
I do n't think it 's counterfeit Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives
And it 's guarded by Pinkerton detectives
And that 's why you both lead the gang Two of you went into that bank together right
And I planned getting you off the hangman 's deck
We 're gon na have to talk
Fine How 'd it go out here
How 'd it go in there
Make a thousand of 'em Still wo n't be enough by the time I 'm through
Did n't think you would I 'm going to go make the coffin
Do n't care
We could move on Rebuild Make a decent life someplace else
Ma
Pinkertons It 's the railroad
Shut up Uh Doc I was wondering if uh this evening I could come by
You 're looking a bit more spry now that somebody
Would you get in the carriage Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself she 's gon na make me miserable
What do you think
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming
Damn All that reading paid off
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed The railroad does n't even need our land they 're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can
Heard of him
You know him
Your Zee Hmm From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive they sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world
if you stop saying things about my Zee
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back
She 's still talking to Jesus
Next time try fat and haggard
I swear I 'll shoot you in your sleep
You are a charmer
You can shut up now
Big and older
Maybe maybe
That just might work
What kind of story are they going to believe
Think about this If we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
All we thought about was coming home I swore I 'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay fine by me
Saved all our lives Doc None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms Doc God 's honest truth
Whyyyy he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself
Zee we got to talk to you and your father
You 're doing just fine
Frank do n't you have something to say
We better go to Doc 's see what 's going on here
Looks like Web Mimms was n't the only casualty this town 's got
All this time in the saddle We get to the farm I 'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle
Hello Liberty Missoura
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
Hell of a war
I reckoned
Web 's dead
No Jesse your problem is you 're always doing stuff before I 'm finished figuring it out
See that 's your problem Frank By the time you finish figuring out stuff I 'm already finished doing it
I figure
That would have made an impression
You could have worn one of those big floppy woman 's Easter Sunday hats
Such as
Mm-hmm
So you 're saying I could have done more to attract their attention
Pff They hardly even noticed you
Distracting enough for you
So we got a plan
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling they try to shoot it off
Everything but the boring parts
How much of that story is true
Yeah Jimmy
Uncle Frank
I think he was just a real interestin fella to have around
So what was he
Ca n't argue that
But he killed a lot of men too
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad
They 're making him a hero now
That he was
Sounds like he was a hell of a man
Allow a man his version of the past When you get to be my age you 've got enough painful memories you 're allowed to soften a few of the edges up
I know But that 's how it should have ended Your Dad and Mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy
every time you tell that story you stop there That 's not how it ended I was five when my dad got shot
Yeah Jimmy
Y'know Uncle Frank
Shush
Doc Mimms will
Take care of each other boys You say your prayers
We know Ma Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms
Riders
Boys
Ma Please
Somebody 's in a vengeful smiting mood today
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard nobody 'll ever find them
We 're just fine thank you sir
Easterners
He 's a good Christian and he killed Yankees Jesus told me that made him an all right boy
Ma I 'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend
Say your prayers
A fair number Ma
Did you kill Yankees
I 'll explain on the way
Tennessee
Yes ma'am
Do n't swear
You are a hell of a woman
I ca n't believe I had to blow up a train for you
Yes ma'am
You get arrested again I 'll kill you
If you do n't see it it 's not real
What
Do n't turn around
Swimming Swimming is good
Stop it This is just sad
Aw shucks ma'am
Jesse have you ever noticed that when you 're trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy
Now sweetie y'all would n't go believing one of them silly dime novels would you
Oh I 'm not finished When he sauntered into a saloon his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple As I said Hmm
Let me see that
Blazing Guns of the West True Stories of Jesse James Only a dime in the hotel lobby
I beg your pardon
But the life of the James Gang was n't all robbing and shooting and killing for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James
Hmm what
Hmm
Now wait a minute There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding
I 've got you You keep me busy I figure we 'll get over to the hotel get checked in cleaned up then I 'd like to do something I 've been thinking about for a long time
Are you going to be happy here Mr James Without all that excitement
That 's why I picked it We can start a whole new life down here
I would never have imagined us in a place like this
She 's beautiful Smart And has the biggest buck teeth in all of Missouri
That 's wonderful It 's just I thought
She 's the most wonderful woman in the world Ca n't get her out of my mind
I do n't understand
I had to see you I 'm getting married
Jesse What are you thinking There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
Zee
When my name makes them cry in their sleep When I 've brought them to ashes
Whose justice Yours or God 's When will you stop
Laws do n't touch men like Thaddeus Rains Only justice does
Let the law
Me neither
You and I we 've started something you know I do n't know what 'll happen if you do this
Frank and me have to go away for a while
I am so sorry Jesse
I 've been planning on kissin you for a very long time
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting
Yep
Is this one of Frank 's Shakespeare poems you 're trying to quote
Little ones
Sparkling rocks
Ahem From this doctrine No ah From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive they sparkle still like shiny sparkling rocks
Honestly you 'd do if only you had the buck teeth
Where will you find such a girl
Smart Funny Bossy Always makes me think she 's two steps ahead of me And big buck teeth
And what 's this right girl like
Not if I find the right girl
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life Jesse James
Mostly It would be an all right life for a bachelor
Thank God you grew out of that You did grow out of that did n't you
Arr Hand over your jewels Missy
A river pirate
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
You did n't want to farm
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older
Unfair You are completely unfair
So you 're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger
I was n't the only one risking my neck that day
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole We 're all so proud of you Jesse And not a single farm 's been sold to the railroad since You 're everybody 's hero
What
I should n't tease a hero
What you do to me is unfair The teasing I mean
Teasing you is completely unfair
No I mean of course not No
You 're sick of my company
I 've been on my back two weeks I 'm sick of it
You should n't be up
Nuh-huh
Jesse is that your hand
Mmmm
Jesse are you awake
If there 's anything we can do for you Dr Mimms We want to help
But still died
But you got big
You were little Jesse James when you left
Zerelda Little Zee Mimms
Fair enough
I 'd just as soon kill you Jesse James But chasing you takes up too much of my time
Thanks
The railroad has no business in Tennessee Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee
He 's too important James They 'll set the army on you You and your wife
That was for my Ma Now this is for everybody else
No I 'll hang you But I may miss you just a bit
Ahh you 'll miss me
You cocky little bastard
I 'm not hanged yet
That 's what I would have done
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it
Was it worth it
I figured
Oh That 's nice to know We 're going to hang you you know
No that one was close A couple fellas quit after that one
I went myself to oversee the operation Did n't help much
Almost got me in Billings I saw you there shooting at me
Damn
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town
Yes
You had all those cattle there so I 'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive
Mmm
Last February
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell
Pity
You almost ended my career before it began
Not that day I am guilty of many things but that was Mr Thaddeus Rains and Parker that day
Did you order our houses burned down
That 's the idea
So I 'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains
Oh it 's a similar room But the hotel is in Washington D.C You 're not going to get a fair trial down here in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers
But I like the presidential suite
We 're moving you tomorrow
Communion
Right here in church
Now let 's have a drink
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof
Thank you
Discretion Sir I am a man of the cloth
I could have lied I suppose but I want this marriage to be legal I just want you to know I 'm trying to start a new life here I 'm depending on your
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable Jesse Woodson James Jesse James The Jesse James
You do n't think God 'll mind do you
This is unusual Most of our marriages are members of the congregation
You 're gon na tell her when you 're resting up in bed with her Jimmy
Jesse you explain to Lyla My girl you know from that time
This time we 'll make an exception
too young for whisky
It 's his money He 's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains do n't you Jesse
What about that Rock Island bastard
You do that
Tell you something else I ca n't drink that good neither I 'm going to go outside and throw up
I swear
You and Frank and Cole and even Bob get all these girls because you 're good looking and famous You do n't have to pay They just look at me like I 'm the baby brother Do n't tell anyone okay Jesse
I think so
Hell yeah I been with Uh not exactly It 's just I do n't want to get one of these paid ladies you know
You been with a girl ever
Well not exactly
Tonight Why I 'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm
Jim you been with a girl yet
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole Now it 's my turn
I guess so
Not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
Yeah Hey are you drinking whisky You 're too young to be drinking whisky
You okay Jesse
No
I like that
And the same age Web was No
I 'm the same age you were when you went off to war
And you 're too young
Do n't talk about it much though
Really
Devereux My brother Cole dated a European girl once
That is so gentlemanly of you
Why do n't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
Could we go upstairs and talk It 's so loud down here
Gosh that 's a pretty name Buy you a drink
Lyla Devereux
Thank you Miss
I just though you were awful cute
Not at all
I hope I 'm not being too forward
Really
Yes but just so I could find out who you were
Oh you were talking to Jesse
I hope you do n't mind Jesse James told me your name
Why yeah
Move you fools
There 's only four of them
They donate money to farmers to churches Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school
How can that be
By burning down their homes
They had to be dealt with
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
It 's not my job to relax I 've put men facing out both ways down Main Street so nobody can ride in shooting I 've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case
Relax Alan The Army has this all in hand And Mr Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate
I 'm doing you folks a favor
Well this land is about to be condemned
Not such a menace now is he Pinkerton
How did you know
I remember you
This is him
Oh that I 'll let Jenkins explain
That
What sir
What is that
Sir
Parker
I look forward to seeing it
The final route for the railroad is complete
We should go burn that school to the ground sir
With my money
What is going on here man
Your men knew the risks
We did
THEN WHO DID
To be precise they did n't blow up the tracks
I 'll kill them for blowing up my railway
Thirty-five thousand sir Coins and currency And the delay from the miles of destroyed track
How much did they get from the safe
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards killing several of them Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile
I 'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress
I see I 'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool I see a power void to be filled As we have the most power we may move with impunity
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers
Just perfect
Yes sir
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers
Unfortunately not sir A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable Mr Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident
Good
Two weeks ago we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers
Parker tell me what 's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars not necessarily in that order
I can completely understand your distress sir
NO It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you can not seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen
Really
And it is my pleasure to be here
Mr Thaddeus Rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field
Vengeance
What the hell is that sound
Why their intense hatred of you of course
What is that
No need I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
Can you put men at all four
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
In English Pinkerton
Every three months the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty Missouri They always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends
No
So he 's won
It 's going to be a long spring
Ca n't you tell me anything
No you demand results They are not the same thing And if you want results you will let me do my job as I see fit Unless of course You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it
I demand action
Yes that 's the way to win the locals back to our side
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly as heroes
I ca n't believe this
First of all you shut up Now you 've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover Every time the James Gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area But there 's just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in This gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs
All of the James Gang 's encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this group 's cunning
Pinkerton It 's been eight months I see robberies I see hold ups But I do not see men on the end of nooses
It 's going to be a long winter
So you ca n't tell me anything
Hardly farmers I 've done some checking All these were in the War These men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them They are disciplined well-trained and have a charismatic leader If I were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what I would create
I 'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
It 's early in the game yet Mr Rains Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves feeling out each other 's patterns
Oh that 's the best part
The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land Who wrote this I 'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month
It is a nice piece of writing
A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St Louis Missouri The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West
I 'm afraid our adversaries do n't agree
This is no game
Would a jury around here convict their own I think not We 're beginning an interesting game here Mr Rains
I want them arrested and hanged
Oh no I would have done that But I would have made sure I killed them too
You would n't have done that
Not to mention my men who lost their lives
Look at this Pinkerton They got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least
Nothing
Yes
Patrick
Yes Courtney
Is n't that special Patrick
You look marvelous There 's nothing to say You 're going to marry Luis Next week no Less

Davis I 'm not one to bad-mouth anyone your joke was amusing But come on man you had one fatal flaw Bateman 's such a dork such a boring spineless lightweight that I could n't fully appreciate it I was n't fooled for a second Now if you 'd said Price or McDermott Otherwise it was amusing Now let 's have lunch or dinner or something Hilarious Davis A killer
Carnes Wait
But wait Harold what do you mean
By the way Davis how is Cynthia You 're still seeing her right
The message you left
What exactly do you mean
It was a pretty long message was n't it
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls Oh that s fabulous That 's rich
Yes naturally
Jesus Davis Yes That was hilarious That was you was n't it
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s
Excuse me gentlemen Right back He approaches Carnes cautiously
What CARRUTHERS I 'll call you

Ask me a question
Yes Caron 's right Gorbachev 's not downstairs He 's at Tunnel
Impressive Very nice Let 's see Paul Owen 's card
Raised lettering pale nimbus white
But wait You ai n't seen nothin yet
I ca n't believe that Price prefers McDermott 's card to mine
New card What do you think
What 's that a gram
Well we have to end apartheid for one And slow down the nuclear arms race stop terrorism and world hunger But we ca n't ignore our social needs either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women 's freedom of choice
Like what
Oh come on Price There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about Sure our foreign policy is important but there are more pressing problems at hand
I guess you 're right THAT IS IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT 'S OKAY
Calm down Let 's do it anyway
SHUT UP
I want to get high off this Bateman not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran

What
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram Oh my God
Maybe it 's just the light
Jeez That 's not a helluva lot is it
Oh who knows They do n't know that Prove it
I 'm not sure guy but I do n't think dyslexia is a virus

Is n't it ridiculous Coming all the way up here but you know They really are the best
Well
Hello
Hi Patrick I thought that was you
You actually listen to Whitney Houston You actually have a Whitney Houston CD More than one
Did you know that Whitney Houston 's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it Did you know that Christie Whitney 's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she 's mainly a jazz singer-that it 's hard to take in the album on a first listening
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys Patrick You 're making me feel weird
Well you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing
No I 'm not a lesbian Why do you think I 'd be into that
Are you telling me you 've never gotten it on with a girl
Does he do this all the time
Come on I think it would be a turn-on
Let 's not get lewd I 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation
Come on Do n't you find Christie attractive
Patrick you re a lunatic
Listen I would just like to see the two of you get it on What 's wrong with that It 's totally disease-free
Do you have any coke Or Halcyon I 'd take a Halcyon
No
Did you know that guy who disappeared Did n't he work at Pierce Pierce too Was he a friend of yours
I want the number idiot Anyway I 'm at Paul Norman 's and I 'll try you later and if I do n't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I 'm going to sic my hairdresser on you
Paul Owen
Who
You 're at Paul Owen s
This tastes weird Harley It 's me I need your services Translate that anyway you 'd like I 'm at
Why would I
Do n't tell him you 're here
He 's a goddamn drug dealer These are his peak hours
Elizabeth it 's three in the morning
She 's from France
Uh huh
She 's my cousin
If you had an American Express card she 'd give you a blowjob Listen this girl worked in a tanning salon need I say more What do you do
What do you mean she was a hot number
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso Split town for a while Maybe he did go to London Sightseeing Drinking Whatever Anyway I 'm pretty sure he 'll turn up sooner or later I mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous Is n't that right Patrick
Oh right Of course We had wanted Paul Owen to come But he said he had plans I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott Frederick Dibble Harry Newman George Butner and  you
So who was he with
He was n't with Paul Owen
Where was Marcus
Oh KIMBALL Now where were you
I checked it out It 's clean
He does You 're sure
Yes
Well does Marcus have an alibi
Yes
But Marcus denied it
Yes And he denies it Though at first he could n't be sure
Marcus
I 've questioned him
And
According to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner with Marcus Halberstam
But how Where do you place Paul that night
I think maybe you 've got your dates mixed up
I 'm not really sure I had a shower and some sorbet
So the night he disappeared Any new thoughts on what you did
Suit yourself I guess
Yes of course The hash browns are delicious I 'm just not ordering them
But everyone orders the hash browns here I mean it's-have you been here before
Not in the mood I guess
No hash browns
I 'll be there
Well to each his own So-lunch Thursday I 'll call your secretary about reservations
No I like music Just-they're-Huey 's too black sounding For me
Not a big music fan eh
Never I mean I do n't really like singers
Absolutely I 'm with you on that one
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen 's disappearance it would make my job a lot easier
Great yes I 'd like that
Listen I 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I 've sorted out all this information
Patrick please I hope I 've been informative Long day-a bit scattered
Well thank you Mr Bateman
We had gone to a new musical called Oh Africa Brave Africa It was a laugh riot and that 's about it I think we had dinner at Orso 's No Petaluma No Orso 's The last time I physically saw him was at an automated teller I ca n't remember which just one that was near um Nell 's
Well When was the last time you were with Paul Owen
Well I could he wrong
Let 's see That you were with
Well I Wait What information have you received
That 's not the information I 've received
What
Wait That 's not what I 've got
I had a date with a girl named Veronica
God I guess I was probably returning videotapes
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul 's disappearance Which was on the twentieth of December
Not really
Yeah gone into rehab Shame Is he a suspect
I actually came to see Timothy Price but he 's taken a leave of absence
Dan great to see you again Like I said you need anything at all I 'm your man I do n't envy your job I mean Owen was a complex man
I mean they want to get caught
Too true You know Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they 're in a relaxed setting do n't you think
Yeah No Finlandia as usual Fucking dump
0h no Informal conversations mostly What 's that Stoli
How 's the investigation going Taken anyone in for formal questioning
Uh yes I mean whenever necessary You know
So you hang out here a lot
Don
Detective Kendall uh Campbell KIMBALL Kimball Call me Don
Great and thanks for your uh time Mr Bateman
Absolutely I 'm 100 with you
Listen if anything occurs to you any information at all
Oh really I did n't know that
Uh no There 's one down here
Is n't the Four Seasons a little far uptown I mean are n't you going to be late
You 'll have to excuse me I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes
Eerie Really eerie
The earth just opens up and swallows people
People just disappear
Nothing
It 's just strange One day someone 's walking around going to work alive and then
That 's so typical is n't it
No not yet As I said we 're not sure But basically no one has seen or heard anything
I mean no one 's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right
No it actually had n't Toiletries were missing A suit was gone So was some luggage That 's it
Had his apartment been burglarized
No
Have you consulted a psychic
Yeah I know and was into that whole Yale thing
Yikes No Paul was n't into that He followed a balanced diet and
I know it sounds like a lame question but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question but last month-I do n't know if you 've heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
What
Was he involved at all do you think in occultism or Satan worship
Oh
Well I 've had a hard time getting an actual verification A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but I checked it out and what happened is he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul so
Hmmm
Actually yes
But has anyone seen him in London
His girlfriend does n't think so
Well maybe he did huh
Well there 's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints
So was I
We were both seven in 1969
Anything else you can tell me about Owen
I just wanted to know if you know BATEMAN Before Yale If I remember correctly Saint Paul 's Listen I just I just want to help
Do n't you know this
And where did he go to school
No he just hung out there
He had a yacht
Let me think The Newport Harry 's Fluties Endochine Nell 's Comell Club The New York Yacht Club The regular places
Yeah You know hang out
Hang out
Where did Paul hang out
No Not really
Do you feel that way
I hope I 'm not being cross-examined here
What kind of man was he Besides the information you 've just given
He led what I suppose was an orderly life He ate a balanced diet
So there 's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen
What do you mean Yale thing
Yeah Yale thing
Yale thing
I 'm at a loss He was part of that whole Yale thing you know
How well did you know him
Well
What can you tell me about Paul Owen
No problem
You sure
No I guess it 's okay
Would you rather I not smoke
I know I 'm sorry
Bad habit

PATTEN Some guys are just born cool I guess
I just do n't see how someone anyone can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit How can you be so fucking I do n't know cool about it
I do n't believe it He looks so normal He seems so out of it So undangerous
PATTEN What shit Now where do we have reservations at I mean I 'm not really hungry but I would like to have reservations somewhere
How can he lie like that How can he pull that shit
PATTEN Good point Excuse me gentlemen
You 'll look like you consciously worked for the look
PATTEN You think so
Anything That 's not even credible If he wants to go up there To check it out I think you should encourage him It 's his life But everybody 's treating him like this valuable object You 're hurting your own case
I ca n't help it I feel like they 'd do anything to keep their
I can paint anywhere
You do n't wan na move do you
You know what he 's like He just wants to work on stuff that 's cool
I 'm just screwed
You know what I mean
Make him
Alice You got ta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me
Gon na wait outside
You are a fanatic
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs
Is it over
You 're just afraid to eat it
Right Wait A toast
It 's gon na get cold
wan na savor this
Great
Here we go
Oh right Hold on
Do n't we have any chopsticks
Milo
I know you You 're gon na run back to work right after dinner I want my kiss now
What
Yeah Give me a goodbye kiss
You look beautiful
Look at me I 'm gon na change
Great
Just shut up
No No I sent an E-mail to somebody just now To tell her how I feel about you You know I 'm clueless without you You know I
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary 's office You know Just to hold it again
Are you gon na tell me where you went
Milo you
I know you think I 'm too attached to him but still I am close to Gary And you 're the most meaningful person in my life I 'm going back to the Comix place why should I be killing myself
Milo
It 's for the Museum He knows you 're a painter If anybody should be invited
He has thousands of employees Milo
Why does n't he ask us to his party He 's never even met you
What
Look at this
Okay yeah I did something naughty There 's this amazing Comix store in Seattle To tell you the truth I did it once or twice at Stanford 'Guess I ca n't keep anything from you
Where were you You know you ca n't keep anything from me
Different
That was different
Poor baby You know that 's not true
If I 'd stayed down there maybe this wouldn't 've happened
Guilt
After I broke into 21 which was insane thank God they did n't catch me I just drove around Trying to figure out what possessed me You know what I 've been putting my own guilt on Gary
I remember
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when
Remember Lyle Barton
Why
It 's what they said it is An unfinished broadcast studio You were right I just drove to Seattle and back
Nothing
Nothing
It 's almost nine I 've been so worried What did you see in there
So you believe me
Whaddo I do
I know how to get in there But you 've got ta help me
Is it two Or is it three Have you ever really noticed
They stop the construction work at six or seven The parking lot 's mostly clear by two or three in the morning Even the early Geeks do n't get there before five
You ca n't just walk in either
I ca n't just walk away
Milo you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place How could they hope to hide a surveillance post And how can you get in there anyway With the cameras and the swipe cards
It 's the only one with dishes on the roof The studio 's a front That 's why they keep postponing its opening got ta get in there
Even if all this were true There 're 20 other buildings All of them filled with computers and
How should I know Solving a problem I guess Or needing to control everything I do n't know I 've got ta get in there
Milo Why would he
You think I do n't know that
Like this It 's Gary you 're talking about
Go where You ca n't get away from people like this
You 're scaring me I think we should just go
It is n't a broadcast studio It 's a surveillance post or something That 's why they have the dishes on top
Nobody does work like this on-line It 's in your PC or in a mainframe Self-contained They 'd have to be like watching people Physically Oh Jesus
They hack into people 's programs
I do n't know I just know it was Teddy 's code All these ideas flying in from everywhere You know how he says Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business It 's like they know what every kid 's doing
I ca n't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
I do n't know what I 'm saying Maybe maybe they hired those guys
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death Nelson said it was an airtight case
It was a hate crime
What 're you what
Teddy was killed last night
What
You 're right It 's a working relationship Do n't know what I was expecting
I mean if one little comment from Gary is gon na upset you this much
What 's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach Eat another sesame seed and that 's it
Is n't that extreme
If you ca n't deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
I know I know
He 's your boss He 's not your
That 's what I 'm asking myself Does he have some genius stowed away Why not let him write Skywire 'Not saying it makes sense
What would it mean anyway If he did n't write it
It 's the way he said it Just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie That 's how you knew you were onto something ugly
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning I said Did you really do this just today Cause I was impressed He said What 're you implying
That 's what I need to ask you You know you ca n't keep anything from me
To our new life What 's wrong
Milo What about
You know he 's never been anybody 's counselor before
We 're not gon na let it
That took some fun out of
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call We 'll leave it for him
When 's Brian coming for the TV
You saved my life in alot of ways
Do n't bring that up Like a different girlfriend would'd 've let you die
C'mon I would n't have a destiny without you My destiny would be dying at 20 From eating
No way You have this destiny
I forgot That 's why you have to help me decide
Did n't you visit the campus
But
I think that 's great Milo I do
If my dad 'd leveled with me like that even once The weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary It 's his fantasy too
But he 's not quite the same guy anymore Do n't get your hopes too high
When I was a kid And he was moving us all over the place I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0 I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest
Bully Are we talking about Gary Boyd Or your dad
If he 's really a bully he wo n't cop to it anyway
It 's important
Then you 've got ta ask him about that
A lot of what Larry says is true They just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they
C'mon how often do you talk to somebody who 's been on the cover of Time Three of four times
I think I kind of lost it I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful 'Did n't know I even cared about that stuff
I do n't think he knows how
He was n't acting
He said it made sense that Gary 's code was like Teddy 's that that cliché about great minds was true Said it was all about his own guilt Plus he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while It always passes
Prick
Lisa 's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team We 've got our eyes on her You keep yours on Milo
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl Fire her Or something
That 'll be a test wo n't it
He 'll tell me when he gets home
Not like him is it To do a thing like that without telling you You 're not losing your hold on him are you
No
'Did n't mention he was going to the Justice Department
Yes sir
And Outpost You 're happy there
'Just did n't know who else to talk to
Let me look into it see what 's being done Frankly it 's not my area
I just wan na help bring these guys to justice They 're neo-Nazis
If there 's a Civil Rights violation But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first
It was racially motivated He 's Chinese He was And I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that Do n't they
My goodness
My friend my best friend Teddy was killed in Silicon Valley
Milo
I am I am sir
What seems to be the problem You look a little upset
Have a seat
Yeah Hi Thank you for seeing me
Milo
Give me two seconds with Lacy here Go on in I wo n't be a moment
Yes sir I need to talk to you
It 's Milo is n't it
Mr Barton do you remember me
Like I said shot in the dark
It 's just I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability Create something
Beggar We 're at a disadvantage with Outpost Our experts are n't as smart as theirs Sometimes we ca n't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights I 'm taking a shot in the dark here I can offer you 32,000 a year a Buick I 'm hoping you 've got a feeling it 's the right thing to do
Right What 's that mean again
Do n't worry Milo I 'm here as a friend Or maybe a supplicant
You should 've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
When did you know
He 's working backwards too Let 's do number five
What
Is it your dish
Is it your software
Gim me the coordinates
You 're interfaced with our dish
Wan na be a part of history
What
Great Great We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door
Okay
What 'd they ever do for you
What
No But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this We 're gon na bring down Outpost
Will I get to work for Outpost
Brian You wan na be a big deal do n't you That 's your dream in life
You ca n't pre-empt Yoga that 's our biggest show
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software You 'd be my partner
'Forgot to introduce you I have a girlfriend
Well I parked illegally See y'later
Sure I 'll see what I can do
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case I 'm writing programs for the local public access station Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show God does it suck Can you help me
You 're living here
PUNDIT You better believe everybody 's trying to sign him up
KING We tried
PUNDIT Milo Surprised he 's not your guest
KING And the kid who wrote Skywire then gave it away They 're calling him the digital Robin Hood
PUNDIT Stigma Larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
KING Is n't there a stigma Bankrolling this guy
PUNDIT There 's no hard evidence he knew about this Anybody who could implicate him seems to 've vanished
KING That 'd change with a criminal indictment
PUNDIT Conglomerates 're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites They 'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line
KING Outpost does n't own em
PUNDIT Outpost was his baby sure On the other hand we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites Personally
KING That 's got ta kill him right
I think they call him the Houseman 'Cause guard sounds too weird
Who 's that
He just likes to write code He 's bummed there 's so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
We could move 'em up here
He 's pretty tight with his family
'Could n't convince Teddy to come
Oh hi
Milo I 'm Danny
I do know You focus on the big problem But somewhere down the chain something breaks down Something gets destroyed At first it 's upsetting You feel you 've lost control
I 'm pretty close But when I wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer You know what it 's like writing software
I do know Gary I feel the same way I thought I was coming here for a job But it 's meant a lot more
I hope you know what you mean to me Not just because of what you 're doing Because of who you are
You see what 's hanging on the wall
Gary I
Oh that 's right You 're clueless
I 'm not much good at handwriting Or parties
You could 've handwritten it
I could n't do it at work cause of security or at home for obvious reasons
Dear Lisa I 've enjoyed working with you I 'd be lying if I did n't say I find you attractive But in my heart I know that Alice You left my party to send E-mail
'Sorry about the late notice
That 's great Thanks
Do n't be so hard on yourself With a brain like yours you could connive with the best of 'em I bet
Cause he was a liar And I hated him Get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world The more he mocked me the deeper I went Cause if being savvy meant being like him Guess that 's why I 'm kind of clueless even now Did n't cultivate my conniving side 'Not sure I even have one
Worse
No I just went deeper into the machine Preferred being the geek to having to explain Lying would 've been worse
What would you tell the kids At your new school You had to come up with a good story right
My dad was a compulsive gambler Only he did n't think he was That applied to guys who did n't have a system Losers who played games of chance He could read people so chance had nothing to do with it No matter how deep a hole he dug himself he 'd give you the whole speech And you 'd better not point out the obvious His creditors would catch up to him Loan sharks or whatever He 'd wake us in the middle of the night Off we 'd go again
Why did you move around so much When you were a kid
Sure
'Have a look
I 'm okay It 's going well
You look a little tired
Gary hi
The answer 's not in the box It 's in the band
The wrong place
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler And it came over me it 's in the wrong place
34,000 But they 're real short lines 'Just came out that way
Wow You must have 20,000 lines of code there
It helps Alice said it would help To focus on something 'Do n't know what I 'd do without her
You 've been coming in early
Oh Yeah
I meant did you find other stuff to
Talk about work Never
Did you
Just once 'Guess I was worried we did n't have anything to talk about since work was off-limits Non disclosure
Had you talked to him much lately
Were the flags for Teddy
I heard what happened
Definitely
It scales do n't you think
The purpose of this company is n't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath But the software business is binary you 're a zero or a one Being obsessive is n't a crime It 's a character trait
I 'm sure
Everything I do is under scrutiny The questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid I 'm confused Does n't everybody in business try to get ahead
Nothing
What 're you implying
You really wrote this just today
Right Right
Well you sent for me
Milo What 's up
You 're making me young again
You did this overnight
Take a look at this Slightly different approach
It 's okay Really
Too fast At least four companies 're on the verge of workable convergence systems Milo they
Maybe I 'm going too fast
How 's it going
Do n't spend too much time searching You ever vetted somebody 's old code before It 's a different skill Stay close to the surface The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight You know the best place to hide a leaf right In a tree
Could work with a new switch There may be a few more things hidden
That 's what I told her My wife
That 's insane You 're ahead of your time
Somebody said I 'm just another Philistine With reproductions
Do I
'Think I should buy some originals
Okay I 'm Gary
No Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
Yeah I wan na feel like I did when I wrote that But I 'm 42 that 's 100 in cyber-years I look at you and see the things that got me here But somehow got away
I do
When you get to a certain age you start wondering About your legacy I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0
You 'd have to start practically from scratch But this is all you 'd be working on No marketing meetings no product seminars We ca n't waste the time Half the Valley 's working on convergence So 're media conglomerates cable companies phone companies 'Ca n't finish second Milo There is no second Now what would you like to ask me
It needs a more object-oriented language This does n't scale does it
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms Really omniplatforms Including whatever new hardware emerges
Skywire
Among other things We know convergence is the real super-highway all the PC 's TV 's phones etc linked together Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky
Low enough to relay internet traffic
I 've only shown this to three other people I bought 200 we 've launched 12 so far I keep the coordinates in this room It 's left over from SDI Reagan 's Star Wars technology They orbit 426 miles up
There 's a rumor going around maybe you 've heard it
You know a lot about art I guess
Oh No thanks
Would you like a Coke or something
Cool
You would Wow When would we come 'Think he hung up
Milo Gary Boyd I 'm hoping you and your friend can come up here We 've made some amazing strides in digital convergence I 'd love to show them to you
Hello
Just do it
Gary
'Knows I 'm altering the coordinates Let 's jump to 12
What
Wait He knows
Longitude 109
Let 's go
Ready for number three
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes
Okay 2
Just do what I 'm asking
Gary do n't worry we
Help me change the Skywire settings Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
Nothing does Still I want him to like me
Has n't affected his work though
There may be a little less trust after your outburst
What 'd the girl say
Maybe we should all get on it
'Start-up not 50 miles from here Kid 's on Prozac
This is good Who did it
Cool
You guys 'll be using Teddy 's old space is that okay
Got out of my other commitment
You wan na work here
We 'll come up with the next big thing
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water
Those really weird short lines
Man could he write code Totally elegant He had his own style
It 's only meaningful when you 've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up
He was on the verge of something too He was gon na show us the next day He said The answer 's not in the box it 's in the band Know what it means
Just thought his work should go on
You are naive Look at your employment contract you ca n't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years Not that I do n't miss you
I know you lost all his work Maybe I could come down here and
I mean it 's your life
You do
I think you should go
In exchange for endowments They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em
All the companies know The faculties tell 'em At the target schools
I launched Skywire Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary 's satellite
Now what are we doing I do n't get any of this shit
Where we going
Come with me
I 'm calling Gary
You calling Phil and Randy
They know 'Just they do n't trust me with it So we 'll get the evidence first ask questions later
Get the backslash the colon keys kids do n't use but geeks do What would Milo want in here anyway
Let 's get him in here
Delbert seems to enter 21 twice Without leaving the first time
Any irregularity in the pattern
What 're we looking for
Keep looking
Every entry was authorized
Not yet 'Love to bust my ass cause I 'm not in frigging Mensa I swear to God it 's that kid Milo I told 'em so in the first place but they did n't even wan na hear about it Let 's run a printout on card entries
Unlikely All 14 cameras are frozen Do we call Randy and Phil Tell 'em there may have been a break-in
Could it be a glitch Something the construction workers caused
Wait a second He knows I know
Latitude 47 degrees
He 's been altering the coordinates since we logged on He 's a step ahead Let 's jump to 12
What
He knows
Let 's try 2
Maybe it 's the satellite
But you said the other
Bring it to the other location
It 's three years old it
They know I had no choice Get out of the house now Do you have a laptop
Tell me you 're not calling on your car phone
Meet me at the other location
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary
Please do n't go
She called to apologize I said I was pulling an all-nighter She said then come home just to say Hi Which I always do when we fight it 's suspicious if I do n't
Why
He suspects I know something I think he was sort of explaining himself to me in case I do We have to go in tonight I 'm two hours from a Beta version But I 've got ta go home for an hour
Does he know you know
You 'll come up with something
That 's lame is n't it
You could always say you have to go the bathroom
Perfect How am I gon na get away from the party long enough to
Same with the excerpts I 'm choosing they 'll play against any of the images you described
Milo What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M And tells them about it
Oh
Yeah that 's old in a tree
Hardly anybody does that 's the beauty part No cameras the DOJ does n't bother with it it 's accessed by a tunnel they boast about You know the best place to hide a leaf
He does n't know about the Day Care
They know I broke in Alice helped me Shrot 's not one of them He 's blundering into this on his own
Milo Shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
Thank God
The dishes are juiced up too
Great I knocked off the aglet as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we 're there
Gary
I felt guilty 'Cause I owed so much to Alice But even then I was starting to wonder Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you If you have a lucrative skill it 's all anybody wants from you You grow older but you do n't grow up You turn into into
A beautiful geek What 're the chances
What 'd he say
I told Teddy about you
'Cause their apartments might be bugged
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
Oh I liked you I was checking you out
Why were you snooping in my office
I thought the worst they would do is fire me Who knew they took termination so literally
Why were you so careless
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 are n't hot yet You said the place is n't finished
I do n't know
You mean break in
Oh man I 'd have to get into Gary 's house To get the satellite positions
Before they kill somebody else too
Gary knows I 'm close on Skywire We have to do this fast
It 's a standard GUI Once I 've got a concept it 's maybe three day 's work
You 'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop Maybe some audio too To tie it all in to Gary How long would that take you
But they 'd still get the idea right
It 's how on-line services push logos they wan na sell you You do n't ask for 'em they just appear 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house And then the quality of the broadcast would n't exactly be digital that 's 12 months away
A what
We ca n't just assume they 're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch I 'd have to write in an aglet
He 's got 12 satellites up He 's got dishes on top of 21 He 's building this mega-network for Skywire Let 's use it
What
How close are you
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary 's set-top device That also takes out CNN GE joins Outpost in new venture which means NBC is out Disney joins Outpost ABC is out Outpost and Newscorp in new deal Fox is out Any of these places could have a mole Or all of 'em It 's like a a continuous loop We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read get them and us killed But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary 's got a finger in
Time
Say there 's just one mole working there like Barton at the DOJ How do we know he 's not the guy we 've contacted Or she Or the guy she works for
But still you ca n't say CBS would n't love to break something like
Yeah they dig stuff like this CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001
What about 60 Minutes
He 's buying up pretty much everything cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives Getting ready for Skywire
Certainly not at my happy home
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership But not on our own computers Not even at home
Right But Gary 's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates Have to be careful who we pick
The mainstream media TV or a newsmagazine
There 're so many disinformation sites about Gary already Where he has devil 's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein
Do we post it on the Net
There 's always a logical answer you just have to define the question
Who can we trust
They 've got this guy in the DOJ maybe others We tell the wrong person it 's over
What about the FBI
No no Never
I always felt if a boy I liked ever found out he 'd run He 'd think I was unclean
Hmm
Milo
They 're already watching you If they had to they 'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout He 'd wake up not even remembering his act of revenge
He 's out of prison
They 'd frame him
Is that my scenario Tell me
Oh yeah
I know why you 're so secretive Why you wo n't let anybody near you I know what he did to you
You know There is no second place And what 's the risk The killings 're undetectable they 're hand-tailored they make sense I mean they 're in the information business They have scenarios for all of us too In case we find out too much
But why would they
It 's easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell 'em They upload medical files school records pharmacy files They 'd be happy just to steal code forever But when a program gets close to fruition Like Teddy He was almost there
The Day Care
You thought about it too You 've been suspicious for a while But it 's not happening in there It 's happening in the Day Care
Why would you do a thing like
I snuck into 21
She saved my life
That 's great I did n't know
Then and now But not right now
So when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers Was that then Or now
Long story Not that interesting
Why 's that
Mmm-more like I have a little trouble Trusting people
You 're compulsive
Maybe once I re-wrote it anyway
Right right But does he ever just like hand you code
Mine 's not the CEO He barely remembers to take a shower
There is no second place Plus every time I get jammed-up Gary has an inspiration Is it like that with your counselor
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps How fast are you going
No Please
Did you wan na be alone
Yeah I ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to
Cool
Show me
Graphical interfaces For Skywire I 'm s'posed to coordinate with you
What 've you got there
No I know what you mean I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers Least they make sense Sometimes you think they 've betrayed you Like a person would But then you see no you just missed a step You can go back and make it all work
Did I say something
Did n't mean to pry I just have this theory Some of us who got to good at this We were escaping something
Something like that Yeah
Me too Were you an Army brat or something
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers
Were you
I would n't worry about it You 've got ta figure most people around here were their teachers pets
I 'm getting a teacher 's pet rep
You 're famous around here
You know mine
You know my name
Lisa
I did n't plan this
Milo geeks do n't have two girlfriends Most do n't have one
What does that mean
I dunno I guess Larry 's got me totally suspicious of that place
What d'you mean
A beautiful geek I do n't wan na sound paranoid or like a pig but what 're the chances
No I keep thinking it 'll go away But there 's this connection She 's been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot Plus I see her every day we 're working on the same program She 's beautiful
Did you tell Alice
I do n't know
What Come on Is it serious
I met this girl
I 'm cool They did n't touch the machine Or my disks Probably did n't know what they were So you a Moonie yet Milo
Jesus Teddy
They 're in the neighborhood They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers
What
But these like White Supremacists trashed my office last week
Outpost made me sign 1,000 'Guess we 'll find out what else we have to talk about Life stuff
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale You know what 's the bad part We ca n't talk about work anymore We 're competitors The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms
Hey we got seed money for the startup A million-five
Wanted to say goodbye to him
Uh Not exactly
Is that how Larry feels
And your phone messages You wan na do what you do it 's not a crime
You got my E-mail
You wan na survive in the software business you cover your bets I got ta say this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
Gary 's not into fiber optics He 's betting everything on the satellites
21 Way behind schedule It 's top secret but everybody knows it 's a digital broadcast space They see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
What 're they building
Right That 's rare around here You know how nuns re-married to Jesus 'Posties are married to Outpost
I 've got a girlfriend remember
Heavy graphical background doing design-interface for Skywire apps You 'll be working with her
She 's a programmer
Every geek here 's got a thing for Lisa But that 's about the biggest reaction she 's had to anybody
Well he micro-managed the company till it got too big 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something
His Snapples were in alphabetical order
So how 'd you like the house
Oh we 're not going to the campus
So how far are we from the campus
You do n't look anything like a three year-old
Damn 'Have to go back over there Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
Did you download Corey In San Jose
Yeah yeah
Speaking of which
Maybe he 'll get back to work
There is no public offering The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo 'Wrote this just to run their web site
Can we buy into their IPO Or is that a Justice Dept problem
We tried the big vaporware number Gary it 's no-sale
We 're all grateful for that Really Go out the way you came in
Wait a second I 'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
Fellas I 'm gon na have to ask you to leave here now
We 're too late Take a look
Where is he
Who 're these guys
You 're not listening
I could get it out of him
That kid 's the great white hope
Unless it 's a diversion Milo 's in my office He was tailgating so I
There 's nothing in this hall Someone 's pulling your chain as usual
Not much Glorified cherry bomb Right by the civil defense sign Some geek 's idea of irony I been saying we need a camera in this hall
What is it
Oh you 're very clever Let 's make love you silly hairy little man
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem 'Press the button pull the chain out comes a chocolate choo-choo train
I 'll tell you all in due time after we make love But first tell me another poem
Damn What exactly do you do at Virtucon
Yes
Is it about my teeth
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question
Kiss me
To my health
Thank you that 's beautiful To your health
'Milk milk lemonade Round the corner fudge is made Stick your finger in the hole And out comes a tootsie roll
That 's very clever Do you know any other poems
'Pardon me for being rude It was not me it was my food It just popped up to say hello and now it 's gone back down below
Mmmm I feel extreme relaxation
How do you feel Mr Cunningham
Sak-i it to me
Care for some saki
Or sometimes not at all
In Japan men come first and women come second
Groovy
May I wash you
Do n't you like girls Mr Cunningham Come in and I 'll show you everything you need to know
I 'd rather talk about Number Two
Come in
Behave
It 's for the mining industry Mr Cunningham We can talk about business later But first let me slip into something more comfortable
I did n't baby you just told me
Virtucon 's main interest is in cable television but they do have a subterranean construction division yes How did you know
Your boss Number Two I understand that cat 's involved in big underground drills
You may
Call me Ritchie Miss Fagina May I call you Alotta Please
What do you want Mr Cunningham was it
What and watch all my earnings go Down the toilet
I thought you 'd quit while you were ahead
You seem surprised to see me
Smashing
WARHOL Fifteen minutes of fame I 'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that either
If you can become famous everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame man

Thanks Basil Maybe the Nineties are n't so bad after all
EXPOSITION Here 's the number of my dentist he 's first rate Ring him up he 'll look after you
EXPOSITION Austin I have something for you as well
Congratulations Field Agent Kensington
EXPOSITION Not quite actually Vanessa I have something for you
I 'd say that about sums it up Exposition
EXPOSITION Well Austin you 've stopped Dr Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair
Thanks
EXPOSITION Be careful
Yes Basil
EXPOSITION I 'm leaving Oh and Austin
I think if everyone were honest they 'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag
EXPOSITION All right Austin I think you should go
You must admit she is rather mannish No offense but if that 's a woman it looks like she 's been beaten with an ugly stick
EXPOSITION Damn it man You 're talking about my mother
I 'm sorry Basil I thought she was a man
That 's not your mother that 's a man
EXPOSITION My God Austin what have you done
EXPOSITION Good God and underground missile We 've long feared such a development
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle I 've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan It 's a new subterranean warhead delivery system
EXPOSITION Indeed If we could get back to the business at hand It 's one thing to have a warhead it 's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
Circus folk Nomads you know They smell like cabbage
EXPOSITION What
Carnies
EXPOSITION What 's the other thing you 're scared of
Excuse me
EXPOSITION What 's the other
Thank you Exposition Only two things scare me and one is nuclear war
EXPOSITION Austin Vanessa let me bring you up to speed Dr Evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars If the world does n't pay up in four days he 's threatening to destroy the world
Hello Exposition
Thank you
EXPOSITION Be careful
Yes
EXPOSITION There 's one more thing Austin
Oh yes Thank you
EXPOSITION Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation
Yes
EXPOSITION Oh and Austin
Thank you Basil
EXPOSITION Then you 'll have to go it alone Good luck
She 's working on another lead right now
EXPOSITION Where is Vanessa by the way
Right away Exposition
EXPOSITION Hello Austin this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence Thank you for confirming the link between Dr Evil and Virtucon Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan I 'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately
EXPOSITION Be careful
Yes
EXPOSITION Oh and Austin
Thank you Exposition
EXPOSITION Hello Austin Hello Vanessa This is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence There 's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr Evil Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you 'll be staying That 's the first place you should look Well I 'm off to the chat rooms
Thanks
EXPOSITION Be careful
Yes
EXPOSITION Oh and Austin
Thank you Exposition
EXPOSITION Yes well Agent Kensington will get you set up She 's very dedicated Perhaps a little too dedicated She 's got a bit of a bug up her ass Good luck Austin the world 's depending on you
My God Vanessa 's got a smashing body I bet she shags like a minx How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process I have no inner monologue I hope I did n't say that out loud just now
EXPOSITION Vanessa 's one of our top agents
EXPOSITION No Austin Mrs Kensington has long since retired Ms Kensington is her daughter
You mean Mrs Kensington
EXPOSITION Immediately You 'll be working with Ms Kensington
When do I begin
Groovy Smashing Good on ya Nice tie Yea capitalism
EXPOSITION We won Austin
Thank God Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people hey Comrades
EXPOSITION A lot 's happened since you were frozen Austin The cold war 's over
Russian Intelligence Are you mad
EXPOSITION You might also experience a slight fever dry mouth and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation Austin this is Commander Gilmour Strategic Command and General Borschevsky Russian Intelligence
Yes I 'm having trouble controlling THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE
EXPOSITION The shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
EXPOSITION You 're in the Ministry of Defense It 's 1997 You 've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years
Where am I
Thank you Let 's go baby
EXPOSITION Be careful
Yes
EXPOSITION Oh and Austin
Thank you
EXPOSITION Good luck Austin
Just where you 'd never think to look for him We 'll be there
EXPOSITION I 'm afraid not Earlier this week Dr Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he 's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger 's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London
Dr Evil I thought I put him in jail for good
EXPOSITION I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what 's going on at any given time We 've just received word that Dr Evil the ultimate square is planning to take over the world
We know all that Exposition
EXPOSITION Hello Austin This is Basil Exposition Chief of British Intelligence You 're Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and you 're with Agent Mrs Kensington The year is 1967 and you 're talking on a picture phone
JAGGER Groovy
Good on ya man
JAGGER You ca n't always get what you want That 's a great title for a song I 'm gon na write that and it 'll be a big hit
Well you ca n't always get what you want
JAGGER Are you more satisfied now sexually Austin
Hey Mick
JAGGER Hey Austin Powers it 's me Mick Jagger
Love is love is love is
Why not It 's a question
That does not compute
Really Let me ask you this What is love
Yes I am programmed to answer any question
Well Destructacon 5000 you have quite a head on your shoulders I dare to coin
Good afternoon Mr Powers I 'm the Destructacon 5000 I 'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point You might as well surrender Resistance is futile Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to
Man you are one chilly square
EVIL Not really Kill the little bastard See what I care
It seems the tables have turned again Dr Evil
EVIL Really there 's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster
That 's why right now is a very groovy time man We still have freedom but we also have responsibility
EVIL Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of Face it freedom failed
No man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination We were innocent man If we 'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same It 's freedom man
EVIL Well done Mr Powers We 're not so different you and I It 's true you 're British and I 'm Belgian You have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding You 're thin I 'm about forty pounds overweight OK we are different I 'm not making a very good point However is n't it ironic Mr Powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the Nineties considered to be evil Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
I 've got you Dr Evil
EVIL No Mr Powers I expect them to die Even after they pay me the money I 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma All right guard begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism
Dr Evil do you really expect them to pay
EVIL Oh forget it As a fellow player on the international stage Mr Powers I 'm sure you 'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act
I 'm sorry baby I 'm just not grocking your head space
EVIL Do n't try to suck up to me It 's a little late for that I 'm a freak Look at it it 's been rendered useless
What 's wrong with your hand
Behave
Kiss me
That 's fab because I love you too Vanessa
I love you Austin
Lay it on me
I have something to tell you
I 'll secure the perimeter
I 'm going it alone this time Vanessa I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor
Austin I 'm coming with you
Do n't worry
Are you crazy
Follow me We 're going to have to jump over the rail
Hold on a tick let me put on my togs
I believe you Austin Let 's go
I can explain They attacked me Gas came out of her well and then they and I
Likewise
It 's not what it looks like Vanessa At ease boys
Oh behave
Anyways what I 'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man well that 's just groovy because I love you
Austin what 's your point
Listen Vanessa whatever happens I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden I do n't know what happened The whole time I was shagging her I mean really shagging her I mean it was crazy I was like a huge mechanical piston in and out IN and OUT
I 'll hurry back
Too right youth That 's why I need you to lead the troops
I 'm not going anywhere We 're a team
We 've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag You go get help I 'm gon na stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor
What do we do now
Fair enough
Shut up
It 's a shame he was n't more headstrong
Yes
That 's not the way to get ahead in life
Indeed
Not a good time to lose one 's head
Smashing idea Give it to me
No no no We 'll use the floss to get to the ledge
All right I get it I have bad teeth You have to understand in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth It did n't matter
Sadly no Hold on I always keep this on me just in case
First I plan to soil myself Then I plan to regroup and think about the next move Any thoughts
Not now Austin
Does that make you horny
Yes act naturally and we 'll split this scene the way we came in Vanessa
Thank God Austin we made it
Do n't worry baby I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India I learned it from my guru the late Guru Shastri a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis Just watch me Watch me now
Austin we do n't look anything like our photo badges
I 'm looking at you and the whole time I ca n't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch
No Do n't lay your hang-ups on me Vanessa You 're being very trippy
You know who
Who
Do you think she 's prettier than I
Since I 've been unfrozen I 've had a rancid taste in my mouth Do you have a piece of gum
I 'll tell him By the way I 've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional
Out and about doing odds and sods
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night
Yeah I ca n't believe Liberace was gay Women loved him man I did n't see that one coming
Thirty years of political and social upheaval The fall of the Berlin wall a female Prime Minister of England the abolishment of Apartheid a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang
Hello luv
You just do n't get it do you Austin Good night Welcome to the Nineties you 're going to be very lonely
It was just a shag Vanessa You 're everything to me
Well it means something to me If you want us to have a relationship you 've got to be a one-woman man
Well they should filthy beggars they go from port to port Alotta meant nothing to me
Not in the Nineties
Only sailors use condoms man
No did you use a condom
Of course I had my nine-millimeter automatic
I ca n't believe you made love to her just like that Did you use protection
Do n't be sorry You 're right to be suspicious I shagged her I shagged her rotten
Listen I know I 'm just being neurotic but I ca n't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary Ms Fagina I mean I do n't want to sound paranoid but I 've had some bad relationships in the past and I have some jealousy issues You went to her penthouse It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities but I ca n't help but feel this weird irrational unfocused well jealousy I 'm sorry
Of course luv
Austin may I have a word with you
Look at her hands baby Those are carpenter 's hands
Really Austin
She was very groovy She was so in love with your Dad If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did it was me But unfortunately for yours truly that train has sailed
It 's not that I 'm drunk I 'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about What was my mother like back in the Sixties I 'm dying to know
I ca n't You 're drunk
I 'm not I 'm the sensible one I 'm always the designated driver
Oh yes you are
I am not
You 're smashed Vanessa
No this is me in a nutshell
Always wanting to have fun that 's you in a nutshell
I 'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die
Why
I 'm sorry
I have n't had fun like that since college
Go Just go
Sorry Move your hand to the left There you go Gorgeous
Watch out you 're on my hair
I could n't have another bite
Fancy a nibble
You 're crazy The camera loves you Vanessa
I hate having my picture taken
No worries luv We 'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone
Unfortunately while you told that stupid story Dr Evil has escaped
Well you know cows and shagging
I do n't get it
Let me tell you a story There 's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below The young bull says 'hey why do n't we run down the hill and shag us a cow and the wise old bull replies 'no why do n't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows
We ca n't just sit here Austin
He 's too well-protected right now
Let 's go get him
I never forget a pussy cat
How do you know
Hello hello That 's Dr Evil 's cat
Let me see
A limousine has just pulled up
We 've got a doctor 's appointment an evil doctor 's appointment
Why
Good morning Vanessa I hope you have on clean underwear
Do you want to talk to him
Good morning luv who are you on the phone with
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch I get bad vibes from him man Listen we should go back to the room but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog
Why did you leave so soon
Oh I forgot to tell you they 're prescription X-ray glasses I have very bad astigmatism
I ca n't see a bloody thing
I 'm going to use a cover name It 's important that it be a generic name so that we do n't draw attention to ourselves
Here use mine
I love Las Vegas man Oh I forgot my x-ray glasses
I think I 'll give that stew a ding-a ling
I 'm sure
Hey who put this in here Someone 's playing a prank on me Honestly this is n't mine
Why What 's wrong with my teeth
No actually I do n't know how to put this really Well there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry
Let me guess The floss is garotte wire the toothpaste contains plastic explosives and the toothbrush is the detonation device
Yes we 've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone an on-board computer and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device Oh and finally this
You 've preserved my Jag Smashing
I understand that Mr Powers but let me be perfectly clear with you perhaps to the point of being insulting I will never have sex with you ever If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation I still would not have sex with you
Listen Vanessa I 'm a swinger That 's what I do I swing
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process
Do I make you horny Randy you know To you am I eros manifest
What
Do I make you horny
Sure
Brrrr She must be frigid There 's two things I know about life one Americans will never take to soccer Two Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag They 're shag-mad man Let me ask you a question Vanessa and be honest
That 's right You 're supposed to say 'colored now right Here 's the stewardesses Bring on the sexy stews
We do n't use the term 'Negro anymore It 's considered offensive
You know a Chigro part Chinese part Negro Chigro
A Chigro
Have you ever made love to a Chigro
Mr Powers please I know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand I would appreciate it if you 'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest
My meat and two veg
I 'm sorry
My wedding tackle
Excuse me
I 've been frozen for thirty years man I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working
I beg your pardon
That 's fascinating Vanessa Listen why do n't we go into the back and shag
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects but I ended up specializing in foreign languages I wanted to travel see the world In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D in the Cultural Studies sector I thought I was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country It 's very boring My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi If I do well with this case I finally get promoted to field operative
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet eh How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense
My jumbo jet Smashing baby
Listen Mr Powers I look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby You can address me as Agent Kensington We have to leave immediately We 've preserved your private jet just as you left it It 's waiting at Heathrow Airport
OK OK man do n't get heavy I 'll sign Just to get things moving baby
My mother 's doing quite well thank you very much
If it 's a lie goddamn her It it 's the truth goddamn me God I hope that 's witty How 's your mum
My mother 's told me all about you
Well as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment I 'll be sound as a pound
Mr Powers my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties You know a lot 's changed since 1967

You shot me right in the arm Why did
EVIL Right Okay Moving on
Ow You shot me
EVIL You 've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet Excuse me
Hello up there Anyone Can someone call an ambulance I 'm in quite a lot of pain
EVIL Some of you I know some of you I 'm meeting for the first time
Someone help me I 'm still alive only I 'm very badly burned
EVIL We 've got a lot of work to do
EVIL Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure
Ahhhhhhhhh
EVIL Silence
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process emdash
EVIL And look what you 've done to Mr Bigglesworth
But Dr Evil all you need to do is work with this tennis ball Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day A few months of that and it 'll be just as strong as the other arm
EVIL Ca n't you see I 'm only half a man Look at me I 'm a freak
But my design was perfect Your autonomic functions were shut down and even though your arm was n't frozen the aging was retarded therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left
FARBISSINA Please allow me to demonstrate
EVIL Really Are they ill-tempered
FARBISSINA They 're mutated sea bass
EVIL Right
FARBISSINA Sea bass
EVIL I have one simple request sharks with friggin laser beams attached to their heads and it ca n't be done Remind me again why I pay you people What do we have
FARBISSINA Well we experimented with lasers but you would be surprised at how heavy they are They actually outweighed the piranha themselves and the fish well they sank to the bottom and died
EVIL What is it now
EVIL Right Mr Powers we 're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads
FARBISSINA It 's about the sharks Since you were frozen they 've been placed on the Endangered Species List We tried to get some but it will take months to clear up the red tape
EVIL Yes what is it You 're interrupting my moment of triumph
FARBISSINA Dr Evil
EVIL Release the sharks All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads I figure every creature deserves a warm meal
EVIL I like to see girls of that caliber By caliber I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character Forget it
FARBISSINA Thank you Herr Doctor
EVIL Quite impressive
FARBISSINA These are the latest word in android replicant technology Lethal efficient brutal And no man can resist their charms Send in the soldiers
EVIL Breathtaking Frau These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers
FARBISSINA Ya wohl I mean yes wohl Herr Doctor I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers Bring on the Fembots
EVIL Austin Powers is getting too close He must be neutralized Any suggestions
FARBISSINA Yes Scott
EVIL My son
FARBISSINA Well after a few years we got sort of impatient Dr Evil I want you to meet your son
EVIL Yes
FARBISSINA Remember when we froze your semen you said that if it looked like you were n't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever
That 's not true Doctor Please tell us about your childhood
EVIL The details of my life are quite inconsequential
We 've heard from Scott now let 's hear from you
EVIL Actually the boy 's quite astute I am trying to kill him My Evil Associates have cautioned against it so here he is unfortunately alive
Do n't be so hard on yourself You 're here that 's what 's important A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
EVIL No the boy 's right I really am evil
EVIL Evil actually Doctor Evil
That was great Mr Keon Dave Thank you OK group we have two new member Say hello to Scott and his father Mr Ehville
EVIL Scott do n't say that
EVIL I hate you I hate you I wish I was never artificially created in a lab
EVIL I had the group liquidated you little shit They were insolent
EVIL Dad we just made a breakthrough in group
EVIL Show me
EVIL What did you say
EVIL Blow me
EVIL Do n't you want to see what Daddy does for a living
EVIL I do n't want to
EVIL Come everyone let us repair to the main chamber Project Vulcan is about to begin Scott are you coming
EVIL No Scott You just do n't get it do you
EVIL I have a gun in my room Give me five seconds I 'll come back and blow their brains out
EVIL No we 'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and we 'll just assume it all went to plan
EVIL Are n't you going to watch them They 'll get away
EVIL Fine Whatever Mutated ill-tempered sea bass it is Come let 's return to dinner Close the tank
EVIL One more peep out of you and you 're grounded Let 's begin
EVIL Why do n't you just shoot him now Here I 'll get a gun We 'll just shoot him Bang Dead Done
EVIL I have a better idea I 'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death
EVIL But what if he escapes Why do n't you just shoot him What are you waiting for
EVIL In due time
EVIL Why are you feeding him Why do n't you just kill him
EVIL Scott I want you to meet Daddy 's nemesis Austin Powers
EVIL Yeah What
EVIL And that 's how you want to live your life is it
EVIL Thought I 'd stay in There 's a good tittie movie on Skinemax
EVIL Fascinating What are your plans for this evening
EVIL Well me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and like they do n't speak English right and so my buddy gets into a fight and he goes 'hey quit hassling me cause I do n't speak French or whatever and the other guy goes something in Paris talk and I go 'um just back off and he goes 'get out and I go 'make me
EVIL Scott my boy come here How was your day
EVIL You always do that Anyways this is really hard because you know my Dad is really evil
EVIL An evil petting zoo
EVIL No Maybe like work in a petting zoo or something
EVIL An evil vet
EVIL Not me
EVIL But Scott who 's going to take over the world when I die
EVIL I have n't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship I hate you
EVIL Hello Scott I 'm your father Dr Evil I have a son I have a son Everyone I have a son Someday Scott this will all be yours
EVIL Hi
EVIL Oh really One-hundred billion dollars OK make it happen Anything else
TWO Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year
EVIL All right then FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
TWO Do n't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars A million dollars is n't that much money these days
EVIL Right Oh hell let 's just do what we always do Let 's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage Gentlemen it 's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days Here 's the plan We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS
TWO Umm that also has already happened
EVIL People have to tell me these things I 've been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here OK no problem Here 's my second plan Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser Using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth which we scientists call the Ozone Layer Slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer That is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
TWO Um Dr Evil Prince Charles did have an affair He admitted it and they are now divorced actually
EVIL Gentlemen I have a plan It 's called blackmail The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
TWO We also own the Franklin mint which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors Some plates like the Gone With The Wind series have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved
KENSINGTON I love you Vanessa
I 'm on with a friend Look I 'd better go I love you
KENSINGTON No it 's been too long Best to leave things alone
KENSINGTON I know Let me just say this Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had
You did n't answer my question Mum
KENSINGTON Austin is very charming very debonair He 's handsome witty has a knowledge of fine wines sophisticated a world-renowned photographer Women want him men want to be him He 's a lover of love every bit an International Man of Mystery
Did you ever want to
KENSINGTON Of course not I was married to your father
Did you ever
KENSINGTON Just wait Once Austin gets you in his charms it 's impossible to get out
I just do n't see it
KENSINGTON You have to understand in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth It did n't matter
What about his teeth
KENSINGTON You ca n't judge him by modern standards He 's very much a product of his times In my day he could have any woman he wanted
Well God knows he tried but I 've been rather firm with him Mummy You did n't tell me he was so obsessed with sex It 's bizarre
KENSINGTON Because you managed to resist Austin Power 's charms
Why
KENSINGTON I 'm proud of you
Oh God no I made him sleep on the couch
KENSINGTON You did n't
He 's asleep
KENSINGTON How 's Austin
Great
KENSINGTON Oh hello Vanessa How was the flight
OK Scott no one really wants to kill anyone here They say it but they do n't mean it
EVIL I just think like he hates me I really think he wants to kill me
Scott
EVIL No he 's really evil
We do n't label people here Scott
EVIL I do n't know I was thinking maybe I 'd be a vet or something cause I like animals and stuff
What do you want to do Scott
EVIL I do n't wan na take over the family business
And how do you feel about that
EVIL OK Well I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago He was partially frozen for thirty years I never knew him growing up He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
We do n't judge here
EVIL Well it 's kind of weird
So Scott why do n't we start with you Why are you here
No need I 'll call again
The technology is brand new Soon it will be more powerful We anticipate a huge demand Leave us your number We 'll be in touch
There are limits
As real as you wish Hot or cold Humid or dry Anything you like Within reason
You do n't say How real does it feel
Of course Natural weather delivered to your door on demand Down your phoneline For limited periods
Seriously
Normally we 'd be eager to oblige

Promised Who promised
AUGUST Ah beautiful Just as he promised
AUGUST You mean you do n't recall
Have we met
AUGUST You
AUGUST Out in India So character-forming for the British Not the heat Good Lord no The rain dash it A good monsoon Fifteen inches overnight A whole week of lovely rain I remember one summer in Jaipur
I so agree How did you acquire a taste for it
AUGUST You do n't get rain like you used to in England A good shower that 's the ticket Stiffens resolve puckers the spirit quells the namby-pamby in a man
I 've come to apply for membership in Brolly
Really what happened in 1922
No women Not in Boodles Not since 1922
I have an appointment
Then you ca n't come in
As you see
You are female
Impossible
I 'm afraid that 's impossible
Mr John Steed please
May I help you madam
You and I Together But first you must confront your greatest enemy Who could that be Mrs Peel The answer is obvious
Then who wins
People too
Rules are made to be broken
Quite right but we still make the rules
This is n't a game
Congratulations Mrs Peel You have been a worthy opponent You have tracked us down You are within an ace of winning
We have met
Your voice it 's so familiar
If nature gives a man a collector 's mind it does n't matter what he collects Butterflies Old China Penny farthings A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass
Quite a collection
Eh In here
Sir August Sir August
Thank you Steed
Ahem As I was saying perhaps another macaroon
Next assignment
About your next assignment Mrs Peel
So am I
The doors and walls are monitored Mrs Peel This is a very secure establishment
To find out who killed my husband
This is an official matter Mrs Peel No need to take it personally Where are you going
Quite frankly it could have been you
Who
A cover for us I 'm sorry
The Institute the funding
Peter Peel was a first class agent A senior operative X department Special operations He was engaged in top secret research Top priority Government approved
To you
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss To us all
I thought I was a widow My husband the only man I ever loved is dead For the rest of my life I have to live with that
We want to help
What are you trying to do to me
Watch me
You need treatment Mrs Peel You ca n't resign
I resign
After the cold war
London The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence If you can control the weather you control the world
Directed by laser Bounced by satellite Quite possible
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes
He tried to warn us
Welcome to mobile H.Q Weather 's turning quite nasty Sir August was blown to smithereens Along with half of Banffshire The Ministry 's worried
Ropes
Father will be your controller Steed here will show you the ropes
Something strange is happening And whoever knows about it does n't want us to find out
How curious
Let me guess 'Father
My number two Special assignments She 's
Looks like rain Steed
Hmmm
Close We 're so hush-hush even we know nothing about it Now let 's see there 's coconut cake date and walnut I recommend the rum baba
I 'll never marry you
Choices
What are my choices
Speaking of Peter there 's more good news You wo n't even have to change your last name You 'll always be Mrs Peel
How Wagnerian Do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own That would have amused Peter
The missing piece of the jigsaw I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter I tried to steal it from you as Dr Darling As myself I 'll be a bit less subtle With this ring my plan will be complete
One very small thing A diamond 'cyclone chip A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size If I possess that my powers would be unlimited My dear half-brother was developing it But he suspected sabotage He gave the chip to you 'Mrs Peel I want you But also your ring
Then what 's stopping you
Chaos Transport paralysis Crop failure Economic disaster Frostbite or sunburn on a massive scale You 've seen a few samples
The result would be
Destruction of their local weather systems I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air
Such as
Entirely On the other hand Mad people get things done Let me show you
You 're mad
That 's better I say is n't this where you came in It 's impenetrable by the way
Ring
Right bridesmaid Now what have I left out Oh yes I know the ring
Valentine listen to me
You know I believe she 's actually jealous
Come come you 're a widow a most attractive widow Now I think of it we 'll need a bridesmaid Here
I 'm already married
Think of this as your second wedding feast
Oh no Emma They 've only just begun
'Our revels now are ended
You disappoint me Emma Ca n't you guess For you It was all for you
But why
Of course I planned that too
But I found you All the clues led me here
Spoil the majority shareholders In Wonderland Weather I planned everything even the Ministry recruiting you
Too many cooks
For starters Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears as well
You killed my husband
An unholy trinity
Dr Darling Peter all you
A slight miscalculation my face was burned beyond recognition Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy
Darling Emma yes we the true genius behind the Prospero Project
You
Thanks Valentine
Good luck Peter Emma
Must be Trubshaw 's busy I 'll send Mother
Ah sun tan lotion Any shops nearby
Pity your mother came too
Our chaperon
Not quite
Our little paradise just made for two
It 's the latest thing Mrs Peel
I do n't recall Siberia being this warm Steed
As a matter of fact I have
Have you any place in mind
English weather You know after all we 've been through I should say we deserve a long holiday
Still a bit chilly
A fine night Mrs Peel
in a beautiful pea green boat
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea
The plot Hello we must be going
What kept you
Mrs Peel
If you 'd been through what I have you would n't
Oh and by the way I think it 's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder
But
No bother Mother and Father think I 've joined you I might as well
You need n't bother I ca n't drag you further into this After all I am still the chief suspect
Laying in supplies Mrs Peel weather may get very nasty and I 've no umbrella
Where are you going
I 'll be back
Have a look at this
Bad news Father 's looking for you Where are those bloody ministers
'The Merry Widow I might have known Where 's the reception
They 're playing your song Mrs Peel
Snuff I must insist you try some
Trubshaw again What now
Shall we
You first
When all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
Limpet bomb Small very compact From Trubshaw 's
What is it
Intoxicating Here have one of these
It 's called Black Leather
What 's that you 're wearing
Have we been invited
There 's a reception this evening Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend
You did n't tell her
Hurry What for I 'm just now
We must hurry Mrs Peel
I 'll catch you up Do n't worry he 's expecting you
Are n't you coming
You 'll find out
Why 's he called 'Invisible
His name 's Jones 'Invisible Jones
I 'm a wanted woman I know
Very well I have a friend who might be of assistance He 's at the Ministry We 'd better be careful
Not to speak of Peter and I were both loners There was nobody
Quite Any childhood friends Enemies
Or grown-ups who still like to be children
Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All children 's things
No idea who No idea why
Drat Someone wants to implicate you in this affair Mrs Peel Any idea who
I equivocated But you 're not their big worry at present It 's Dr Darling he 's disappeared
You lied
I told Mother I took care of you
As far as you trust me
You do n't trust me
No after you
After you Mrs Peel
Please do n't tell me it 's how you play the game
Winning is n't everything
I 'm playing to win
I thought you did n't
I thought you played by the rules
Are n't we all Mrs Peel
You 're playing games
Not for a moment
But you did suspect me
Is that all
Keeping a stiff upper lip
Mmm what are you doing
It was n't me you have my word
I could be convinced if I knew who poisoned me in the maze That kiss
And do you trust me
when I do n't It comes down to one thing Mrs Peel Trust
Yes
Always Except
Because you always obey orders
No trouble
I could save you the trouble
Nothing personal
To kill me
Orders
You followed me
It was Peter I saw him
I expect that 's for you to know and me to find out
Was I
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists I 'm so sorry I struck you Mrs Peel Please forgive me I thought you were someone else
Where am I
Mrs Peel
Steed
I expect we 'll have to gatecrash
Someone did n't want us to get to the party
Here 's the one that broke the camel 's back
This must be the last straw
You will let me know if you find that queen who 's in need of protection wo n't you
Barely
What Lady Disdain Are you yet breathing
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative We 're being followed I saw him at Trubshaw 's
Do you always drive this fast
Oh well Just my type Mrs Peel
Is that what you think
According to Dr Darling you 're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior Q.E.D
Not that I know of Explanation
And by you Mrs Peel Everything points to you No sisters No undiscovered twin
Then a mad millionaire Head of a secret defense establishment A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather
And by you Mrs Peel
Three agents killed by bad weather
Sounds as if someone 's hijacked your research
That 's what we were working on
But if someone miniaturized the process
Exactly There 'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea Propane gas mostly In small quantities it captures chlorine Protects the ozone layer But it proved impractical Too bulky
Filling in mother nature 's blind spots
The Prospero Project was started by my husband It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming In theory climate engineering is entirely feasible We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite A 'quick fix
Is there anything that is n't
Not quite This is my field
Do n't bother Here 's a bus
But
Thanks I see what you mean about letting me do the risking Hello
For you Mrs Peel
She had this in her mouth There there
Common knowledge Mrs Peel
Is that written in his shoe
Well he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society
Any ideas
What on earth
Very good Steed
Elementary Mrs Peel Trubshaw is n't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade
How on earth can you tell
Colonel Crabtree International Satellite Systems Formerly of the Ministry
I should have thought that was obvious I 'm in mourning
Either way may I ask why you dress in that fashion
You mean my other self
I must say you look more your old self
Did you say formal I must dress
An invitation To a 'formal picnic
No But he must know Incidentally my double left you with this
Did he say who
That 's possible Sir August was convinced he 'd met me before But I 'd never met him Another odd thing When it rained he said it was just as someone had promised
Perhaps your memory plays tricks Mrs Peel
But that 's absurd I may not be over-fond of you Steed but it 's not my style
Frankly that 's how I remember it
You told them You said I arrived on a camel shot you four times Left you for dead
Why should they think that
Mother and Dr Darling have me under observation They think I tried to kill you
I might say the same
I mean your man Trubshaw Your bullet-proof waistcoat I thought you were just overdressed
I was n't about to
You were very lucky Four shots to the heart I found you after I slipped away from Sir August Mother brought you here Not me you should thank
Strange
You should be dead How do you feel
Ah Brenda Mrs Peel
Small talk Try the weather
So I distract him while you snoop around How
All of a piece really A fanatical weatherman Chairman of BROLLY British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years Thinks British weather has been tampered with by aliens
Any other vices
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
June July August
Not so much eccentric More barking mad He has a wife called June And a daughter somewhere Julie
An eccentric recluse
According to Mother Sir August owns half of the Highlands A millionaire Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry Now
I meant me
No thanks
After our fencing match I was rather hoping you would do the risking More tea
I have no choice Why should you risk your life
They call me in when they 've reached a dead end Freelance Like yourself
Just what is your position if you do n't mind my asking How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work
For a man in my position
Do we always follow Mother 's instructions
As per mother 's instructions
Sir August Merryweather why are we seeing him first
That 's predictable When I find a queen in need of protection I 'll let you know
The most unpredictable piece on the board And always ready to protect his queen
And I suppose you 're the knight
A Gentleman has to have a code This is part of mine A uniform Think of it as my suit of shining armor
But why What 's the point
Not all Tradition is bad Mrs Peel No thank you
You know what I mean This car and you Nobody walks around like that Milk
Do you really think so
That place is so absurd so out of date
Thank you Trubshaw
You can but I wish you would n't
Ahh Perfect fit The luxury of a hand-made shoe As unique as a face or a fingerprint Or should I say DNA
Steed we really must be
Or half cocked
Oh absolutely but Trubshaw 's a man worth meeting No point setting out half shod
I thought we were on our way
Yes indeed I need protection
Do you
I had a feeling you would Touche
Really I fail to see the connection
My father always wanted a boy
A kipper Or a red herring What were they investigating
Ah From Trubshaw 's My shoemaker
We 're not here to talk about the weather surely
Showers followed by sunny periods
Mother
I did n't Mother did
And now that we 've settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you
Much better
Under the circumstances you may call me Mrs Peel
I say this is all terribly formal Must I go an calling you Dr Peel
And just what is the game
Not by me Play by the rules Doctor or the game is nothing
Rules are made to be broken
Dyed in the wool But I can admire someone who does n't play by the rules
Whereas you are
Congratulations you 've penetrated a bastion of male privilege I guessed you were n't a stickler for Tradition doctor
So what was all this some sort of test
Red herring would have been too obvious do n't you think
1922 Why the kippers
I should n't wonder Not a woman inside Boodles since
I had a spot of bother at the door
I was about to throw in the towel
And you must be Steed Please do n't get up
Doctor Peel I presume
And you 've a new wardrobe He does want you to look attractive He tells me you 're very beautiful
Decontamination
Emma in Wonderland Welcome Mrs Peel We 've been expecting you We hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us Decontamination is almost complete
It 's Mother you have to convince He 's very agitated Wait here
You do n't believe him
Mobile HQ In a blue funk Ca n't take chances I 'm looking after things while he 's hiding out
Where 's Mother
You 're saying I have no choice
Think of it as special assignment Mrs Peel With a twist You 're our chief suspect
I 'm no spy where do I fit in
Your mission is simple Find out how and why these agents died
I 'm going to find out who killed my husband Will you take these documents to Steed
JONES You 're not venturing alone surely
I shall need a small plane
JONES Very good Mrs Peel
Let me guess Wonderland Weather
JONES Privately owned by
and now
JONES X marks the spot The shoes were delivered to an island in Hyde Park Surrounded by the Serpentine On the site of a former Ministry installation
Well I ca n't possibly go like this
JONES Under the circumstances Mother did n't see fit but I think I can get you in
I fail to see
JONES The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative
Getting to what
JONES I was getting to it
Are you suggesting that Dr Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together But that 's absurd
JONES Makes two of us
Who 's now vanished
JONES Father She gave him an 'all clear after a security test by Dr Darling
Surveillance By whom
JONES Do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother in-law was under surveillance
I know all this
JONES Now let 's see Eton Cambridge research into robotics and plastics Overtaken by Peter 's work on the physics of climate change
JONES Half-brother to be precise
Peter 's brother But
JONES Ah here we are Steed asked me to play a hunch Valentine Peel
JONES Or rather you do n't Learnt the tricks in camouflage Till this accident made a prang of things How can I help you Mrs Peel
I see
JONES Talk to the pipe Mrs Peel That usually helps Do n't worry about me being invisible Other than that I 'm perfectly normal
Well you found me Have a sniff of this why do n't you Careful the scent can be overpowering
Mother betrayed me She was going to replace me with a younger Father Errand boy that 's all I was 'Find Steed
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance you 're the mole who betrayed the Ministry
You reek of Mrs Peel 's Black Leather
How did you guess
Steed
Dead I 'm afraid
We want Mrs Peel
Oh hello
So you say
We know one thing That suspect was not Mrs Peel
Jungle plants in the Arctic A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland Blizzards in summer
Global warming
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns
I 'm warning you for the last time Steed whoever 's behind all this looks like Mrs Peel walks like Mrs Peel and kills like Mrs Peel
In your operation
Where
I 'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own If I 'm right Mrs Peel is innocent and you have a mole
You 're getting yourself into terrible trouble my son Weather 's turning very nasty and so am I
I was hoping you could tell me
Mother and Father know best
Guilty until proven innocent
Pity I was growing fond of Mrs Peel Unfortunately
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation On the day he died he was setting a test To prove to himself to us that his wife was beyond suspicion He had to be certain He said he was going to give Mrs Peel something
You 're accusing Mrs Peel of killing her own husband
No Her husband she says Alice tried to warn us A trap Tell Mother beware Tell Father That 's all
This man did you see him
Impossible
Too late anyway Today 's escapade was only for starters This is no ordinary weather It 's manmade A kind of weather bomb
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late Someone tipped them off
You
Anyone particular in mind
Still does n't Better safe than sorry She was in a dangerous game Steed High stakes She may prove to be a risk If she is there 's only one solution Termination
How come you took so much interest in her Dr Darling
Something went wrong System malfunction Explosion Mrs Peel had a narrow escape Suspected sabotage Nothing proven File still open
She may try to kill you
Why
Who knows If Dr Darling is right you should watch out
Insane
Possibly Split personality
Amnesia
She may not know Theory goes she may be very ill
Think she really killed those agents
Perhaps I 'd better start calling you doctor again Mrs Peel
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming had they succeeded We need your expertise
Oh yes I did I want you to meet somebody I expect you 'll like her
You did n't come to talk about the weather surely
Weather 's turning nasty
Brenda and I thought we 'd drop in
Mother I thought you were burglars
LADY This way
Wonderland Weather Ltd
You do n't say Like looking for a needle in a
LADY Good Glad to see they 're together at last They do n't get along Promotion Top job Most unfair Quite a fuss at the Ministry
Both actually
LADY You with Mother or Father
She was

You are and it 's behind you

Rules are made to be broken
That 's not playing by the rules
One shot for emergencies
You wish
Bang-bang you 're dead
But did they teach you this
I was at Harrow
You 're better than I expected
Perish the thought

I just want to be alone
C'mon Larry Be good for you
Guys I think I 'd rather stay here
What do you mean it changes
She hates me It 's over You 'll see as soon as you get married everything changes You sure you want to go through with it man
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while
My marriage is the worst All crap A big pile of shit
Right
Naw two on a Quaalude bad luck
You want to share it
Your attention please May I be the first to say It 's a raid
You 're all under arrest Open up
I see what you mean You 're a beautiful guy And you 're doing a damn good job
Keep your voices down This is a respectable establishment We do n't go for any funny business here Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys
What do you know they moved it Catch you later

I hate him so much sometimes Stephen You do n't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on
Jesus you been carrying that around for twenty years For christ 's sake you were seven years old You think he could have heard you in there
I saw it before it got them I tried to yell but He asked me to look out for him And I did n't do it I let him die
Everybody did

So hello
Just Just wanted to say hello
Hey what are you doing here
Fuck you
He did n't listen He was a fucking candidate He was your responsibility He should n't have been there in the first place Stephen You burned him
I had that fire He did n't listen
Had to take on another fire bare handed huh Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie Is that what happened Is it Stephen
Not now Brian
Just leave me alone okay
Brian look
Thanks for the insight
Look you are sorta making yourself fair game
You said you wanted to know something Brian What did you learn today What do you say Brian huh Time to move on
Dad 's way Where did he tell you that In a fucking seance
That 's not what it 's about Brian The point is there was a kid in there And what if there 'd been two I went in because that 's what I do It 's my way It 's dad 's way It is n't everybody 's way
I waited I would have fucking waited
You okay
Listen to it Brian Jump when I say It wo n't get us

You split the team man And what was that crap with the standpipe You 'd think you and a hose were never introduced before
C'mon Stephen
Y'know you got an awful short memory for direct orders I told you to stay beside me
Hook us up to a stand-pipe
I 'm in heaven Lt
Ya love it probie
I think you 're gon na find out Brian Do n't be late tomorrow
I got ta do this Stephen I got ta know
Yeah you know You know what it felt like
Y'know I told myself a million times I did n't want to be a fireman I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy I know I split and I know how you felt
Thanks for the speakers
There 's only so much technology can do Thanks for the beer
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie that I do n't think is going to make it
So that 's it Big bad brother 's gon na ride my ass till I cough blood
I know you cold Brian The scary thing is you probably could have faked it for awhile But you see in this job there 's no place to hide Is n't like selling log cabins You have a bad day here someone dies And that 's not fucking good enough Want another beer
Hey You do n't know me
What is it with you man huh How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up That scotch bullshit Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz You were bankrupt man
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment I mean is this really gon na have to one of those big brother little brother you broke my GI Joe and I 'm still pissed games
Why 'd you come here Brian
That was never proved
Yeah What about Laura
Sheep do n't count
Millions Stephen And sexual favors
People actually used to pay you for this
It worked when you were in sixth grade
It works
In the Field Museum once
What you 've never seen one before
My God an actual operating 8-track
It 's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway Still good enough though for this tub
Been ripping off fire stations
It 's comin along want a beer
I like what you 've done with the place
Well see you 're wrong already Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald and we decided in the interest of brotherly love that maybe you should n't be way over on the other side of town So starting tomorrow your assigned to company 17 My company One case of scotch you 're getting cheap in your old age Brian
Not likely
Does n't work on you See ya around little brother
So you 're going to fight fires now huh
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation Stephen It was a great inspiration to me
Well look what we have here Nice costume Rent it
If you do it like that it 'll open in the fire Then you 'll get burned and DIE
Who asked you
It does n't go like that
It 's a small town
I 'll see ya around huh
I do n't have the slightest idea
What 'll you do
I quit two days ago Brian
I think your boss is going to need some spin control
You 're right
That 's a dumb thing to say
I 'm sorry
Just take it
What is
Your boss is lying Jennifer
Y'know four years ago I was working in a bakery Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he did n't even know my name I run that office now Marty believed in me and I believe in him You want me to just throw that away
Yes
Do you know what you 're asking me to do
You could check It 'd be in his files
I do n't know anything about it
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered I want to know why he keeps that hidden
We still talking Look I 'm sorry about the other day
Hi
Hi
You knew what we were asking you to do Do n't suddenly pull out a conscience now The fit is n't right
I work for the city
Oh yeah he 's the real fireman Who are you Just another probie working for Swayzak
Leave Stephen out of this
Let me ask you something do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills Who the hell are you kidding I was there remember I saw you and your brother
Yeah And just how much of all this has been doing your job
I was doing my job
You could have scared the son of a bitch off We may never bust him now All for a couple 's political points
Will you please keep your voice down there 's people
Bullshit You knew what I told you was n't ready for the papers
I did n't know it was a secret There are n't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators
You told Swayzak about our arson lead It 's all over the fucking news
Brian What 's wrong
Uh huh
Well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment This area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose
I wanted to be a good one
Then why did you quit
When I came back I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman
Do you miss it You seem like you do
See that trap door up there That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines It was pretty different then but kinda the same y'know
Homey
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city Lotta tradition locked up in here What do you think
Oh there might be something stashed away for emergencies
Got anything to drink in there
Thanks for the invite
In a dinosaur kinda way yeah
But Rimgale 's probably going to come around to arson
Jesus give him a break There is n't enough proof yet to go public Sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em and we 've maybe figured out why backdrafts but you ca n't rush this stuff Not 'till it 's locked
Yeah but it does n't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
No he 's more of a dinosaur Guy 's not a dummy though He 's juggling alot of balls on this one
Boy Rimgale 's as slow as a snail is n't he
Okay
Marty did But I wanted you to come to
Well you did invite me here
You think that 's really any of your business
Sorry Are you dating anyone
If you were n't at least the 300th person to ask me that I 'd probably be pissed Boy you sure know it 's a man 's world sometimes
Hey So are you dating your boss or what
Hi
Yeah Well maybe I can fit it in
I could use a date
I do n't know I 'm kinda swamped here
Green committed to a thousand There 's another fund-raising party tonight Marty 'd really like you to come
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour
How 's it going
Hey
Straightest answer your department 's given me all week
Arson
Yeah
Okay I 'll arrange things with your assignment captain Marty 's a good man Brian
I 've been thinking about what you said the other night If the offer 's still on the table I 'd like to talk about it
Hey sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss But I 'm not gon na be a poster boy for him I 'm trying to do something here There 's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them
Look I did n't mean to take a piece out of you back there I just thought you 'd call when you came back You did n't and Do n't blow it just because of this garbage between us
So now you suddenly care about my future
Brian do you always have to be so stupid Think about your future for once
C'mon Jennifer he 's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth
Boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II
Yeah well I like to think I 'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters
What was that Oh man you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard
Bullshit Marty 's plan is only about efficiency I 've got two cousins on the job you think I 'd work for him if I did n't believe in it
All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
Why do you think Marty came here tonight Because he cares about your department You do n't know how hard he works You do n't know about his programs helping West Side
Yeah Swayzak Humanity 's last hope How can you work for that guy
Let me tell you something Martin Swayzak is going to be this town 's next mayor
Carrying Swayzak 's notebook
Look I 'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night This is n't about fun I 'm working here
Oooh very sophisticated Having fun
When I was twenty
With grenadine right
I do n't want to be your friend Brian
Well if nothing else it 's nice to know we can still be friends
What you think I just dried up and blew away when you left The world does turn once in awhile Brian even without your permission
Really No kidding
I work for city hall
Yeah What have you been up to
Not quite Just visiting I live in Lincoln Park now
So I see you 're still in the neighborhood
Huh
Uh I 've been sorta keeping a low profile the academy I graduated today
Thanks for calling
You look great
You 're back
Jennifer
Brian
Not such a far walk after all is it Brian
Oh Jesus Christ
After it took your dad the fire did it look at you Brian Did it talk to you
Who the fuck is doing this
Good So our two heroes Adcox and McCaffrey they go back inside Only there 's another fire in there nobody sees And it took your dad did n't it Brian Did you see him burn
Trychticholorate
That 's a probie answer You 're smarter than that Brian
The outlets
Very good Brian About your report here The way to a torch 's heart is through his tools That 's how you know him It 's the way he talks to the fire And to you if you listen
I wanted to be him Right then I wanted to be him more than anything
Right Light smoke low roll Couple a civilians hollering medium deal So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across what were you feeling Brian C'mon you promised Be honest Okay Guard
I I thought it was great I loved it It was nothing to these guys medium deal
You got ta tell a story too Brian It 's fair C'mon do n't think too hard
What
Famous story even Straight burn Just an engine and truck first on scene What did you feel Brian when you first got there
Sure you do
I do n't have a story
No no your turn Tell me a story
Then who
Your first question should be who is n't It is n't a spark Brian Not enough damage And an insurance pro Where 's the profit margin
Who 's doing this
Okay here 's the deal I 'll tell you a story you tell me one Fair
So you came to me Well this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
I 'm close but I ca n't get who it is
Hey do I know you
Brian McCaffrey Oh this is really a treat Brian McCaffrey Lost a dad to the animal huh
See you Monday Sir
FITZGERALD Even if you graduate this academy you 've still got nine months of probation That 's hard duty son If you do n't really love this job it 'll kill you
No it is n't out of your hands or you would n't even have met me If I push you have to let me back in Dead Hero Father Rule Sir
FITZGERALD Sorry but it 's out of my hands Try again next year
I need another one sir
FITZGERALD I do n't give a damn what your test scores were maybe you could have been a good firemen but you had your shot
If you remember sir my test scores were in the top
FITZGERALD Look everybody remembers your old man Being his son all you had to do was breathe to graduate here Dead Hero Father Rule But you blew us off Why should I take you back
I want another shot Sir
FITZGERALD You walked out on this academy six years ago One week to graduation You think we forgot that You think I did
If it was a joke sir you 'd be laughing
Like it never happened
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city Is that how it 's going to read You 're the only one that knows
Yeah
Your brother was a good man
I 've been lying here hours just thinking We 're close We 're not looking in the right place Brian This one knows us and we 're not looking in the right place
So what do you want me to do
I hate hospitals You 're so so goddamn useless
Just wondering
No
Did I say thanks
Yeah
Did you pull me out
How ya feeling
Well Brian I guess you can say it 's arson now
It had to be someone who knows numbers Some kind of fancy accountant But what 's the connection
Then who wrote the report
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report They did exactly one job Swayzak 's manpower study It 's not even really a company No employees no directors just a PO Box
I 've got three different drafts of the same report with different numbers that 're all over the place Looks like they were just making it up as they went along
Yeah Airtight
This is the copy of Swayzak 's manning report that was released Everybody on this job knows it 's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers They 're all airtight
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces Swayzak 's up to his ass in this somehow Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand he 's so scared
Nice bunch of guys
And Cosgrove Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate They were n't very high on Seagrave either
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants
Son of a bitch They knew each other
Hey boss Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics which is a division of Windy City Ventures who 's partners are Alan Seagrave Donald Cosgrove and Jeffrey Holcomb
Fire
In a word Brian what is this job all about
I 'm finished with Swayzak I 'll do whatever you want me to do I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim You got ta give me another shot
What the hell are you doing here
No Do that and I guarantee you 'll scare him off I do n't want him running away
Are you going public with this
No we have a stone killer trying to make a point
That 's why the sealant on the doors So what have we got a torch with a conscience
Why backdrafts Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out
What reason
But he could have killed everybody there The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall The backdraft blew out the flame That 's it That 's the reason
But he killed these guys
I got it after we talked to Ronald Torches Want to fry the whole goddamn world But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls And he made his burns backdrafts
What
That 's it Oh that son of a bitch he 's different goddamn it You see what this tells us huh Our killer does n't love fire
I do n't work for them either
Some people say you do n't do much of anything when it comes to this case
I do n't guess
But the right guess on this is arson
Even if it was used to seal the air off that does n't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft A gun 's a helluva lot easier
And the putty around the door
Look it is n't proof okay Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove 's clothes
Trychticholorate Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen Would n't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire Problem 's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace unless you could find something that would eat its residue
Ever burned magnesium It 's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM
During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher Trych breaks down and dissipates Will consume magnesium
Go to the bottom Under heat properties
Trychtichlorate is a binary structured
Read
I just re-wrote your contract C'mere
Uh I do n't think that 's in my contract
No it could n't
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire
Another backdraft
Glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion Lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn Explosion must of come after a slow burn You little tease What were you up to you little bastard huh What made you that mad Or scared It started in this room Took its time hung out but the air ran out It could n't breathe So it was snuffed But it was n't dead still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air
Do we have a language barrier here Glass
Glass
So you were happy here Warm and cozy and in no hurry Soot high clean unburned wall low indicates slow burn in thermal balance Find me some glass
What are you listening to
Shhh

Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone Brian This could be a great opportunity to move beyond a fire engine
Yeah we got all kinds of traditions like dying young
This one 's still with the fire department One of our best investigators Don Rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now We think he could use another pair of hands and you 're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
I have a job

There 's no replacement 'cause of your boss cuts if that 's what you mean If someone else goes out on an injury we 're really screwed
So you surviving without me
Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey on his very first fire showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father 's death

Yesterday morning God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him Not my arms or my legs but something I used for the first time for the last time and will never use again My vagina
Yes Sister
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning and my sin You see Father
I think of running for help and falling to my knees in prayer
I also thought of that bread Father And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died and I kept the cool damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist Father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God
It 's funny you knew But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen Maybe that 's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt
Father if it was so trivial so natural so No I have sinned And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition and to absolve me Father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God
Sister we all know what happened to you yesterday morning I expected that you would want to speak to me about it But you could have come to my office Your being here in the confessional implies that you Sister have done something wrong You have n't I assure you I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of curiosity or even pleasure you must n't
Forgive me Father for I have sinned It has been two days since my last confession Father my sin is a terrible sin A sin of omission There was another sin that happened at the same time and in the same place but my sin I think was graver stil

I would like to change your name
That 's right Money turns the wheel
DeLa I 'm aboard As long as I get to hoof and get paid too
Trust me Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss but we 'll have an answer one way or the other
How different
Where do I sign
Some tap dancing some singing
What do I have to do
EUREKA
My tap shoes
Well do something about it
Manray Sloan says you 're too talented to be dancing on the street
Can I finish Thank you I had a great Aunt we called her Sister She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon
BYRD Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust
Do n't you people get it We 're in the 21st Century Slavery was over four hundred years ago All that stuff people talked in the old days it 's over Folks always crying white man this white man that Let 's all grow up
BYRD But the line has to be drawn
Yes And I say yes because who is to judge Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not Who Who can play God
BYRD No matter how sexist or racist the material may be
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country Gary I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show it 's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist that 's when I get mad No one in any way shape or form should be censored
BYRD Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN Let 's get right into it You have been called by some in the community a traitor a sellout an Uncle Tom Why does your show generate such feelings
I want to meet her one day please tell her the great news I 'm OUT like Vanilla Ice
I gots to go it 's my Moms
Hello Mommy let me get rid of this other call
Hold on a sec I got a call
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier From the gitgo from jump street
This has to be a big mistake
They did n't even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together
Yo DeLa I just got the news from the CNS brass They saw some clips from the pilot and they 're rushing it onto the air Yo we 're a midseason replacement ordered 12 shows We 're on in 3 weeks Didya hear what I just said Yo
I seriously doubt that will ever happen Did n't I tell you I know your people better than you do But if by some miracle you 're correct I 'm gon na invite them inside my house and we 'll have a sit down discuss it like civil human beings
Funnier to who and at who 's expense Dunwitty when Negroes start to run amok the boycotts when the demostrations commence I 'm giving them your home address Let 's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich Connecticut
We just punched it up a bit Made it funnier
I do n't give a good goddamn about Finland Norway Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from
Calm down please
I will not be held responsible for these revisions These changes are not the way I want to go This is an outrage This is a sham A violation
Dunwitty do n't leave
I 'm gon na leave you two creative geniuses alone
Derrick Coleman he possessed all the talent in the world coulda shoulda been a great ballplayer but alas D.C did n't want it bad enough Delacroix do you want it Bad enough to kill for it Do you want it that much
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO
No Just meet the guy That 's all I 'm asking Look I 'll even let you choose your own musical director You can have that
That 's exactly my point Has he even directed actors before in anything
If Spielburg can direct The Color Purple and Amistad our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video
Probably nuthin but that 's why it 's such a sexy way to go Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective A black director y'know what he 's gon na do given the subject matter With this kid the possibilities are endless
Besides what does he know about Negroes
I just want you to meet him Keep an open mind
You 're telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot
I want a hot young white director Maybe the kid that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself if not the pilot soon after
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right It 's un-American I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm One misstep and we 're doing Amos and Andy Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain
Sleep n Eat what do you do
We think so
That'swhatI'mtalkin bout That'swhatI'mtalkin bout He 's off the hiz-hook
What are you talkin 'bout It 's the move Stay wid me now We 're movin fast What does everybody else think about this
I do n't know about that plantation angle
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry make us laugh make us look at our own humanity Make us feel good to be alive
Ya first bad move Projects been done That 's one of the problems now everything movies TV are set in the urban jungle da hood That 's so tired Mantan 's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation In Alabama
In the projects Like Eddie Murphy 's The PJ 's
We gon na hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis one What 's the setting
Do we have characters How about Honeycutt Snowflake Rastus Nigger Jim Sambo Jungle Bunny and how could we forget Aunt Jemima
Who are the other characters
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer He has educated feet
So what We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that No such thing as bad publicity So what Earlier you said singing and dancing
Negroes would be in an uproar
Let'em try I will kill to make this happen
Protest finally forced Amos and Andy off the air Could stop us from ever getting on
This could be bigger than Amos and Andy
Yep you guessed it
And Sleep n Eat is his comical sidekick
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire
Exactly
Ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky
What are there character traits
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons Mantan and Sleep n Eat The Dusky Duo
I want you take it there All the way to the edge and back
Mantan and Sleep n Eat Two real coons I know we 're way out there but it 's satire
That 's a great handle
Are these our two stars sitting here in front of my nose Which one is Mantan again
I do n't know if Whoopi is the way to go
Do n't worry about that that 's my department Now who do we cast We need a star Can Whoopi sing or dance
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air In fact I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial
I 'm feelin dis
I 'm lovin it You know how I know Because I 'm getting a boner my Johnson is hard no disrespect my sister
It is called MANTAN THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW
The name of the show
So let 's take this great form this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
Word
I know you 're familiar with minstrel shows They came about at the turn of the 19th century It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface singing dancing telling jokes doing skits Dunwitty I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air Carol Burnett HeeHaw
Go on Good so far
I 've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right In my previous work it 's been all surface superficial I have never really dug deep Not anymore As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way Race has always been a hot button in this country 's history and it needs to be pushed harder If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony It 's about promoting racial healing
I 'm wid it
We 're all happy to be here and I 'm going to paint a picture for you
It 's right and tight Good morning let me introduce you to everybody You know my assistant Sloan
Delacroix I 'm glad you got your mind right
Yes Yes Yes I want a show that will make headlines that will have millions and millions of households tuned in glued to their televisions every week I want advertisers dying to buy on this show I 'm gon na squeeze this show out of you if it kills you
What is it you want from me Some plantation follies Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads You want me to go back to the ante bellum days
You will or you 'll be back at BET so quick you 'll never know what hit you I need a mid-season replacement and pronto It will be on the fast track
I 'm not sure if I can deliver what you want
That 's exactly what I think I want you to create something that people want to see Let 's be honest the majority of the people in the country are deaf dumb and blind and I 'm including 35 million African-Americans You know and I know niggers set the trend set the styles This is a golden opportunity now These idiots have to be led to the water
I 'm an oreo a sell out Because I do n't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER A PJ 's or some as you might put it some nigger show I 'm a Tom I 'm whiter than white and you 're blacker than black Is that what you think
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways Brother man I 'm blacker than you I 'm keepin it real and you 're frontin trying to be white
I 've never been given a fair shot
Delacroix wake up brother man The reason why they did n't get picked up was because nobody and I mean NOBODY niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk
to white I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son And so on and so forth It 's too clean too antiseptic
I 'm telling you it 's not
I do n't agree The Negro middle class does exist and it 's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom
The material you 've been creating is too white bread White people with black faces The Huxtable 's Cosby revolutionary But that 's dead We ca n't go down that road again
NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence
I understand Black culture I grew up around black people all my life If the truth be told I probably know niggers better than you Monsieur Delacroix Please do n't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word I got a black wife and three bi-racial children so I feel I have a right to use that word I do n't give a damn what Spike says Tarantino is right Nigger is just a word If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I
Forget it I believe you 're my most creative person I 've got on staff You 're hip You know what 's happening I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me
I understand But again in all honesty I was not informed
I 'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting
C.P Time is Colored People 's Time The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late That Negroes have no sense of time time except when it comes to music or dance
Do you know what C.P Time is
I was n't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you
Four minutes ago
I did n't find out about this very important staff meeting until
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone
I 'm sorry I 'm late
exactly thirty-two minutes ago
Always keep 'em laughing
I love you too Daddy
Baby you treat me so good Peerless you 're a good son I love you You never gave me no trouble
Let 's get him over to the bed
In life I'ma keep on living having a good drink got me a good young woman make a couple of dollars and make people laugh Have n't I always tol you all nigga 's are entertainers The question is what are you gon na do Peerless
I did n't mean that in life
Three nights Charleston South Carolina
Where do you go from here
The truth is never let them seeya sweat You do that that 's half the battle
Nuthin I ca n't handle
Dem white boys giving you a hard time
The same old same old Trying to get my stuff through
Enough about me what 's happening with you
All I know is what happened to me All that other mess I just file into the life 's too short category
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
That 's the only reason period They only want one certain kind of black comic
Daddy it ca n't be just because of that There had to be other factors
Because I had too much pride Too much integrity I would n't lick nobody 's butt Some material I refused to do
That 's what I 'm askin
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell Virginny Is that what you 're asking ya Daddy
How did you end up here
I did I 'm not an alcoholic I just like to drink
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped
Purely for medicinal purposes
My game is still strong No Viagra for me do n't need no chemicals Just my tonic
Daddy she 's younger than me
Good woman I trained her right
Pleased to meet you
Pull up a chair Oh excuse me this is my lady DOT
It 's been a long time
Son Good to seeya Good to seeya
It 's me Peerless
Go away unless you got my money
I want to speak with you
What do you want
He did the best way he knew how Junebug is stubborn just like you
He never showed it
Your father is proud of you
Do n't tell him it 's from me or he wo n't take it
I was a hostess at this club your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life He asked me to come with him I quit my job and we 've been together ever since
So what 's up with you
The drinking is for the pain It does n't kill it just dulls it
So he drank himself into a stuper
Not that often He was excited to see you
How long has my father been like this
Is that so
Glad to meet you too You are all your father talks about
Give me the gun
I told you but you would n't listen You never listened to me
I did n't think this was in your studies at NYU
Do n't make me have to use this
And that 's how you got me in the first place
DeLa kiss my big black ass
Otherwise I trust you know the difference You 're an intelligent woman finished at NYU
Work related or otherwise
The first and only time A big mistake I 'm gon na have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore
That was a mistake but I do n't regret it
That 's why it will be so much fun
This is crazy
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody I know where I made my big mistake I have a general rule never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light This bucket of blood
Light
DeLa you should try it sometime Come into the light
Do you have to be so damn forthright
I ca n't lie to him If he asks me something I tell him what I think
Dunwitty and I feel you 've been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
Please do n't go there
Oh is he You getting jiggy with Mantan
He 's just playing big brother
That crazy brother of yours does n't think so
You 're the one that put us together We 're friends
How long have you and Hambone been hangin out
I do n't want to hear it
Why 'd you do that
To me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior sub-human
How so
It 's all good You got a hit show you 're gon na need a bank Plus I love these old black collectibles
Is that good or bad
I thought it was appropiate
Thanks
This is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
The Jolly Nigger Bank
No matter what you think you did come up with something unique Open it
For what
A gift
What is this
A small victory is n't that small when you 've been use to losing
So you have your small victory now what
Everybody shut up
What would their reaction be I had n't the foggiest
I 'm sorry I ca n't help it It 's too funny
Who 's side are you on
C'mon You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family You gave your brother a shot That 's all anybody can ask for an opportunity a chance a shot He got his
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau 's I should not have imposed them on you
The pleasure is mine
Same here
Just do n't lie to me
What do you want me to say
We both lied to him
Let 's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
Your life will never be the same
Break a leg
Just want to say good luck
I 'm gon na slit my wrists Cut my throat For the love of Joseph
You 've said that already
The big one
Which one is your brother
This is the group I was telling you about
I 've never worked with any of you and you 've never worked with me so we 'll be starting from scratch I 'm a fair person a straight shooter and I do n't hold my tongue Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired
Hello
Good morning for those of you who do n't know me I 'm Pierre Delacroix I 'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins
Like I said all this for some twisted distorted sense of principal Dunwitty he just tolerates your Negroidal ass he does n't respect it
I would n't bet against it My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
What 's the chances of MANTAN being picked up
Even if money was n't an issue Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
Fuck da money Why do through all this effort Why Are you looking for love from Dunwitty For respect Dunwitty and his likes do n't give a goddamn about you So now what are you gon na do
It was the principle Dunwitty had to be enlightened I was making a point I take pride in my work Plus I already told you I was n't gon na walk away from my money
Why did you even come up with that shit if you did n't want it made
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW
What is your problem
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
You okay
This is Cheeba
Hello
Manray better not be bleeding to death I need him After we 're done he can do whatever he wants to do until then he 's ours
Maybe something happened to them Maybe they 're lying in an alley bleed to death
And lose out on my money The only way I get paid is if I get fired And that 's what I intend to do
Ca n't you just quit Walk away
Good I 'm going to need your support
I 'm in till the end
You getting cold feet
Sounds risky to me
The point being that him the networks do n't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons
What point is that
Dunwitty wants a Coon show And that 's what I 'm going to give him it 's going to be so racist so negative he wo n't have the balls to put it on the air Hence I 'll prove my point
You lost me
Not yet but this thing will never get made
Do you know how you will use him
Manray was under our nose the whole time
The idea was out there in the universe Now what
How can this be You and me at the same time the exact same thought It 's scary
It hit me like a ton of bricks
How did you know
Manray
Manray
It was n't my fault If I would have known I would have known
What good are you if you do n't tell me stuff like this
Nobody told me anything
Why did n't you tell me about this staff meeting
How was it
I 've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin 's LAUGH-IN
David I appreciate your comments Anybody got an ideas Everybody just talk out loud
This thing was rigged the deck was stacked the fix was in Could Don King be near Good thing Sloan had my back She 's my rock This was going to be a whole lot of work
Oh is that what I 'm doing
I perfectly understand where you 're coming from As a minority I can relate to your struggle also But I think you should give us all a chance We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you Please do n't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
Hi Mona
He I 'm Mona
Yes your name
Kook and the Gang it 's Manray Let 's do the taping You go back to your dressing room get dressed and blacken up
My name is Manray goddamnit
Mantan we got a show to tape
Do I have to spell it out for you In fact go ask Sloan yourself
I do n't believe it
Let me ask you a question if I may How do you think she got the job in the first place I do n't mean to burst your bubble Mantan the Marvelous but Sloan is an opportunity
Sloan is the hardest working person I 've ever met
Oh is it Buddy boy in this business if people do n't produce they get fired
What you did is dead wrong
You should n't even be mad at me over Sloan
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up
Yeah
You 've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost Do n't you know you should never let them see you sweat Y'knowwhatI'msayin
Yo DeLa they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
You getting scared because some people do n't like what you are doing
No
What are you A man or a mouse Are you a punk Punking out on me
In time
Hope the same thing does n't happen to me That 's some big shoes to fill
No joke Serious
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal Besides there is no such thing as bad publicity
Same thing Giuliani said
This is nothing It will blow over by tomorrow
You sound like the media
So they can be on TV
Sloan will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready
Not nervous Relaxed
I feel fine
You feel good not nervous
Naw I 'll take the zero
Can I kiss you too
The point I 'm trying to make is that this is a blessing It 's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way
Now I 'm privileged Why Because I did n't grow up on food stamps and welfare Because I did n't call home a cardboard box No I never ever went to bed hungry and I 'm proud of it too Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
That 's the way it came out Let me ask you one question Have you ever been in want in need your entire privileged life
I did n't mean it to sound like that
Pressure DeLa you do n't know what the hell real pressure is SHEEETT This is lightstuff Now when you scramblin out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
I 'm happy for all of us It 's just we have a great responsibility now The pressure is on
Soon
I wo n't forget When are you coming up here to see your mother
If and when he calls please do n't forget to ask him if he 's seen Mantan
You know how your Daddy is
Not at all
No
Yes I have very hard Has Daddy called
Of course I 'm happy for you You 've worked very hard for your success
You going to attack me too The show is a hit Are n't you happy for me
I 'm doing okay Been reading about your show it 's all over everywhere I watched it 's all over everywhere I watched it once I thought you said there would be no buffoonery
Peerless last time go see your father
C'mon Mommy Daddy has n't been impressed with anything I 've ever done From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present
Even more reason to see him He 'll be overjoyed with your success
It 's gon na be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
Regardless he still is your father
I do n't even know why you 're still concerned over him Daddy 's not with you
Richmond is not all the way down south
I ca n't go all the way down south
He 's performing at some place outside of Richmond Virginia
Where is he
Yes he did
He said that
He wants you to come and see him
I 'll be right over
Peerless your father called
I will And good luck with your show I hope it 's a huge success You 've worked very hard You deserve it
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy get a number or something
Peerless I did n't raise a buffoon We have enough of those on television already
To answer your question there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons
I guess he 's still on the road What kind of show is this Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons
I know what 's on my birth certificate You heard from Daddy
Son Peerless is your name Now you might be one of these Hollywood types change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate
Mommy please do n't call me that
If at first it 's not what you want just work that much harder Peerless
It was It is But this is a different kind of show
That 's wonderful Is n't that what you always wanted a show of your own
Ca n't beat it with a hammer Well since you asked it looks like I may have a new show a pilot being shot
How 's the food
I said no such thing All I said is that something must be wrong
C'mon Mommy do n't start with that I 'm an ungrateful son stuff
You hear me talkin to you The only time you come up here when something is wrong
It looks delicious
You must think I 'm some kind of fool
Thank you very much I always try my best
Good luck Jukka Do a good show
This is a travesty A debacle
Then will you teach me what I need to know Maybe we learn from each other if that 's possible no
This is a TV show not a music video
My visual style is very erotic sexy how do you say hot
How did you get this gig
Thank you for correcting my ignorance I 'm looking forward to working side by side with you I feel we make a good team
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN there were NEGROES I 'M A NEGRO
Ahhh I never heard of that term before I thought you were BLACK of African-American No
Did you just ask me what 's a Negro I 'M A NEGRO
A fiasco A disaster A boondoggle An abomination
What 's a Negro
Yes I know Jukka have you ever seen a Negro person before Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before
You know Finlandia vodka Yes
Finland
Helsinki which is the capital of Finland
Where are you from
I just turned twenty
Nice to meet you If you do n't mind me asking you how old are you
This show was created conceived by you a non-threatening African American male Voila End of argument It ca n't be racist because you 're black
Yes you
Thank you And always smile
Let Myrna finish
We all stick to this it 's smooth sailing
The Mantan Manifesto Catchy ai n't it Number One We gainfully employ African Americans in front of and behind the cameras Two Let the audience decide Three Who put these critics in charge These so-called cultural police Four Who determines what is black Five Mantan is a satire Six If they ca n't take a joke F 'em
The best defense is offense
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy
First I would like to say I love the show It 's very courageous My parents marched in Selma Alabama with Dr King
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings Through the roof But in this game you got ta be one two three steps ahead I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb She 's the best media consultant in the biz
I envy you That 's the way I want to feel about my work
I think that would probably make you the happiest When I 'm hoofing I mean really doing my thing hitting it nothing compares to that feeling in the world
Why do you say that You 've never seen me
You 're welcome You should n't give up on performing
If that was suppose to be a compliment I thank you
I 'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with You look beautiful like that
No we 're not knocking boots I got this internship while I still was at NYU DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant
Are you and him kicking it Knocking boots Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout
What do you mean
So what 's up with you and DeLa
A little I just graduated from NYU film school Cinema studies
You sing and dance
I wish I had your natural talent God only makes that visit once in a while
Not a class not a thing just picked stuff up by myself
You 've never had any formal training either
I never had a really real pair before
SMILEY I admit that 's a very hard thing to do Quickly let 's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors DA BOMB 125 PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR IT MAKES YOU WAN NA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER 125 AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS
I do n't know what a retort is but it 's simple Mantan The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL It 's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem This is America Our ancestors helped build this country we got a right just like everybody else I 'm not gon na box myself in This show makes people think and they 're laughing at the same time
SMILEY Do n't you feel that is a simplistic retort
No if you go with the flow Tavis That 's what a lot of Negroes do n't understand Protesting is n't gon na do a damn thing If people do n't like our satire in our number one hit show then do n't watch it Or better yet write your own show Do it better
SMILEY Is it inevitable that the game plays you
Money makes the world go round It ai n't no joke being poor I know whatI'mtalkin bout Y'knowwhatI'msayin I 've lived on the street I 've been homeless I 've learned how to play the game work the game be in the game
SMILEY Money and nothing else
Yo Tavis check it out This is the two-one the 21st century and it 's all about the money Like my man Mase says it 's all about the Benjamins
SMILEY Let 's jump right into it Your show has sparked a world of controversy provoked a tone of dialogue How do you see all of this
I 'm more comfortable around my people
SMILEY Before we begin I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview You could have chosen Mike Wallace Barbara Walters Jane Pauley whatnot but you 're here
Tavis thank you for having me
SMILEY Our guest tonight is the extraordinary talented performer Mantan Thanks for coming in

Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter My daddy visited us often fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father 's wife Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son which of course was my father 's brother in-law and my uncle for he was the brother of my step-mother My father 's wife also became the mother of a son He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter Accordingly my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother 's mother
N EAT Well I 'll be an Alabama porch monkey 's uncle
I do n't know who I am
N EAT How be dat
Dat 's yo Uncle Ben That reminds me I 've seen a lot of troubles lately
N EAT Ai n't Jemima on the pancake box

Forget about me are you a puppet for DeLa
So you say Sloan you wuz gon na use me up just like you used Dela Work it to the top I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like IHOP I 'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass
That 's ancient history That has nothing to do with you and I
Aw c'mon
We did it one time only once It had nothing to do with the job it was stupid Everything I 've got I 've earned
Did you ever sleep with DeLa
Say what Manray
Oh you gon na make me say it
Just ask me what you want to know
Stop playing me Sloan
And what
And
After my internship expired Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant
You leave something out
Worked my black ass off first as an intern then worked my way up to this position
How did you get this gig
You look beautiful like that
What
Y'know what
I 'll be down front You better start putting your face on
My people love me
You 're sure this is a good idea
For what He left Not me
Why do n't you call him
We can look out for ourselves
I just do n't want you and Cheeba to get hurt
Why all of a sudden are you flippin on me This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go Do n't even try to play it like you ai n't a part of all this You down with Delacroix
Bert Williams and the rest they had to black up They had no choice They were considered 3/5ths of a human being Did you know that 's written in the Constitution of the United States
Maybe I need to do a lot of things
Maybe you need to start
Never read a book in my whole life
You do n't read do you
No before my time
Y'know at the beginnin of the century African-American had to perform in blackface You ever heard of Bert Williams He was a great artist
Gots no intention of ending up broke
I hope you save a little somethin somethin
Just a little something somethin
Oh you do huh
Sloan I got it like 'dat
This is a nice place It must have cost a pretty penny
Are you trying to rap to me
What else
I 'm an asthmatic Been one all my life Ca n't go anywhere without an inhaler
The good stuff
What do you want to know
So what 's up with you
Enough
A lot
Well homeboy looks like he 's at a funeral
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways
Not at all sir I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again
GENTLEMAN Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel
That is none of your business
GENTLEMAN Where are you bound for
Good morning
GENTLEMAN Good day to you young sir
Do n't bully Mr Best Here are the pistols God bless you my boy and when I count three fire
BEST Ten sir and make them short ones do you hear Captain Grogan
There 's nothing else for it Take your ground Grogan twelve paces I suppose
You know the use of arms very well Best and no one can doubt your courage but Michael and I will see you home for all that
BEST I 'm not afraid of highwaymen My man is armed and so am I
Both of us ride home with Best here
If you 're insulted and not satisfied remember there 's two of us Best
BEST And I 'll tell you what Mr Dugan I 've been insulted grossly in this house I ai n't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on I 'm an Englishman I am and a man of property and I I
BEST I never was more in earnest
Pooh Pooh Best you are joking
BEST It 's not the English way for ladies to have two lovers and so Mr Dugan I 'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and I resign all claims to this young lady If she has a fancy for school-boys let her take 'em sir
Well well What is it We 'll make you used to our ways or adopt English ones
BEST I 'll tell you what it is Mr Dugan I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways I ai n't used to 'em sir
Hoity-toity John Best what 's the matter here
GALGENSTEIN Oh That will be sent after him I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say and at noon after parade shall be at the inn You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the Chevalier 's rooms until my arrival We must force that box You are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago
And his baggage
GALGENSTEIN You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
Not yet but I believe he intends to
GALGENSTEIN Has he sent the challenge yet
I am not sure The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
GALGENSTEIN What are the Chevalier 's intentions
GALGENSTEIN I had thought you more expert You must find out if the Chevalier cheats He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house Find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole If you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself we look at them there But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys
Only a very little as soldiers do
GALGENSTEIN You are a Hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins He gambles a great deal and wins Do you know the cards well
GALGENSTEIN There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast and wears the red riband and star of the pope 's order of the Spur He is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
What is the service sir
GALGENSTEIN Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police Herr Galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemen 's promotion
How do you do sir
GALGENSTEIN Good morning Private James Please come in I should like you to meet my uncle Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein
Neither
GALGENSTEIN It 's a lie You 're a deserter You 're an impostor sir Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you do n't know Will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up
Sir I 'm a British officer
GALGENSTEIN I have acted as I think fit
Upon my word sir I think you have acted very coolly
GALGENSTEIN It was my joke I was tired and did not care to go farther There 's not prettier woman here than that If she wo n't suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
Where 's the beauty you promised me
GALGENSTEIN The people are great farmers as well as inn-keepers
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard
GALGENSTEIN Ah You sly rogue I see that will influence you
GALGENSTEIN Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe
This may be a very good inn for Germany but it would not pass in old Ireland Corbach is only a league off let us push on for Corbach
GALGENSTEIN This is a very good inn Shall we stop for dinner
GALGENSTEIN Oh yes of course Ambassador O'Grady
O'Grady
GALGENSTEIN What is your uncle 's name
My companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about England which I answered as best I might But this best I am bound to say was bad enough I knew nothing about England and I invented a thousand stories which I told him described the king and the ministers to him said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him
GROGAN He has paid off your uncle 's mortgage He gave Dorothy a coach and-six That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle 's family Faith the business was well done Your cousins Michael and Harry never let him out of their sight though he was for deserting to England until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin Are you in want of cash my boy You may draw upon me for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and while they last you shall never want
The coward
GROGAN No the very same one my boy He recovered from his wound The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him It was only made of tow Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you But hit him you certainly did Roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to We told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
Mrs John Best Was there another Mr John Best
GROGAN She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband She is now Mrs John Best
Good heavens Whatever Has she died of grief
GROGAN There 's only six Miss Dugans now poor Dorothy
Is Miss Dugan well
GROGAN I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown
GROGAN We must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to Brown Bess
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office
GROGAN I had news of you in Dublin Faith you 've begun early like your father 's son but I think you could not do better than as you have done But why did you not write home to your poor mother She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which I wanted of my family
A man of honor dies but never apologizes I 'll see the captain hanged before I apologize
GROGAN Look here Roderick my boy this is silly business The girl will marry Best mark my words and as sure as she does you 'll forget her You are but a boy Best is willing to consider you as such Dublin 's a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service Make Best an apology and be off
GROGAN It must have been some other gate
Not against Castle Dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
GROGAN But swords are today impossible Captain Best is is lame He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
I 'll match any man with the sword
GROGAN Oh it 's with pistols we fight You are no match for Best with the sword
I hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully 's body
I am Harry James son and will act as becomes my name and quality
GROGAN And now you risk the same fate If you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
It was with this sword that my late father Harry James God rest his soul met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone the Hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck He was quite in the wrong having insulted Lady Fuddelstone when in liquor at the Brentford Assembly But like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
GROGAN That 's a very handsome sword you have there
GROGAN Your cousins go out with him
My mare is saddled and ready who 's the captain 's second
GROGAN The meeting is arranged Captain Best is waiting for you now
Have you taken my message to him
GROGAN In faith I believe you are not for a lad I never saw more game in my life Give me a kiss my dear boy You 're after my own soul As long as Jack Grogan lives you shall never want a friend or a second
He 'll give the better mark I am not afraid of him
GROGAN Well if it must be it must For a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw No officer bearing His Majesty 's commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it fight you must and Best is a huge strong fellow
Mark this come what will of it I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan I 'll follow him if it 's into the church and meet him there I 'll have his blood or he shall have mine Will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting
GROGAN And this is the return you make for his kindness Did n't he harbor you in his house when your father died and has n't he given you and your mother rent-free your fine house of Jamesville yonder
And so I am
GROGAN A pretty day 's work of it you have made Master Roderick Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so He takes a girl without a penny a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father
GROGAN Faith I think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word
Dorothy might love me or not as she likes but Best will have to fight me before he marries her
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me do you mind that
GROGAN This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
O'REILLY Tut tut I can play at fencing as well as you Mr Roderick James Ah You change color do you Your secret is known is it You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis I take you to my tradesmen who give you credit I accept your note for near two hundred pounds and what do I find A fraud
Repeat the words again and I run you through the body
O'REILLY You 're an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
Sirrah Sirrah I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland
O'REILLY Whom have I been harboring in my house Who are you sirrah
O'REILLY I have heard of them
Ah I see No I 'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown
O'REILLY Oh I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife 's dear father Colonel Granby Somerset
Which O'Higgins do you know For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family
O'REILLY Mr O'Higgins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin Mister O'Higgins I wonder if I know your good father
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship 's money and pearls
O'REILLY Mr O'Higgins I can not say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife
I have said all there is to be said I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish Good night
Your Grace if I am so tame as to take this then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation
Chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it If you will be patient maybe I will pay you something another time
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which I have honorably won
I do n't know
I deny your Grace 's accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
Chevalier though I can not say how I believe you have cheated me
OFFICER The gentleman has nothing contraband
I have no luggage
OFFICER As you please
All Europe shall hear of this
OFFICER Your honor must lower his voice
Ten thousand But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
OFFICER I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
It is shameful infamous I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador 's house
OFFICER You are going to drive to the frontier
Good gracious What is this
OFFICER I will let down the steps for your honor
Where is my rascal Lazlo
Perfectly certain because I shall make him tremble
Certain
I risk nothing for I am certain to kill him
To risk one 's life against such people is an imposition
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman
Sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask
Then ordering fresh horses the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier
Gentlemen I wish you a good day Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden
But how sir
Make your mind easy you shall not be left behind I warrant you Do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in Berlin The dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
But if they send you away then what is to become of me
I have faced that problem before
I believe they will deport you
Have no fear It will come out well for me
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
We will practice in the mornings my boy and I 'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing
I can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
The cards are now my only livelihood Sometimes I am in luck and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see It 's property look you and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me When the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste Do you understand the cards
I 'd give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood
Only the agency of servants
Who else can give me information about you
No one sir Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
For whom else have you worked
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach
Yes sir
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi
Yes sir Here is my letter
You are the young man who M de Seebach recommended
Take to your legs low Irish dog
That is a trifle strong
Very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
On the instant Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
Then you yield to me
Very well Now that I know it I will no longer love her
Perfectly so and what is more I will tell you that I love her and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals
Certainly monseigneur does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love
I entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady
Old fool
Lady Cosgrove you are an old fool
Roderick you know well enough that I have never loved but you Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy Ever so angry but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it No I loved you too much and too fondly I have always loved you From the first moment I saw you I saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but I could not help loving you I married you though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty What sacrifice do you want from me I am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me
My Lady Cosgrove 's relationship with me was a singular one Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me We would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes One day I was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth She suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out Oh my God Is it true I am not dreaming
As soon as I saw you loved me I was pleased and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part I would never love you But after our first kiss I found that I had no power over myself I did not know that one kiss could matter so much
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy
Without you my dearest I might have died without ever knowing love Inexpressible love God of nature Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes
O my dearest love Enough I beg you Stop believing in your experience You have never known love My very soul is leaving me Catch it on your lips and give me yours
Shall I tell you something I believed what was called love came after the union and I was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead And so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me I was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty
My husband has convinced me of the contrary
Let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew
Our abstinence makes our love immortal If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago now I should love you even more But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
I know better than you do Love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away
Always my dear one never any further Love is a child to be pacified with trifles A full diet can only kill it
Will we always leave it at this
I ask only a payment on account today after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
Poor man And for that reason you want to begin where people end
Yes but I am afraid of being deceived
You will do as you please It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other Do you not agree
Then I will respectfully take leave of her
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness
With a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me If I do not know it I am innocent
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
To love you until death To subscribe to all your commands
To make me wretched in two weeks
It is my only object
You want my heart
By loving you with no hope of possessing you
How so
I believe you and I see I must hasten to leave for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men
A man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
I agree but God put us on earth to take that risk
It is only too possible Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last
That is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
But if when I love I am unhappy I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
It is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
Your word empty makes me laugh Is it fortunate or unfortunate If it is fortunate I congratulate myself If it is unfortunate I do not care for I am not aware of it
Then you have never loved Your heart is empty
Many worthy of attention but valuing is something more I could value only someone whom I loved
What You have not met a man worthy of your attention
That man has perhaps not yet been born
Have you not a man whom you value
Not one
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
Not even that
But for a time a passing fancy
Never
Have you had one
No
Indeed Miss Dorothy I intend to have his blood as sure as my name 's Roderick
Monster Your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop But I 'll have my revenge I will Roddy will you see me insulted
Jump twenty feet You would n't dare to do any such thing on Daisy There 's the captain 's horse Black George I 've heard say that Captain Bes
Well then I 'll tell you what I 'd do I 'd jump Daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
What with me on the pillion Would you kill poor me
I 'd draw my sword and cut my way through them
Suppose now Roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier and is famous as a man of fashion in London It is mighty well of you to fight farmers boys but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter
If ever I meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two I 'll fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is
Oh I can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner Besides Roderick Captain Best 's a man and you are only a boy and you have n't a guinea in the world
But you refused me Dorothy
I do n't care a fig for Captain Best he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man He looks well in his regimentals too and if he chose to ask me to dance how could I refuse him
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best and then stroll out with him into the garden
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set
I hate Miss Clancy you know I do And I only danced with her because because the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night
With pleasure at finding the ribbon
Why are you shaking
Then you must get it
I feel the ribbon
Do you see the gate at the end of the field The first to touch it will be the winner
Agreed
I accept but I insist on a wager The loser must do whatever the winner pleases
All right five hundred guineas
Last month the Duke of Suffolk spent no more
It is entirely up to you I want the best
All the same you must name an amount
Yes for I wish to entertain splendidly
As much as possible
As much as possible
I am at your service Mr Cosgrove How much do you wish to spend
WEST Well Mr Cosgrove I 'll answer you point by point The King is exceedingly averse to make peers as you know Your claim as you call them have been laid before him and His Majesty 's gracious reply was that you were the most impudent man in his dominions and merited a halter rather than a coronet As for withdrawing your support from us you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please And now as I have a great deal of occupation perhaps you will do me the favor to retire or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you
Yes
WEST Have you done Mr Cosgrove
WEST Well sir this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty 's closet and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get
By name only
WEST Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus the thirteenth Earl of Crabs
And to be sure I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister Lord West whose acquaintance I made as I had so many others at the gaming table
What is to be done
GALGENSTEIN Then this must be done tomorrow
When is he to go
GALGENSTEIN The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country
The Prince left him only that choice
GALGENSTEIN A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible
GALGENSTEIN Hmm-mmmm
In so far as I can tell these things no I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly
GALGENSTEIN Was he cheated
Yes Minister I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein
GALGENSTEIN Does this assignment interest you
O'REILLY You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies In every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality To the lady 's question about my birth and parentage I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune that I was going to Dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
O'REILLY That 's very kind of you Mr O'Higgins
As you have been robbed of your purse may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home
O'Higgins Mohawk O'Higgins
O'REILLY But I should n't like to put you to such trouble Mister
I am riding to Dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap
O'REILLY That fool did n't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me
O'REILLY Everything my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuff-boxes watches And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
Be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong Have you lost much
O'REILLY Oh I am grateful to you sir I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin My chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck
What has happened madam to annoy your ladyship
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship 's assurances they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth in their presence at their counting-house in Birchin Lane London I requested they come here and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London but they declined saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate as they were aware of how other respectable parties such as Messrs Sharp and Salomon had been treated here
I see
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation They were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital
Yes of course
May I be quite frank with you
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill Are you serious
There are a few other points we should discuss The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill in giving her signature
I am prepared to accept the terms Mr Newcombe
Considering your financial circumstances Mr Cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity But obviously if you would reject this offer I shall keep trying to find a better one
Mr Newcombe I have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18 a year interest seems very stiff indeed
I have good news for you Mr Cosgrove The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick in the city of London are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds pledged against your interest in the Edric mines They will redeem the encumbrances against the property which amount to some 10,000 pounds and take a twenty year working lease on the mines They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income which they will apply to the loan as it comes in and they will make a charge of 18 per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance
Brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away
Yes he 's fine
Is he all right papa
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels
Yes papa
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan 's farm to see him
What the devil What kind of fools do we have here Pottle who told the lad this story
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you 've already bought my horse and that it 's at Doolan 's farm where Mick the groom is breaking it in Is that true papa
Yes
Papa
Good night my little darling
Good night papa
Well we 'll just have to wait and see wo n't we
But I will have it on my birthday wo n't I
Now just have a little patience my boy Your birthday is n't until next week
Did you buy the horse papa
WILLIAM I am sorry for you Mr James I 'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic What are the odds gentlemen that I do n't live to see Mr James hang yet
Sir let those laugh that win
WILLIAM Not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps Why man I have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation Who knows how long I may keep you waiting
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight
WILLIAM Is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as I am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor Is n't it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husband 's departure
Well if my intentions are what you think they are if I do wish to step into your shoes what then I have no other intentions than you had yourself Lady Cosgrove 's wealth may be great but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily Her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her and if I win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me
WILLIAM He wants to step into my shoes He wants to step into my shoes
Faith sir if I want to learn good principles it 's surely better I should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you
WILLIAM Gentlemen see this amiable youth He has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin Mr Hunt who has asked for advise from my wife Lady Cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple
I think Sir William Cosgrove you have had too much drink Your chaplin Mr Hunt has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter of which she is a considerable expert
WILLIAM Come come sir I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
I beg your pardon
WILLIAM Good evening Mr James have you done with my lady
Sir William Cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches He was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live I do n't know how many years If Cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady But my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account
WILLIAM Well why not a milkmaid 's daughter No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife 's sake on the contrary if he selects the animal properly he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure but a comfort in his hours of annoyance For instance I have got the gout who tends me A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power My wife never comes near me What friend have I None in the wide world Men of the world as you and I are do n't make friends and we are fools for our pains
The milkmaid 's daughter
WILLIAM In truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
Would you have me spend my life all alone
WILLIAM Indeed you are right sir Look at me Marriage has added forty years to my life I am dying a worn-out cripple at the age of fifty When I took off Lady Cosgrove there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself Fool that I was I had enough with my pensions perfect freedom the best society in Europe and I gave up all these and married and was miserable Take a warning from me Mr Roderick and stick to the trumps Do anything but marry
WILLIAM Hang it Mr Roderick James you have no more manners than a barber and I think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck and I like you sir because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own
I made Sir William Cosgrove 's acquaintance as usual at the play table One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth
Tender Hegenheim
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him
Will he wish to know the details of this night
He loves me as I love you
If his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
He is only curious to know who you are
And he does n't care about me
Yes He brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
Dark Valdez
Black-eyed Sczortarska
Charming Schuvaloff
Old friend Have n't talked to him in 911 Can I use your phone
Who
Bill Styles
Yeah and I could 've used the sleep I 'm supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going
Hurricane kept you up too
Do n't you mean do n't need no liquor license not taken away from me
You know the law no liquor before noon Could lose my license
Yeah if you 've slept
It 's ten thirty in the morning
Can I at least have a drink
You know that was like a quadruple negative
Do n't like 'em do n't eat 'em do n't make no damn difference to me
None of that matters now We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them You 're either with us or against us which is it
You framed-him
Maybe he 's dead too Maybe you killed them both Mueller
He is the only one unaccounted for
Maybe he 'll be there Either way we have to go
What about Pike
It was the grenade you fucking idiot Look at him
Did did you
Fine
I do n't want to go
Whoever it is is n't shooting at us
What do we do
Fuck what the fuck is going on
Just safety your shit and get behind me okay I 'll take care of this
I thought I was gon na have an attack Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou Childs could tell I was n't right
A target Kendall cap a fucking target What 's wrong with you
I 'm I 'm sorry
Do n't you ever point a gun at me
Shut up Mueller
West was one thing but this
HEY
Shut the fuck up you fucking faggot You just shut the FUCK UP
I do n't know
Before or after the explosion Mueller
We got I do n't know we got separated
We found him like this Kendall was with me the whole Listen to me
You killed him you fucking faggot
We found him like this
Hey I Holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
Can anybody hear me
This is n't our area Whose area is this
We can still come out of this okay Pike got free he got a gun he came after us That 's the story
You too
Shut up West 's dead
Yeah right
We found him like this
Holy fuck Holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
What do you mean alone
What about you wandering around alone At least we have an alibi
We do n't know West is dead
We finished the course and came here then heard an explosion Where 's Pike
He 's telling the truth up to a point
Washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
I promised them I 'd ask you where West and the others are
You wo n't find them Wo n't find West either He 's too good
And the bodies
I guess Nunez was n't dead after all He came after us with a vengeance You know the rest
Hunting we had to hunt him
Do what
He He made me do it
Jesus
Not true Cadet I 've got a gun
We 've found all of them
Oh you do n't What else do you have on me You have n't found any bodies yet have you
We do n't need the tapes
You wan na bet
We 're not finished yet
Mr Hardy I joined the army for college money I did n't ask for any of this I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed You say finding those bodies 'll help me then go find them I do n't want to die
Raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony Otherwise this is just another story
But not Pike 's
You saved Kendall 's life
They would have killed us both You want me to write a confession I 'll write a confession
You shot Childs and Nunez
Yeah
And he 'd been shot
Of course
You saw West 's body
I apologize
Yeah we know Pike did
I did n't shoot West
So Childs made some side money so what People are dead Ray and the only one we have to blame is you
Did Kendall tell you about the PX
Fuck you 're serious Raymond you got exactly zero truck with us right now we 'd take the word of a crackhead over yours so if you 've got something to say say it
I 'm serious
Well why did n't you say so We 'll just drop all your charges then
He 's lying
That 'd be my reaction too
That son of a bitch
Hey Ray Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall seems you killed three people
No actually I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some
This is one of those interrogation tricks is n't it You do n't give me a cigarette till I tell you more
You smoke Ray
Yeah And that 's all I 'm saying
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
Tell me about them
Some
Okay but I would like to know about the other cadets What they were like nice guys
I 'm not telling you what happened
Why 'd you ask for a cop Ray
Okay
Right Now I 'm gon na go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more okay
They 're dead are n't they
There 's no need
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West Piece of work that guy I remember he used to have these two silver 45 's with ivory handles and if you were n't quick enough he 'd knock you on the head with one of them He still carry those guns
You did Basic here
C'mon Ray everyone hates the Army during Basic I 'll tell you straight I hated it here
I do n't know I like the Army
What do you like then
I just do n't like it
Well it 's a game of anticipation that 's the beauty
It 's too slow
You 're under military arrest it 's not gon na happen What 's wrong with baseball
I asked for a policeman
Why not
Just a guess Maybe they 're not where they 're supposed to be Maybe somebody moved them Habeas Corpus no bodies no crime and Nunez still plays as self defense Face it detectives you have nothing
How do you know that
Ohhhh I do n't think so
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record No You assumed who I was because I was wearing this uniform Do n't believe me
We can prove that you 're not Ray Dunbar Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself
Is that what I did now And of course you can prove all of it
Ca n't do that now though can you
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too
Do n't know on a map West told us it was there we just found it Maybe the hurricane took it away
Where 's the cabin
Would you have believed me
Why did n't you tell us all this in the first place
Yeah
Mueller was alone in the cabin
Back up
One went off yeah but it did n't touch him I thought you knew this
What about the phosphorous grenade
The creek bed
Where
Pills shots you name it Basic 's a lot easier when you do n't feel pain
What business
No did he tell you about it About the business Childs ran
He said he worked there
Yeah Spent half his time in the infirmary Only reason he enlisted was his father West did n't section him till last week
Epilepsy
He was sickly Had that shaking thing whatd'yacall it epoxy
There were six of us
Tell us about the other guys the ones West weeded out
That first night with Pike I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
No ma'am he just wanted us to quit Making it through was kind of an honor Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight Command would consider you at the top of the class
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you
Your weapons Sergeant
What the fuck is going on
The rest of you fallout for physicals
Sir yes sir
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours He is not to be given food water or clothes If he so much as moves you are to blow his nigger brains out is that clear
Sir yes sir
You know how to work a pistol Dunbar
Sir Dunbar sir
Cadet what 's your name
I
So you killed him
So did we Why did n't you come
Pike and I got separated then I heard gunfire Close
West he 's dead
Jesus what happened
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one
Why
Shut up Let me see your grenades
I hated West Childs hated West everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that does n't mean we killed him
Oh bullshit he 's a fucking convict You know how much he hated West
He would n't kill anybody
Put it down
A test will no doubt link you to the killing
We wait and I 'm a dead man I got a black face a criminal record and over a hundred other cadets who 'll testify how much I hated West my court martial will take six minutes It 's either me or them Ray and you got ta decide right now
No no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P 's
There 's no time to think Ray we got ta get out of here You untie me we grab the guns get Kendall and Nunez and make a run for it
This is a lot of information to be getting I have to think
What do n't you know
I I do n't know
Mueller and Childs One of them must 've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper
They
Way I figure it West must have found out about their little business and was gon na bust them so they decided to get rid of him first
That 's close range You go full auto on a guy from close range you 're gon na be swimming in blood Look at my uniform Nothing
His chest was hamburger
From up close or far away
Full clip to the body
You saw West right How was he killed
That still does n't mean you did n't kill him
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ai n't exactly something you want to broadcast Only Mueller and Childs know
Why why did n't you tell me
Pull up my sleeve Right arm
You 're lying
Combat grade morphine Mueller sold it to me
Just look Little pocket
Why
Look in my pack
Bullshit
Enough to go to prison Childs PX scam Mueller was in on it
You hated West Mueller loved him
Who you gon na trust Ray Him or your friend
That 's exactly what he says about you
We 're sweeping our area and suddenly he 's gone Couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away
Oh come on
Mueller
If not you then who
Ray this is my life here I ai n't gon na pretend I 'm not happy West is gone but you know I could n't have done this It 's not in me
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper Were you watching your pack on the ride in
You 're the only one missing a grenade
Maybe but that do n't make me a killer
You hated West more than any of us
You got ta untie me I did n't do this thing Ray
Yeah
Right
Do I
You know it 's not like that
Why
We just want to check your pack
Roberto what the fuck
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place It 's gettin bad out there Where 's West
Where have you been Jay
I mean I killed him Is n't that what we all wanted
What do you mean West 's
West 's Any kindling for afire
Whose blood is that Jay
Maybe he
MAYBE WHAT
Maybe
Where are they
I do n't know
You lied to us Levi you 're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
But you ca n't prove it You ca n't prove anything until we find the bodies
I did n't
Or you Levi When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
Because I was standing next to him
How do you know
Because of what I saw Who really killed West
Why
I did n't do anything
Jail if he 's lucky the gas chamber if he 's not
I was just thinking of what 's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
Something funny Levi
Then we 'll leave it up to the courts His word against mine What does his father do again Steelworker Does n't matter I 'm sure justice will be served In any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son He 's quite protective
Dunbar will testify that you were
Sorry to disappoint I 'm on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind You 're right it was Nunez Any more questions
Well
I believe your next line is What are you trying to hide
Huh You know I really thought you said Nunez I thought you said Dunbar was gone My fault I got ta check the tape on that Oh yeah we taped the last interview This one too Cause it 'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie
No I said Dunbar
Dunbar was running out the door Ohhhhhh See that 's where I was confused because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds The guns went off I ran in Childs shot me Pike and Mueller were dead and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun
Why did you tell us he shot everybody Levi You put him in for three murders the man saved your life
There 's that word again As I told you I was n't in the room when everyone started shooting
Is it the truth
My heart weeps
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who 's been shot
How many murders did you cover up One Five Maybe an even ten
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar
Stop
Somebody emptied a full clip into him
Mr Hardy
Okay I think that 's it He rises and walks to the door
I honestly do n't know Maybe to have someone to cover for him And I wish I could but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men
Why did he come back for you
Right in front of us Mueller went after him but we held him back
He admitted it
No Poetic justice though
But you did n't
Maybe I should n't tell you that Maybe I should tell you I was n't scared at all But I was Enough to almost kill him
Then who did
I did n't kill him
What happened to degrees
You said you wanted to know what happened I 'm telling you the truth
Levi I do n't know if you 're familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled My father interceded so instead West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay
I think you just blew Do n't Ask Do n't Tell out of the fucking water
He is not shall we say wild about the idea He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and I have done my best to oblige him However in the last four weeks I began a relationship with another cadet What do you think of that
Senator Daddy must be thrilled
My father is a powerful man Over the years he 's used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain unpleasantries I am a homosexual
My my my how did things turn so hostile so quickly If I did n't know better I 'd say you two were out to get me
But not the only victim right
I 've done nothing wrong I 'm the victim here
Levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to Washington and lock you in a very small dark room I suggest you talk to us
That 's it You 're that policeman with friends in low places Tell me how 's Guissepe Torres doing these days Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer
Coast Guard special detective detail We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk
You I 've seen you around the Base But you You 're not Army are you
Get your hands away from the desk
For the last time I have no idea what you 're talking about
You ca n't duck this Bill I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I wo n't let this happen
You 're crazy
No more witnesses West 's a ghost But it does n't matter because we have your signature the hospital log and Kendall 's toxicology report And that 'll be enough
Not for long
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character The army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct There 's only one criminal standing in this room and it 's you
No You will stand there and you will listen What happened to you Bill You were the one who joined up to do good in the world You were the one who believed in it
I 'm not even going to dignify that
You poisoned him Bill You heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like Pike
I wanted to see if he was okay
Toxicology report came back Kendall 's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe you 've heard of it It 's for asthmatics If an epileptic takes enough it kills them I checked with the nurses at the hospital you 're the only other person who visited Kendall
That 's preposterous
What I ca n't understand is why you signed these If you 'd just let West take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too
West had a partner Someone who knew how to get things done
Or what You 've gone round the bend
Stay where you are
I 'm not going to cover for you Bill Not for this
You 're drunk
If you let him testify then it would have all come out West was supposed to take care of it out there shut Nunez up and then disappear But it got messy and people got killed So you called your old pal Tom Hardy figuring if worse came to worse he 'd cover for you
What are you talking about
It was so good I actually forgot you 're one of the bigger dogs now The Base Commander The one in control You could n't let him testify could you
I thought you said that was n't a compliment
You 're a good soldier Bill
Do n't be I 'm not cut out to deal with the West 's of the world
I 'm sorry Bill
The Senator
They 're taking your command are n't they
I would n't know where to start I guess it was about one man framing another He thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings
You think you could explain all this to me
Maybe But it 's my fault and I 'll carry it
That 's horseshit and you know it
It 's over Time of death was 4:42 JAG 's been notified and I called the Senator myself My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable you two had no culpability in the matter
Does Osborne agree
Yeah
Was dead right You think Dunbar 's on the level
What I said before
I 'm talking about West We had him Bill we were there You 're the fucking Base Commander you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has
What the hell are you talking about
You want a confession Why do n't you confess Bill people are dead and you do n't give a shit about it Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault
What about the confession
Home I 'm done
Tom where are you going
JAG gets here in three hours Try for the confession
You mean not enough to save you
Not for me
Nevertheless what Kendall will testify and that 'll be enough
Nevertheless
From Dunbar I hate to break this to you but I do n't think he 's gon na be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
Without the body we have no physical proof We need a confession
Okay then let 's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car
Habeas Corpus you have to have a body to have a crime
There was a hurricane Bill the wind probably moved it
We 've already been over the terrain twice Nothing
Someone must have got a shot off He was n't exactly a moving target
Who killed Pike
Pike killed West Dunbar killed Mueller Childs and Nunez
He can wait Kendall 's out of surgery
He 's not done by a longshot I can get more out of him
I 'm not gon na let that happen
Tom bottom line I let those kids go out there If JAG shows up and I do n't have any answers for them my career is finished
And I 'm the closest thing to it right
The guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop
Which gives us about five hours Why 'd you call me
Cadet Roberto R Nunez Killed right in front of me
I 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one
No the problem is one 's dead one 's got a bullet in his arm and one wo n't talk The one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up
And the problem is you only got three
The exercise was one of his Section Eight private sessions Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning
Well he 's a good soldier
A few years ago the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder gentler military He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country
It 's not West is it Tell me it 's not West
The official term for it is Clusterfuck By the time Beth hit us I 'd canceled all off base exercises save one a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush We 're missing three and the Sergeant The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names But the Sergeant
And here you are going out of house How 's that make you feel Jules
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
Tell me what I can do
Would I have called you if it was n't If there was any other way
That bad
What kind of trouble are you in
Been better I read about what 's been happening with you I should have called
How are you
Yeah But he was a lot of other things too Thanks
He was your friend
In case you need me to testify about the shooting They 'll clear you
Your phone number
Yeah
I should probably write that down
A word of advice about women that first hour or so after they kill their boss Probably not the best time to hit on them
Want company
Nah
Think it 'll work
Go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
Leaving without saying goodbye What are you gon na do
What are you doing out here
Yeah I can wait till you 're off the base and do it myself
Do I have a choice in this
Nobody saw But I do n't think so
West
Far as I 'm concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past
Really
You 're a good man Hardy
There are degrees of truth officer Always degrees
That 's not true
Tough
What if I do n't want it
This is the perfect time You know what makes a good detective The number of confessions they get You 're a good detective Osborne So now you get mine
This is n't the time
Seven guys What was it you said You were just starting to believe I was n't the guy people said
What
Seven
We need to talk
No death certificates No crime
No bodies no West
WHERE 'S WEST 'S BODY
Hardy for Chrissakes
We can tie you to the chair if it 'll work better for you
Is n't this how your story goes
Hardy what are you doing
Right back where we started
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down
Get in
Four
Good just making sure
No
Maybe Maybe we were nowhere near Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries I have n't by any chance grown on you have I
We were close to something with Kendall
That 's gon na stay my secret
For what
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority and all I did here was follow orders It did n't add up Plus I got kicked out
You know you never told me why you left the army
Nah
Think it 'll work
Now I go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
So what now
So did I
Yeah
You wanted to break him
You mean the falsely accused
No I did n't I wanted to humiliate him For what he did to Dunbar For fucking over the little guy
You wanted to get the truth
Yeah I could 've Should 've
You could n't have known
I pushed him too hard
See I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall 's gay son went nuts on a training mission
That 's a fantastic idea
Good idea
Why do n't you talk to Levi off the record for a second
Positive Hardy they planned this
Are you sure
What Kendall said the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around That 's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter
What
They got their stories straight
We 're fucked I know
Let 's go talk to Bill
Little bit
That bugs you too
So why after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house does the Senator 's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber
And all hell breaks loose A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz bang zoom happy ending
Buttfucks the cabin
Kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin
So it 's a good plan but it goes wrong Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story
And if they 're asked that 's what they 'll tell the world
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
Exactly someone who 's not involved who 's word ca n't be questioned You only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes they 've totally bought into your version of events
Dunbar
And they 're smart about it They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness
Talk it through Childs Mueller and Nunez know they 're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it Kill West pin it on Pike
What happened next
At least you and Kendall agree on that
Dunbar He said he did n't shoot West West was n't shot Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body
What
I did n't shoot West
Because it 's my job Because people are dead Because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that We can do this Hardy
Why do you care
But you will
Oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit This is n't my great second chance Osborne Everyone thinks I 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that Nobody will ever know what happens here
I was starting to believe you you know That you were n't who everyone said I guess I was wrong
Phenomenal at taking bribes right
You did more than try You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator you 're phenomenal
West was a monster Fifteen years ago I was here I was Section Eight I was Pike Fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did stripping Pike down making him stand outside all night He did that every year he did that to me Fifteen years ago I wanted him dead and now I 'm supposed to care that somebody offed him Sorry no can do I tried
You said you owed Styles and now you 're gon na turn your back on him
Watch me
Goddammit Hardy you ca n't just leave
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what He deserved it There 's your confession
Styles could n't reassign him he 's a legend
I do n't know
Why the fuck was n't he in restraints
Well I 'm sure if he 'd known this was all going to happen he 'd have tried harder to witness it for you
Look all we 've got is what Kendall says and he did n't actually witness any deaths except Nunez He found West he saw Mueller and Pike but just their bodies he did n't see any crime committed
Everyone 's capable of murder Osborne
I just He came back for Kendall I do n't think he 's capable of murder
That means under a year Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic There are no conspiracies no grand mysteries and no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it does n't always make sense but it 's always neat Dunbar 's our guy
I do n't think that has anything to do with
Too neat How long have you been an investigator
I lied Wait for it
But we have to question him Thought you did n't have cigarettes
Have no fear Osborne we have not yet begun to fight
That was kid gloves
Got it
Remember he 's the son of a Senator so go easy Kid gloves
Not the happiest of memories
Being back here Gives me the willies
Something wrong
What point
He 's telling the truth up to a point
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there What do you think of Dunbar
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
So noted
You 're off to a late start
I plan to grow on you
You do understand that there 's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you right
The very same
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about is n't it
Yeah That 's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed Truth is I do n't know The whole honor and duty thing Make a difference in the world crap like that Did n't really work out
You 're kidding
I lost a bet
Something like that You
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
Typical army brat story Dad was noncom Mom was a Nurse There was never any real doubt of joining up
Microrecorder for Kendall did n't have time to wire his room Now tell me why you joined the army or I 'll jab this pen through your neck
What is that
Best time for banal chit-chat
We 're in the middle of a murder case
You 're right We should sit in silence
You really want to make banal chit chat like that now
Oh I 'm sorry I did n't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good Everyone knows good cop bad cop by admitting it I appeared trustworthy
You made me look like an idiot
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars
Baseball
See Ray this is what we call good cop bad cop She shouts I stand up for you you 're grateful a bond of trust is established
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez you 're a murderer
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes
I questioned him for three hours and he did n't make a sound You do n't have a badge he wo n't talk to you
Something like that
Good cop/bad cop
Thank you At some point in there I 'm gon na rub my nose When I do go at him with everything you got
Is he handsome self assured carry himself well does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor does he have good bones suggesting good breeding does he slouch or sit up straight these are important questions as they reveal a great deal about this man 's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute
That is the most unprofessional
Is Dunbar cute
Excuse me
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which does n't exactly put people at ease Is he cute
Why
Move him
Yes
He 's in interrogation
Kendall Junior is still in surgery so he wo n't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour the cadet we 're talking to first is Dunbar
Christ Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone
Senator Jonathan Kendall of Ohio
Levi Who names their kid Levi
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe so all we have are their dogtags Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall
Three things First You do n't have a choice Second I 've never taken a bribe in my life And Third I 'm still a little drunk from last night so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you try not to take offense Tell me about the two guys
Subtlety really is n't one of you finer points is it Osborne
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside I 'm not comfortable having you involved in this
It was for suspicion of bribery it 's really all in the wording
You 're the Tom Hardy I 've been reading about in the papers right New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff I owe him
You and the Colonel go back
Got ta be honest I love what you 've done with the place
And you notice I 'm not in the Army anymore
Sergeant West 's served for twenty three years He 's the public face of the modern Army
I did n't mean that as a compliment
He was our Drill here Man 's older than sand
You knew Sergeant West
Ah Christ
Fantastic You want to tell me what 's going on
Hostile and uncooperative
Although that wo n't matter much when coupled with the murder charge
Pike please
Someone else can do the deed it does n't have to be you Maybe Nunez too he 's got a tendency to follow Mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their Sergeant 's killers We 'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West all we got ta do is tell the story right
I do n't think I want to hear this
Mueller He 's as bad as West and we both know it Now I ca n't do it cause I 'm tied up but we get the others to go along
How
A gay Senator 's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise The press 'll crucify you and your father His career will be over and it 'll be your fault But we do this different and you come out a hero
What are you talking about
The thing is we 've got a real opportunity here You turn me in tomorrow and we 're both fucked
To start a fire goddammit What about him huh Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts brought an extra one in his pack Y'ever think of that Go ahead cut him loose First chance he gets he 'll waste the rest of us that 's how they work
So you took off your shirt
I was freezing from the hurricane
I 'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly
Oh you remember now
I remember now it was before the explosion
Yeah and he does n't know when
Pike and I got separated
You better watch it faggot I 'm not sure you and Childs did n't do him
Poor fucker my ass
They found him Poor fucker was practically blown in half
Oh yeah Excuse me Sergeant sir we do n't feel like going out we do n't want to get rained on He 'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland
We should tell him we 're not going
You ever been in a hurricane Mueller
You ever been in a hurricane Mueller
The faggot speaks
Maybe we should n't go
He came after us And I told Dunbar he had to kill him
What happened with Nunez
So you framed him The same way Childs was going to frame Pike
I scared Dunbar into silence He 's been trying to cover for me the whole time We got here you came to see me I did n't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret
I told him what had really happened to West Told him to keep quiet about it or I 'd destroy him Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam my father would be finished
Childs
Who Levi
We did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone It was because I threatened him
Wrong answer
Dunbar 's telling the truth
What
Wait
Enjoy your flight to Washington
It will and you know why Because you 're not a person anymore you 're a cadet in the United States Army you have no identity no Miranda warning and no rights So I 'm gon na throw you to the wolves and unlike you I 'm gon na get away with it because you 're pissing me off
It wo n't work
What
It does n't matter Levi We 're going to find those bodies and when we do I 'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon
You ca n't threaten me
You and Dunbar got your stories straight Little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you You think you 're just going to slide out of this You 're an accessory to murder Levi you 're going to jail
Then he 's mistaken You know I really do n't think my father would approve of this line of questioning
Dunbar says you were
No but it got you interested did n't it Got you to dig Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they did n't belong
Pike never confessed
Not much time to solve the crime Tell me detective how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it
Fifty minutes
Running out of time are we Tick tock tick-tock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
We 've been making progress I see
Pike never confessed
Like I said I was in the kitchen When I came out Mueller and Pike were dead Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone
But you did n't see it right
Because he 'd shot Mueller
Nunez was chasing Dunbar
He whispered it in my ear
No one else heard it
You 're gon na die tonight faggot Clear as day
He said what
He wanted more than that
He could n't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
What The Truth Please There are degrees of truth officer always degrees Things are not what they seem
We just want
failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself
Tell him to shut up
Shut up
Until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West 's body
Bullshit
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard
The fuck are you talking about
Cadet Michael Mueller I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West
We 're not going anywhere
Goddammit Ray we got ta get out of here
Still got mine on not a speck of blood on it Not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours
I used it to start the fire
Where 's your shirt Mueller
We all know what you did Pike I do n't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here but
Shut the fuck up He was gon na cut him loose
This place is going Mueller We got ta move
What the fuck are you doing
Thank God
Blame the nigger then huh Someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first
What the fuck happened to you One minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas
What the fuck happened to you
Toughens us up Pike You do n't like it quit
Hurricane 's due after midnight and we 're still going out
Ma'am Ray Dunbar 's black
So
You mean Ray Dunbar Well that ai n't right
No no that was Cadet Dunbar
Funny I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
Terrible tragedy One of those Section Eight boys worked in here Pike Heard he got out okay
Yeah
Sign here and here Hey ai n't you the folks workin on that whole hulabaloo from last night
The army kicked you out for drugs
You never told me why you got kicked out of
Gets on his plane in ten minutes which means you two are done You 'll understand if I do n't walk you out
What happens to Dunbar now
I 'm giving you a chance to walk away
We know
You both know if you do this if you go after a Senator 's son and you 're wrong it 's not just me in the hot seat anymore
He tried to burn Dunbar to us You do n't do that if you 're not involved
You want Kendall do n't you
It 's too neat
What do you think
No
You think he did it
I called the JAG Corps the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C on a transport leaving here at 1700
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup If they 're hurt and we can get to them in time
Then it 's unofficial
He 's not Army it 's not official
He 's former Army and the best I 've ever seen in a room Besides he knows the territory we did Basic together here You 've had three hours with Dunbar and have n't gotten a peep we need to take a different tack
But this guy you called he 's not even Army
He asked to see a policeman we 're getting him a policeman
This is totally unnecessary
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find Each area has twenty targets first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins Teams are as follows Dunbar and Nunez Pike and Mueller Kendall and Childs
CADETS Sir yes sir
Some of you may have heard there 's a hurricane coming American soldiers do not wait for good weather they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh feel free to lay down and die you get me
So forget what you 've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder gentler military you will either succeed quit or die by my hand
CADETS Sir yes sir
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone as it would weaken the fabric of this nation 's defense This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me understand give me a sir yes sir
CADETS Sir yes sir
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit and those who refuse to quit I will kill You ever hear of a training accident give me a sir yes sir
CADETS Sir yes sir
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives You have chosen to join my Army This Army is my mother my father and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze do you understand me give me a sir yes sir

BENNETT Your mother came in about three in the afternoon Her neighbor drove her on account of your father was on business in Wichita You were born a week early but there were no complications It was a perfect delivery Now your father was sorry to miss it but it was n't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then so I ca n't see as it would have been much different had he been there And that 's the real story of how you were born
No
BENNETT Not that one The real story Did he ever tell you that
A thousand times He caught an uncatchable fish
BENNETT Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born
BENNETT Five-eleven One-eighty Regulated hypertension How would his son describe him
How would you describe him
BENNETT Thirty years Maybe more
How long have you known my father
My father and I have an advantage We never talk
BENNETT Glad to see you 're not trying to have a heartfelt talk It 's one of my greatest annoyances when people talk to those who ca n't hear them
BENNETT Absolutely Be good for you to talk to him
Can I see him
BENNETT A pleasure
Dr Bennett It 's good to see you My wife Josephine
BENNETT Will
I 'm sorry Jenny I am
Lucky girl
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die she 's the only one
I know
Do n't Do n't be embarrassed I should never have let you think that I am in love with my wife
Go
I 'll
Please Go Just go
Lord I 'm sorry I
I can get it I can just
It 's okay just leave it
I see I thank you for your time
I wo n't be selling you this house Mr Bloom
I was 18 He was 28 Turns out that was a big difference
You 're Beamen 's daughter Your last name is different You married
I 'm sorry Have I offended you
I 'm not convinced you should be happy
Helping people makes me happy
It 's not like you 're going to lose anything You can ask anyone in town I 've been nothing if not generous I want the best for everyone
Then I do n't think so Mr Bloom If nothing is going to change I 'd just as soon it not change in the way it has n't been changing all this time
In so many words yes
I 'll offer you more than it 's worth And you know you wo n't have to move Nothing will change except the name on the deed you have my word
So I 've heard
Apparently I 've overlooked this one piece of it and I 'd like to remedy that You see in order for the town to be preserved the trust must own it in its entirety
No one would come out here unless they had business And no one would have business with me except for you You 're buying the town
How did you know
You must be Edward Bloom
I promise Someday When I 'm really supposed to
Promise me you 'll come back
I suspect it will hurt a lot
How are you gon na make it without your shoes
And when I 'm 38 you 'll be 48 And that 's not much difference at all
You 're pretty good at arithmetic
I 'm eight That means when I 'm eighteen you 'll be 28 And when I 'm 28 you 'll only be 38
Eighteen
How old are you
It 's not a woman it 's a fish No one ever catches her
Yeah
Was she nekkid
Well she uh
What did she look like
Did you see that woman
And I like you
I like your stories
I did n't forget I was just working on a tangent See most men they 'll tell a story straight through and it wo n't be complicated but it wo n't be interesting either
You were talking about your wedding
There was one time when I was eleven
Truth is I 've been thirsty my whole life Never really known why
Is it the medicine that 's making you thirsty
Well we were all set to but there was a complication
I thought you said you did n't have a church wedding
Well it 's not a short one
Oh so this is a tall tale
Will never told you that Probably just as well He would have told it all wrong anyway All the facts and none of the flavor
I never knew
That 's because we did n't have a wedding Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me She was engaged to somebody else
Please
You do n't need a picture Just look up handsome in the dictionary
Can I take your picture
Spooning the sherbet
They were squeezing the cheese Clanking the bottles Licking the popsicle
Stop
He was buttering her rolls Pumping her churn Splashing milk in her box
He was slipping her a little extra cream
No I understand
Because see my mother was banging the milkman
Terrible for her but think about me young boy with that kind of power Was n't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said Your Grampa is going to die Well I ran right back to my parents My father said no Gramps is fine but I could see there was trepidation And true enough that next morning my Grampa was dead
That 's terrible
Means when you dream about something that 's going to happen Like one night I had a dream where this crow came and told me Your Aunt is going to die I was so scared I woke up my parents They told me it was just a dream to go back to bed But the next morning my Aunt Stacy was dead
What were you dreaming about
I was dreaming
Hi How are you feeling
You 're lucky to get four words out of them in English But if you were to walk through the jungle you 'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French Those parrots talk about everything politics movies fashion everything but religion
Really
Just to be sure you can take my pack
You 're not trying to run away
That poet Norther Winslow did He was going to Paris France He must have liked it because no one ever heard from him again Tell you what You take the other way and I 'll cut through here Meet you on the far side
You know anyone 's who 's taken it
Beats me
What did she say
Okay
Okay
I love every square inch of it But I can feel the edges closing in on me A man 's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this So what do you say Join me
You do n't like it
Mine 's Edward And truthfully I do want you to leave Karl But I want to leave with you You think this town is too small for you well it 's too small for a man of my ambition I ca n't see staying here a day longer
Karl
What 's your name Giant
You 're just trying to get me to leave are n't you That 's why they sent you here
So why are you wasting your time in a small town You 're a big man You should be in the big city
I can
Would n't lie to you And they 've got all-you-can-eat buffets You can eat a lot ca n't you
Really
Hardly two stories in the whole place Now I 've heard in real cities they 've got buildings so tall you ca n't even see the tops of 'em
Yes Exactly
You become what you always were A very big fish And that 's the way it happens
Story of my life
It 's unbelievable
The River
You say
Where are we headed
Somehow you 're better Different You 're getting ready to go And I say
Let 's get out of here
Okay Okay
Like this
I can try Dad If you help Just tell me how it starts
How I go
How what happens
Tell me how it happens
The river
The river
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born And if you ca n't see that it 's your failing not mine
Yourself Good bad everything Just show me who you are for once
What do you want Will Who do you want me to be
It would kill you huh
Dad I 'm about to have a kid of my own here It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me
Only on the surface But that 's all I 've ever seen
You think I 'm fake
You tell lies Dad You tell amusing lies Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime They 're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty And the thing is I believed you I believed your stories so much longer than I should have And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible everything I felt like such a fool to have trusted you You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined Just as charming and just as fake
I 've told you a thousand facts That 's all I do Will I tell stories
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
What you 're seeing down to my nose My chin
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them The other 90 percent is below the water where you ca n't see it And that 's what it is with you Dad I 'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water
Then you should n't have started with a question Because people want to answer questions You should have started with The thing about icebergs is
I 'm trying to make a metaphor here
What
Dad
Do I I saw an iceberg once They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water only they did n't count on an elephant being frozen inside The woolly kind A mammoth
Do you know much about icebergs Dad
Can we talk
Son
Dad
But the real story is how I got the car You see
I think someone has n't
The maple tree and the Buick We heard it
Yes
Did I ever tell you about how
Oh so you know
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year
It 's rude to talk about religion You never know who you 're going to offend
Why not religion Dad
I said this is n't how I go The last part is much more unusual Trust me on that
I thought you were n't dying
I used to do it when you were gone remember I used to do it a lot
You know where the chemicals are
I will
Your mother has n't been keeping up the pool If you wanted to you could
I 'd just like to know the true versions of things Events Stories You
You mean while I 'm here
Dad I 'm hoping we can talk about some things while I 'm here
You 're right
There 's a lot you do n't know about me
When did you ever work in an office
True story
Really
You owe me three-fifty
What did he say
And every day I gave him a quarter Every day Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks And when I went back there you know what he said
Okay
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office
Surprise ending Would n't want to ruin it for you
So how does it happen
I saw my death in that eye And this is not how it happens
No she was old and probably senile Maybe schizophrenic
She was a witch
The Old Lady by the swamp
Truly I saw it in The Eye
Really
People need n't worry so much It 's not my time yet This is n't how I go
You learned from the best
You think I 'm up for it
No but I hear it 's terrible Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine
Did you do any of that
Having a kid changes everything I mean there 's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
Am I
You are in for a surprise
I 'm not scared
Your mom says I ca n't tell you that one anymore You get nightmares
The one about the witch
No Dad they do n't I do not like the story Not anymore not after a thousand times I know all the punchlines Dad I can tell them as well as you can For one night one night in your entire life the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom It revolves around me and my wife How can you not understand that
Come on Will Everyone likes that story
Friend of yours Did you help him out of a bind
Jesus Christ
I am a footnote in that story I am the context for your great adventure Which never happened Incidentally You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born
What a father 's not allowed to talk about his son
Make him stop
You can see my predicament My wedding ring the symbol of fidelity to my wife soon to be the mother of my child was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish
I see We need to get you one of those plant misters We can spray you like a fern
I was drying out
Go out with me
How can I convince you to stop
I have the rest of my life to find out
You do n't even know me
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me
How did you get so many
They 're your favorite flower
Daffodils
But you 're wrong I do know you at least by reputation Edward Bloom from Ashton See I 'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton Don Price He was a few years older than you
Oh
Do n't need to apologize to me I mean I 'm the luckiest person you 're going to find today
I 'm sorry
WINSLOW Edward it 's got your deposit slip on it
'Fraid so
WINSLOW This is it The whole vault
WINSLOW I 'm robbing this place
So what are you up to now
That 's great Norther I 'm happy for you I ca n't believe I helped
WINSLOW I want you to know when you left Spectre it opened my eyes There was a whole life out there that I was not living So I travelled I saw France and Africa half of South America Every day a new adventure that 's my motto
I do n't believe it
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas
WINSLOW It 's me Norther Winslow
You 're a poet You oughta be able to And maybe if you 'd seen more you could
WINSLOW I ca n't imagine any place better than here
Norther do you ever regret not making it to Paris
WINSLOW This is why you do n't show work in progress
WINSLOW There 's a lot of expectation I do n't want to disappoint my fans
Really
WINSLOW I 've been working on this poem for 12 years
WINSLOW There is no softer ground than town
Wait I need those
Well therapy And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back I was living in a fairy tale
You did n't become crazy
No it 's logical if you think like your father See to him there 's only two women your mother and everyone else
Logically you could n't be the Witch because she was old back when he was young
My father talked about a lot of things he never did and I 'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about I 'm just trying to reconcile the two
Look I do n't know how much you want to know about any of this You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it Especially this late in the game
Because he 's dying
Can I ask you a question Why did you come here today If you found this deed why did n't you just ask Eddie
I 've seen him with women He flirts He always has On some level I presumed he was cheating on my mother I just never had proof
Wow Wow you just said it I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour
Were you and my father having an affair
This was on his sales route so he was through here all the time Everyone in town knew him
How did you know my father
I am And you 're Will I 've seen your picture that 's how I recognize you I almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward Like this
Are you Jenny Hill
I was n't expecting you
Hello
Oh Oh
I loved it It sounds peculiar but I loved every minute of it I did Eddie was travelling a lot so he was gone but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me A little part of his soul inside me I could feel it It was alive and kicking
I do
Do you like it being pregnant
I know It was the same when I was carrying Will Like clockwork
I 'm sorry It seems every hour I have to
I need to lie down for a bit
I 'm going to check on him
I 'll help you
I 'm going to get started on dishes
We 'll have to pick up a copy
I spent a week in Morocco for the story It was incredible
Down the hall on the right The door sticks You have to really pull it
Yes
Thank you I 'll bet you need to
Is he going to be okay
Your father had a stroke He 's upstairs with your mom and Dr Bennett
What happened
I am always on your side And I think you should talk to him
I need you on my side
You 're not
Look I know why you like him I know why everyone likes him But I need you to tell me I 'm not crazy
What is true I 've never heard my father say a single true thing
But it 's not true
You have to understand When I was growing up he was gone more than he was here And I started thinking maybe he has a second life somewhere else With another house another family He leaves us he goes to them Or maybe there is no family Maybe he never wanted a family But whatever it is maybe he likes that second life better And the reason he tells all those stories is because he ca n't stand this boring place
Do you love him
Everyone loves my father He 's a very likeable guy
Do you love your father
Mmm what I know better than to argue romance with a French woman
Mmm what
Mmm
But it 's romantic
That 's because most of it never happened
What about the details How they fell in love The Circus The War You never told me any of that
They met at Auburn
You never told me how your parents met
Did you
I talked with your father last night
I 'm going with you
You do n't have to
I 'm going with you
Probably tonight
You need to go
It 's more than they thought They 're going to stop chemo
It 's bad
Yes Thank you
Mom do you want some time with Dad
That 's okay
I 'll stay Why do n't you go home with Josephine and I 'll stay tonight
I do n't suppose one of us could stay with him In case he In case he wakes up one of us should be there
Heavens no We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place
So you never bought any land
I suppose your grandmother 's house when she passed on But we sold that right away Your cousin Shirley bought it
Did you and Dad have any other property
Yes
Mom
He just fell asleep Josephine 's with him
Is he awake
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
That really happened
Do you know who that is
No But it 's weird She seemed to recognize me
Was she one of your teachers
Mom do you know who that is Blonde hair
Before I forget your father has papers in the basement I 'd like you to go through I would n't know what 's important
Well clearly you do n't But I 'm not the mystery you 're trying to solve right now
But I understand you Mom I always have
I know it 's not easy Just remember he did n't choose to be your father and you did n't choose to be his son You just ended up together You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it 'd be just the same If you ask me it 's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all
True But I 've known him my whole life and I do n't feel like I know him at all Or ever will
Yes you both think William Bloom is a very smart man The problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someone 's wife And I 've been his wife longer than I 've been your mother You ca n't discount that
Josephine and I have a lot in common
No it 's not It 's exactly the same Your father and I met we dated and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level Just the same as you two
Yes But that 's a different
Would you say you understand Josephine
Yes Will I do And do n't presume things you do n't know
How is that possible I mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly it 's another one of his stories You ca n't honestly say you know him
Yes
What I mean is do you really know what 's going on in his head
Of course
Mom would you say you understand Dad
Really That 's wonderful
I do n't know if you 've seen it but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek
You do n't talk about those things Not yet
How much time does he have left
He 's impossible He wo n't eat And because he wo n't eat he gets weaker And because he 's weaker he does n't want to eat
How is he
He 's up with your father
Is that Dr Bennett 's car
You did n't need to do that You just did n't
We rented a car
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
We swam The Atlantic it 's not that big really
How did you get here
The sets were excellent Everything was big you know all the rubbish coke cans sweet wrappers dustbins so when you were watching it you felt cat size It was really clever
The sets were good
Yeah It was quite good actually Some bits I really liked
Yeah it was okay
I paid for those guitar cases
Those are n't presents That 's normal friendship stuff
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe Who paid When we went to see 'Cats Who paid
Such as
I 've been buying you stuff all week I 've been buying him stuff all week
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith
No I do n't
You know what for
What for
Put it in the cases Split it up And do n't forget you owe me £150

Fine I thought you were leaving today
How is bank
It 's very strange How many people are truly themselves with their love It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers There are no Marches Against Heartache no Ministries Against Loneliness no Concerts Against Disappointment We look away And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us The one thing we all share but do n't say Look John I will show you something
I suppose it 's I mean define your terms

Well what have you got
I do n't have nothing
I 'm pretty naive Look at you You have to do all this and what have you got to show for it Nothing
You are pretty naive if you think it is
Thank Christ for that
The rest of the world John it 's not all like St Albans
Yeah He 's a smashing bloke
Fifteen You do n't know him He was very kind and strong
Then okay So how old were you when you met him
I was n't saying anything
Please there 's no Oh
What I I was n't saying
You do n't have to say anything
You know in Russia there 's no work for women It 's a different world
Get out
You are throwing me out
Get out
Excuse me
You do n't understand you either
You do n't understand me
So what did you want I think we understand each other no
It was n't what I wanted
You did n't mind too much
I got what I paid for
You
What
Oh I think you will recover okay I think you got what you paid for
I think it 's my safest bet do n't you
So now you hate all women
Well it 's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman or alone for that matter makes me want to die
Why
I do n't like sex I do n't think I 'll be having sex ever again
There 's nothing wrong in liking sex John
Some What does that mean
Sometimes neither
Sometimes which
Sometimes
So what Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you 're with him or what
Listen I did n't go rooting around in your private stuff
Whereas Wet n Wild is an emotional journey Tied and Tethered It 's pretty moving huh Like Anna Karenina
So What then You just detach sex from everything
What 's a moral orgasm John Tell me how it feels exactly
And that would be Morals That would be one 's own moral sense of decency
And who says what is wrong
And It 's wrong
And What are you saying
Okay Let 's Okay Okay You have had sex with people you do n't like have n't you For money To make money
I do n't hate you
So What 's it like having to fuck men you hate
We 'll pretend it never happened
Okay we wo n't talk about it
No
You do n't want to talk about it
Shut up I 'm not listening
Why not
I do n't want to talk about it
No But you tend to tie them up
Yeah I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too
He left me my passport and ticket It 's pretty clear he wants to see me again
Excuse me
He will come back
Not the kids type then is he Not that broody You must be pretty miffed
But you know so what
Of course Of course Of course he does Of course Thank you Thanks
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
Oh Jesus
Look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
So uh
Fine Absolutely Must be disappointing though Must come as a hell of a shock
It 's none of your business
Fine
I do n't want to talk about him
So uh Alexei which I know is n't his name
I said I do n't have any
What
I do n't have any money
Give me some money
Yes
Shut up Have you got your passport
What

What No you 're not
I 'm going to be sick Where 's the
What
Where 's the restroom
Well Nadia It it 's all the same to you I 'd like to give it a bash
You ca n't hurt me more than I 'm hurt already
In every sense If at all possible
So you 're just going to be vindictive
I do I want to very badly
I know you just want to punish me
In the world
No I do n't
You must think I 'm the biggest pillock In the world
Well as it turns out I did
Why else would you send off for me If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
They do n't blame you When a bank employee does this they understand You get your life back Anyway I bet you hated that bank
I 'm going to drink my coffee Then we 're going to the police station Where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison
So what are you going to do
That 's a relief It 's nice to know I 'm a regular guy
It makes it faster If I do n't speak to the men they fall faster It 's pretty obvious why
I do n't want to know
It 's makes it easier Okay
Unless Unless this is part of the routine You get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee
I think that about covers it I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though That 's got to hurt I imagine That 's got to smart a bit I mean strictly in my observer 's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously
You do n't understand anything
Oh I do n't know In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals This took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems But you see I 'm not in that line of work anymore Nowadays I 'm a bank robber

MAE Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume So now they have scented creams They help moisturize a woman 's skin This one 's my favorite It 's called Ginger Souffle I recommend applying the cream while the skin is still damp So perhaps just after a shower
For your hands
MAE These are whipped body creams It 's like a lotion

I guess it could be worse You could be comin back in a body bag
They been keepin a folder on me cuz of my stomach Like how it was just before we 'd play ball back in school Thought it was just some tic I got or ulcers like my daddy had I ca n't shoot Target practice I 'm a pro I tag between the numbers each time but But when there 's really loud noises around me somethin happens I get shaky and I lose my breath They called it anxiety Severe anxiety It can be fixed and all just not in time for It 's a long process but they sent me home

Maybe I 'm a quicker learner
Look you need Ich I 've been here five years and I still ca n't read all the street signs

You have a helluva way of asking for help
You can count on the truth from people who do n't like you
I do n't give tours
I could use some help Show me around I 'll pay you for your time
An outside person A foreigner A barbarian You me More you
Gaiijin
Dead gaiijin 's are big news
There was a change in plans

Then take it from him
Sugai wo n't give it to me you know that
Do n't be
I 'm amused
This is my stop
Time I 've got plenty of
She 's such a long way home for you
Guess I 'm on a roll
I like your friend Joyce You 're lucky
You are a lucky man Where you come from a man can stand out It 's expected Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out
Save it I already took the tour
Ugly A couple of thousand years they 've been bound by these little rules Looking in Always afraid Ugly little lives
I 'm taking you back
Keep the change
Right
Remember counterfeiting is the Feds They 'll be all over Abolofia 's place Stick tight You I.D the other plate he does real time
Your plane 's at nine a.m Be on it That 's orders Period
He killed a police officer
How You do n't know the place You do n't know the language Get on the plane
I planned on catching him Captain
They 're blaming it on you Christ Conklin you did n't even tell me you lost the prisoner
He was my partner
It 's not your job
They said send a detective if I could spare one I can always spare you
Why me
Check your gun before you leave They 're not allowed in Japan It 's a nice safe country
What What if I say no
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home tonight
What
He 's wanted in Japan They want him first Then we can have him
Why
Does n't speak a word of English And he wo n't speak Japanese either No papers The Japanese embassy is very interested
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys detective
Yeah
One guy do all the damage
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer Hotel room and rental car were full of it
Not in that company
Dope
This by this
How big a package we talking about
Goodbye officer
I have to get to Sugai
Do you know where she is detective Do you know how to find her Even where to start We will find them
If anything happens to her while I 'm here
You had my help detective
For God 's sake Ohashi I need your help Let me out of here
Your plane leaves at six Two officers will escort you
Twenty-four hours detective
Hey HEY I 'M TALKING TO YOU INSPECTOR
Look
While you were hanging out at the visa office we found the son-of-a bitch
Your visa has expired Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported
What 's this
Can we skip the poetry inspector
The young are eating the old something that usually does n't happen here
Because I want you to tell me
Why do n't you ask your chief detective
Could you fill me in
Do you know what this is
Hey inspector I do n't intend to take the rap for this
Work with me I want your best detective
You 're foreigners
We 're police officers
It is not allowed
I want a gun
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms carrying official documents
You lost a man we wanted for some time It was very incompetent on your part officer
After a court convicts him He belongs to me
You want him dead too
That was n't our deal
He 'll find out you took me I 'm unprotected He 'll kill us All of us You do n't stand a chance
Good
I do n't have to
You 're smarter than Kobo You know the price of deceit Think about it
If I say no
Swiss bank deposit Gold bullion Whatever you want You know the city and the police
With these
I 'll pay you
You trust me
The other plate is currently in New York in the hands of Kobo 's man Find it for me
Why tell me this
Not with these bills And even if it only took them six months do you know what our profit margin would be
The Feds would be onto you in a month
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar
Yes Unlike our syndicates your criminals do n't understand the words 'honor and 'duty We ca n't afford not to deal with them
The families who control the casinos
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us
He 'll be dealt with
I want him
I took Kobo from the street I gave him a home a future But my ways were too slow for him I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man Kobo would n't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired
Kobo I know He killed two of my partners One in New York one at the printing plant
I 'm impressed But let 's use the short form I 'm looking for
Seven years work by the finest engraver Mass produced sequentially numbered The best there has ever been Mr Conklin
That would n't be very sporting
Then go get him
One man He must be good
You underestimate the trap Mary
Not to be trapped
What 's the point
Anywhere
Where
Let 's go while there is still time
Pris
I do n't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us
I 'm sure glad you found us Sebastian What do you think Mary
Mr Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated We 'll appreciate him and he 'll cooperate
If he wo n't cooperate
He knows what he 's doing
Well stocked
You certainly have a nice place here
We 're not used to the big city Where we come from it 's not so easy to get lost
We were worried to death It 's awfully kind of you
Ca n't thank you enough Mr Sebastian If you had n't come along
Nothing the God of biomechanics would n't let you in heaven for
Also extraordinary things
I 've done some questionable things
I am
Also you 're too valuable to experiment with
Put it this way Rolls Royces are made to last as least they were But I 'm afraid you 're a Ferrari A high strung racing car built to win not to last
But not to last
Would n't obstruct replication but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you 're got a virus again but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells
We 've already tried it ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table
What about E.M.S recombination
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship The ship sinks
Why
The facts of life I 'll be blunt To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system at least by men makers or not it fatal A coding sequence ca n't be revised once it 's established
Come here
I want more life fucker
I 'm afraid that 's a little out of my
Death
What 's the problem
Had in mind something a little more radical
Would you like to be modified
Can the maker repair what he makes
And what can he do for you
It 's not an easy thing to meet your maker
I 'm surprised you did n't come to me sooner
Here 's your check my boy Thank you
Yeah It might be better if we talk in private Sebastian Why do n't you go home
Oh
The name is Batty Roy Batty
No you stay here with us Out last night together
Just thought I 'd
Where are you going Sebastian
Thank you
You 're our best and only friend
This afternoon
When do you deliver your project
No
Be better if I could talk to him in person But he 's not an easy man to get to
I 'd be happy to mention it to him
His company made us
He could
Tyrell could help us Sebastian
He 's not really my friend I just do a job for him now and then
Dr Tyrell
What about your friend the man who owns this building
If we do n't find help soon Pris has n't got long to live
I do n't know much about biomechanics Roy I wish I did but you 're out of my league
You could help us
Of course not
Not only that but we have smiliar problems Accelerated decrepitude But we do n't want to die quite yet
You mean that you ca n't come here and I ca n't go there
We have a lot in common
Like
Like what
Show me something
Nexus 6
What generation are you
You 're androids
What Sebastian
You 're just all so so different
Why are you staring at us
Well actually
Oh no bother I 'd be glad to
If it would n't be too much of a bother a little bite to eat would be
How about breakfast I was just going to make some
Well no not really There 's Mr Deetchum he 's the watchman he lives on the first floor
I like a man who stays put An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times You live here all by yourself do you
Okay but do n't kill him Save a little for everybody A masterpiece
I want to do it
Very good Pris Now show him why
I think therefore I am
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home How are things at home
Then we 're stupid and we 'll die
Hello glad to meet you
This is my Uncle Roy Sebastian
Tomorrow he says
When
He 's not ready yet
What 's going on down there
Go
Yeah I got it
If you do n't we will It has to be total Deckard That 's an order from as high as it comes Got it
Okay here it is Eldon Tyrell his family and half his staff were just massacred The cat is about to get out of the bag Pressure is definitely on The Nexus program is terminated When you finish there locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire
Got it
Take a number Canapt 1700 tenth floor Villa Vita District Olympia South
Who
She 's not with you
Yeah
This is Bryant Are you alone
Yeah
Yeah
Look go home Get some rest Take an aspirin
You did n't like her
I did n't like her
Then let her get away I thought you were a pro you 're supposed to be a fuckin tracker
She was gon na get away
If you hurry you 'll get back before it gets cold I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes Good luck
I was just about to have my dinner
Bryant here Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants Esper 's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell 's got is the entertainment section You better get on it
Yeah
Garbage man
Industrial refuse
What was the cover on the one that got Holden
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model Check it out on the Voight-Kampff There 's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect If that 's the case everybody 's up shit creek
Where do we start
We 're using Esper a 231 that picked up Holden 's alarm Its guess is that all five are in the city
You got a machine on it yet
There was n't much left of him so we ca n't be sure But bio chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees Guess he found himself one
What was he after
Five Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro field
Six huh
Oh Day after tomorrow
Day after tomorrow
When might that be
Soon as I finish the job
Well when do you get paid
Your customer eh
It 's got ta be right for my customer
Nexus designated Zhora incept June 13th 2017 athletic conditioning highly competitive special abilities in the entertainment field
Number three
Nexus designated Pris incept data December 13 2017 competitive programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers
Next
Nexus designated Mary incept November 1 2017 domestic conditioning non competitive trained for day care position
Okay gim me a run-down on the three females
Longevity is classified No
Never mind Do they have that knowledge
Four years Which would make her termination date
The umbrella
And what in your estimation works
Not if it works
Do you have something against science
Yes
I think we 're through for the night
What about a summary then
I know all that
Here 's something you might find interesting They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum However after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism would create its own emotional responses hate love fear anger envy
I 'm coming to that Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull the occipital bone A direct hit is a positive retirement
Okay but
Unlike a five they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run
How do I stop one
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes constructed of skin-flesh culture selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program Are you with me
You start
Why yes of course
You equipped for random questions
This is Esper and I 'm ready Go ahead please
Machines can be helpful sometimes but they can also be a pain in the ass Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill I do n't mind a bum-steer once in a while it 's their personalities that usually get me Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image If that 's true whoever made Esper should have been shot
Four years
My birthday is April 10 2015 How long do I live
I do n't know
How old am I
I got ta piss
One more eh
I like you too
I like you

Sorry do n't have the time
You want to see my friends
Prosit
Prosit
My pleasure
Thank you very much
Shot of vodka please
Vodka
I 'll but you one What 'll you have
But I would like to buy you drink
It 's okay Forget it
I think I have no money
I know what they are Deck Look maybe they can pretend to feel but far as the raw hot emotions of the old heart no way
These are n't just
Love is just another name for sex Love is sexy and sex is lovely I do n't care what you call it an android ca n't have it
I 'm taking a piss
What 's that
I think I 'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes
Let 's hear it
No I got a problem
Money
Yeah But that 's what I wanted to talk to you about
From what I hear you 're doing great Bryant tells me you 're going like a god damn one-man army Making a lot of money huh
I 'm doing okay
Hey it 's okay I like to pee So how are you doing
Sorry
Do n't make me laugh It makes me pee
Well you do n't have to worry about getting it wrinkled
I 'm great I mean I know I 'm not really great but I feel just great How you like my new suit
Me too
My job is here
But if you could
Too old
Why did n't you go
Never been more sure of anything in my life
You sure
They 'll change the limit before I change my mind
What if you change your mind
Listen I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there
You 're going to be over the limit
Nope
But you have n't put in for emigration
True
Considering the nature of your work that could be unhealthy
Huh huh
Your mind kept wandering That bothered me
Yeah
During the road test
Meaning you do n't run as fast as you used to
Meaning
I did n't say that Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time
No rust
Nerves of steel
Silicone Valley Lots of these science guys never leave that place We book two shows a month in there Those big time techs and bio guys might be real high zoners up here but when it comes to the arts they like it loud and lewd
What shows
Lots of places The tours the clubs the Silicone shows private parties
Book the good ones for where
You talking about the Opera House on the Main
That 's what we call in the trade audition free-for alls and most of it sucks Bit I do n't think that 's her
What 's suck night
I did n't know if I wanted to handle her I already got a snake act But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones
What night
Nothing She wanted to know about suck night
The girl that does n't look like that girl
Who
What did she want
This one looks familiar but I do n't know Naw There 's one came in today looks a little like this one but
Do you recognize any of them
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little What am I supposed to be looking for
Of course
I 'd like you to take a look at these pictures
Can I come in
Yes
Taffey Lewis
And who do I go to about you
Me
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress
I bet I would
You 'd be surprised what a guy 'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
Hey Do your job but do n't wreck mine huh
Sorry
Jeezus
Come on
Does it eat
The best
You mean the snake
It 's a good job
Of course he 's not real You think I 'd be working here if I could afford a real snake
It that mother real
For holes
What the fuck for
Oh yeah You 'd be surprised what goes on around here I 'd like to check the dressing room if I could
Are you for real
Like to get this position Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person
How do you mean 'exploited
You have n't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way
I do n't know nothing about it
There 's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place
I 'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists
Yeah
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me
What
You know what I think
Just wait here
What difference will it make
Do n't leave here Do n't open the door do n't answer the phone
No I do n't
Do you think I simulated what happened between us
Andies only simulate suffering if they 're programmed for it
Do n't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered
Because it 's not
Why do you call it retire why do n't you call it murder
Nope Nobody could stand me that long
Ten years
What 's a long time
Uh-huh
You mean a woman
Have you ever known anybody a long time
I never felt better
You 're sick Deckard
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid Part of your education
This feels stupid
I do n't like the noise Just practice Practice makes perfect
But then how can you
Never mind the plug just go through the motions
But if I do n't plug it in how can I
I do n't like people snooping around my stuff
They could clean around the arrangement
It appears to be dirty why do n't you get somebody
Do n't be fooled by appearances
Have you ever cleaned your apartment
Hmmm
When was the last time you cleaned this place
I 'm not sure Is there a secret
Like
I do n't know I think I missed something
What
I do n't know I have nothing to compare it to I guess I thought there was something more to it
It was n't very good last night was it
Nobody is freer than when he dreams I read that
That 's another thing I ca n't do
Yeah
Did you cry when your father died
I wish I could
Yeah Sometimes
Do you dream
If they are smart they take naps
What do people do in the afternoon
Not too good
How are you doing
I am Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out
How come you 're not on the job
Oh
Dead
Where is he
Me and my dad
Who is this
You did n't hear me You were sleeping
You did
I told you I 'd come back
There 's a lot I have n't done with a man before
You ever take a bath with a man before
Sit
What do you want me to do
Do n't just stand there looking at me It 's not polite
Right
They probably want to find out when they were made
Can you I could n't
I can imagine
I 'm sorry
Yeah
Do I make you nervous
So I 'm a piece of equipment Use me
So
You use your equipment do n't you
I work alone
Two of us might be more effective than one
Sounds like I 'm an ass-hole either way but the answer is still no
There 's two reasons a man rejects help Either because he 's so good at what he does he does n't think he needs it or he 's so insecure he ca n't admit it
I think you need more help than you 've got
I 've already got more help than I need
I know you think it complicates your work but I 'm here to help
Is there anything else
Ugh
Last question You 're watching an old movie It shows a banquet in progress the guests are enjoying raw oysters
Sounds like you speaks from experience
It would be my child
In your opinion
That would be murder Mr Deckard
Why not
I 'd never get an abortion
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend and you decide to get an abortion
You show the picture to your husband He likes it and hangs it on the wall The girl is lying on a bearskin rug
Is this testing whether I 'm an android or a lesbian
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl
I 'd kill it
You 're watching T.V and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
I 'd take him to the doctor
You have a little boy He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar
I would n't accept it Also I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police
For the responsibility of your power Being a police bureaucrat you 've got more than your share
Why should I be
Are you apprehensive
Of course not
It 's artificial
But because your department ca n't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large it 's a problem Correct Mr Deckard
A humanoid robot is like any other machine it can be a benefit or a hazard If it 's a benefit it 's not our problem
It seems your department does n't believe out new unit is to the public benefit
I 'll see you in a minute
Severed spine You 'd better get in here Bryant 's waiting for you
Bad
Holden got hit
What 's up
Next time you go on vacation do me a favor let us know where it is
You know where I been I been on vacation
Where the hell you been
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer an Esper 231 I believe and a photo over-lay packet is being produced
Discreetly
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground
Five maybe six
How many questions does it usually take Mr Deckard
Memory implant She was programmed But I think she has transcended her conditioning I think she was beginning to suspect
She did n't know
Thirteen
How many questions did it take
The machine works She is
If she is the machine works
Well
Sitting next to you
One that relies on human interpretation Where 's the subject
Like you said Mr Deckard a machine can be a hazard The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine is n't it
Nothing is infallible but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof
But in your profession that is a risk
No
Have you ever retired a human by mistake
Go ahead
May I ask a personal question
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response Plus fluctuation of the pupil plus involuntary dilation of the iris
Yes
Is this to be an empathy test
Please
Black
Thanks
Almost through
'S VOICE I 'm tired of this
You 're not responding to the stimulus I can see right here I 'm not getting a reading
'S VOICE How do you know I 'm not
We 're going to have to start the sequence again if you do n't stay with me Deckard Concentrate
'S VOICE Sorry
Let 's keep our eyes on the road Deckard
I mean you 're not helping Why is that Leon
Whatcha mean I 'm not helping
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back Leon

This is your bedroom
No wait At least stay for dinner
We have to go
I ca n't explain it now But I want you to set the locks for two months You have more than enough of everything Then we 'll be back to get you
What
Mom Eve and I have to go
A psychiatrist
I think I 'm being chased by a psychiatrist
Are you in trouble son
and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down But we 've got to hurry
Heck I know that mom You 're my parents
Your father has a few final words for you You know he 'd fight a buzz saw for you he loves you so much We both do
Yes ma'am
Here 's the shopping list and 3,000 which should take care of everything
Yes ma'am
Oh Adam that would be wonderful if you could find a girl One who 's not a mutant and hopefully comes from Pasadena Nothing against Valley girls but in my day anyhow the girls from Pasadena I do n't know always just seemed a little nicer
I was thinking that uh you know while I was up there and all that maybe I could you know try to meet a girl I 've been thinking about that a little just these last fifteen years or so
Yes
Mom
I just hope this is still good up there
Right
Yes ma'am
I do n't know how far you 'll have to travel to find supplies but if you ca n't get home by nightfall I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn Write that down It 's a hotel There might still be one standing
You 're my brave boy
I 'll be all right
I 'm afraid you 've got to
I 'll go up
He seems to be doing all right now I do n't know if he 's had a heart attack or just a horrifying experience But we need supplies and I 've got to stay with him
Oh no Oh my goodness Let 's get him into the bedroom
Dad
You never know You may someday dine at the White House with the president
Sorry Mom
Elbows Son
Yes ma'am
Oh A nice one I hope
Let 's all remain calm That 's the key thing
I was frightened and I did n't know what to think But you know-I believe him I think he just wants to go home Wherever the hell that is
And now you must let me be the judge of that
You know I do n't think so I 'm confused but you know I do n't think he 'd ever hurt me I do n't think he 'd hurt anyone
Calm down please This man needs help and you need protection from him That 's obvious
No I ca n't have that They 'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs
I have to If a complaint is made and the person resists obser
No Not the police Do n't call them
He 'll catch him Hi This is Nina Aron I 've got a run away and I 'm going to need police assistance
Oh my God
Yeah
Good god
Yeah
He drank it hot
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here She 'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr Pepper
All back East
What about relatives
Unless we get a postcard or somethin that 's my guess
Well he and Mrs Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit
According to Caltech this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase
No I ca n't I 'm sorry I have to go I have to
WALKER Uh-huh And it 's all yours for the remarkably low price of only 200 And if you act now I might even throw in some free lawn furniture
Really
WALKER Cute Little Old Man if you want a boy I can be a boy And if you want a girl I can be a girl I can be anything you want me to be
Yes I can tell that just looking around Boy Did you say you were a country boy
WALKER Hell up here Honey it 's been hell up here down there and over yonder Hell everywhere
Yes yes the song So tell me has it been hell up here
WALKER The blast Honey I have survived a host of things Like the song says A country boy can survive
So you survived the blast did you
WALKER Good
What A light Yes I 've got a light
WALKER You got a light honey
What can I offer you Eve
Some time
Well please excuse us We we have n't entertained a guest in um
To keep what 's up there from getting down here It 's not the radiation I 'm worried about
Well that 's considerably shorter than before I was wondering Calvin why set the locks at all I mean the radiation is gone and
I thought ten years
How long will you set it for this time
Amen
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son Adam Amen
Yes dear I know
He 's smart
do as I say
And the ocean A mountain range
and we will
I want him to at least see the sky
Well I am the head of this household
No Calvin We 're not going to make do Not me Not Adam We 're going up no matter what We deserve it Even if it 's terrible
We 'll make do I 'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then
For how long We 've just about run out of everything
Excuse me
Yes
We do
We stay down here
Oh my Oh my oh my oh my So what do we do now
They 've done a lot of re-building but society at least as we knew it has utterly collapsed People throw up in the streets Others point guns There 's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and and I I ca n't tell you the rest I just ca n't
I do n't believe it
Yes
No
Others are multi-sexual It seems they can be both masculine and feminine simultaneously
It 's not a pretty sight Some eat out of garbage cans Others are cover your ears Son and hum I mean that literally and I mean right now
Mutants
I 'm going to give it to you straight There 's no point in beating around the bush There were survivors Apparently the fallout has created a subspecies of mutants
Yes That 's right
It 's an archaic colloquialism roughly meaning good
Yes yes it is
Just open the door
Should we say a little prayer first
I know exactly what you mean Hey honey
Oh yes It just fascinates me how all these things work
In the generator room again
Sure
Would you excuse me
You know when we do go up I 'm going to miss this old place How 'bout you hon
Yes
If we still have one
Yeah Let 's dig in
Let 's eat our cake
Well we 'll be going up in two years We 'll know then I 'm very hopeful
Calvin Webber What a thing to say
One who does n't glow in the dark
Well we did in my family
Oh that 's just a bunch of baloney We never believed that in my family
If he tells it wo n't come true
What did you wish for Adam
And I made these
No kidding Who else would have done it
You bet
Get the presents and do the lights
Coming
Calvin
Hi
Hi honey
I believe there will be other survivors In fact I 'm guessing there 's life on the surface even now It 's not life worth living perhaps but believe me something 's moving around up there And I do n't just mean the cockroaches
Oh Calvin I 'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps ca n't be kept
Yes you certainly will And you 'll find a nice girl and rebuild America Just the way it used to be
Nonsense People have no idea what the human mind is capable of Look at us
Yes he 's very bright dear Much like his father But you know Calvin maybe he 's a little young for school
Not bad for a three and a half year old I 'd like to see the public school system match that I do n't care how terrific it is
What
Watch this
Yes Well yes
Very nice Unless it caved in too
No reason Well it 's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off So you know when the time is up we 'll have to return to the surface using you know this back entrance Which is very nice because it has the service elevator
Why
Oh I was just examining this rear hatchway
We looked all over for you What are you doing back here
Right here
Calvin
What Whatever you want Helen
If I you know
Yes
And I was wondering if if I could have a
No I think it 's just right
What shall we call him
I 've noticed
No Calvin Babies cry
Is there a problem
Honey
Uh oh Now it 's time
What
Oh no
I told you I 've got everything
You have tranquilizers
Would you like a tranquilizer
No No Calvin this is different Believe me
How could you This is just like home
Maybe I 've just got the creeps
Really
No Calvin you 're favorite
Hot Dr Pepper Your favorite
I 'm not hungry
Burnt to a crisp I 've given you the most well-done cut
All our friends
We have to be strong sweetheart If not for ourselves for the child
No
Hi honey Feeling better
To go up
To go up
It 's safe
Then after that it 's safe
Thirty five years
To keep us from trying to leave After an atomic blast there 's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years
The locks
The locks
What 's that noise
To you maybe
Home sweet home
As long as we 've got that straight
Yes dear
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber when this baby comes you 're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers
I 've read up on it I 'll deliver the baby myself if I have to
But what if I go into labor That could happen any time
Rather safe than sorry That 's my motto
Days
I do n't know For this thing to blow over it could take days
How long will we have to stay down here
Yeah yeah Okay Give me the roast and watch your step I 'll come back for the radio
Oh much worse But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip You remember that
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip
Cheese is particularly troublesome
I just hope those plates are n't radioactive by tomorrow morning
Calvin I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes It 's not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates
Yes
You hear that
I never know anymore
No They all do
Did you rig it to do that You 're so clever
It shuts off automatically
Time Oh no Calvin It 's not time yet I still have
It 's time
We 'll do this again Maybe next week Here 's your hat Could I wrap something up for you Did you have a coat
I 'm sorry everyone but given this extraordinary turn of events I think it 's prudent that we cut the evening short I 'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself but in the meantime I 'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance
You bet hon
Well put it down and come in
Sorry honey I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat
For Pete 's sake Calvin We 've got guests
I guess we should n't fight in here
Stop it you two
Yeah Before I kick your ass
Go home Adam Go to your hotel
You know I do n't know And looking at you I do n't care It 's been too long Eve
So where is your roommate the model
Shana Gillroy 's apartment Remember her The model who went to Harvard Well I better get going Bye Adam Nice coat
Go home Cliff wherever that might be
This is Adam Adam meet Cliff
Hey they 're Ralph Laurens And who 's this interesting looking fellow
You came back for these
Your stuff Let me see that
I forgot some of my stuff
What are you doing here
What are you bitching about now
Stop
Where
Adam
Yeah Maybe he 'll call
Well we 've come a long way have n't we I want to go home
None of this stuff was here in 1962 The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop
Come on
An adult bookstore He was very excited about seeing it You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley
What
No No wait a minute We stopped at a porno store
You did n't stop anywhere else
We came back to the house
Then what
To get some frozen poultry
Well at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich That 's new Wait a minute He said today he knew where home was What happened this morning Where did you go
I do n't know I like to think so
He was always so nice How was I supposed to know that 's a good thing Nice is weird Nice is what is nice It 's not cool I 'll tell you that Was it ever
Yeah That 's thinking
Have him committed
Millions upon millions upon millions The cards The stock The clothes The toothpaste The guy was on the level And you blew it A man walks into your life who is the kindest most polite honest trustworthy incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life And what do you do
See these Found them in the box with the cards These are stock certificates IBM AT T Polaroid
I do n't know Everything 's so neat It 's all just so goddamn dear Damn
What 's wrong
We 'll find him
And if we ca n't find him
Give it back to him
What do you want to do with it
Fallout shelter
Good God you do n't think there really is a bomb shelter do you
Oh Well you 're certainly welcome
Gay
What
Oh no
I know I know You did the right thing
Well what was I supposed to do He wants me to live underground with him That 's like Silence of the Lambs do n't you think
Coward
I do n't think so
You 're goddamn right I am
What are you going to do Go over to her place and kick in the door
Oh no Not Sophie No way Please do n't tell me that
It 's true She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear
What
He left with Sophie
Well I admit it I 'm glad to hear that
He did n't leave with them
So now I suppose he 's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
From the oddest place His parent 's told him I do n't think I got that memo
Where did he get all that information
Exactly I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses Turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible That 's it If you do n't do that nothing else matters The cars the clothes the houses
Well consider the source I do n't even know what a lady is
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady
What
You know I asked him about that And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them See you 'd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners I did n't know that I thought it was a way of appearing superior Know what else he told me
Or have perfect table manners
Yes you do
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
Uh yes you do
And I do n't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
Yes you do
In the first place I do n't fall in love with weirdos I 've only known for four or five days
What Now hold on Wait one damn minute
Yeah I 'm not the one who 's in love with the guy
To bed
To bed
Where are you going
Yeah But who 's not a slut these days
Those sluts
Hey you 're the psychic Eve the psychic pimp You tell me
I 'm his pimp He left with the dancers did n't he
What 's it to you
Who did he leave with
We did not leave together
What 's that mean
Uh..he might of
He go back to the hotel
Right here Well you 're being so bossy I was n't sure
Go to the bathroom
It 's not so much what you say but how you say it Women like men who are unpredictable
Um Eve
Adam I think for you we should go for sweet
Well I 'm trying to educate him It 's nothing personal
Eve
Are you kidding You would n't even be a crumb on her table You do n't see that
For him It does n't work for the rest of us
Always good advice
Just be yourself
He 's from Alaska
That water 's freezing
No
How 'bout it Eve Can he skate around your block
Let me show you the entire trousseau
I think it works
Well what do you think
What do you think Adam
I 'm busy tomorrow anyway I have to buy six thousand paper napkins
Alright I will
That 's what I 'm sensing
Yeah Like Ralph Lauren
I see elegant
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing do n't you
I 'm sorry But if the shoe fits
Well that 's blunt
It means that your taste in men 's apparel is as bad as your taste in men
What 's that supposed to mean
You 're serious are n't you
Money is no object He 's got cards up the wazoo
I do n't know
Exactly You understand that do n't you You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that
But first you have to start with the clothes
Oh my God
Give me your hand
I even guessed his hotel did n't I
Oh yes
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs
Out-of-town That 's all he 'll say
So Adam where on earth are you from
Darlin this is X-File stuff Think about it The guy 's got all this easily negotiable property He 's obviously setting something up very big Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America for instance Or perhaps he 's the head of a cult that 's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco I 've heard worse
I knew you 'd like him
Eve This guy is un-be-liev-able
I 'll give it to ya no money down The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway
JERK Yeah Yeah that 's it
Buy it from me
JERK Could I like oh wow like uh
I 'm selling this place I want out of this hell hole

Yes Is that so surprising Yeah I worry a lot I got you into this
You worry about me really
Yeah you 're a mystery I like you Very much
You like mysteries that much
I 'm seeing something that was always hidden I 'm involved in a mystery I 'm learning And it 's all secret
Jeffrey Why
Yeah
I ca n't believe what you are finding out Are you going to continue with this Are you going back to her apartment
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man 's place
Jeffrey
Number two I saw the Yellow Man come out This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance Number three Now get this In the distance was a murder A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken
Oh yeah
Maybe But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs I think Frank supplies him
Nothing really but it 's interesting They know each other They seem to like each other
Number one I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank 's building laughing with Frank Now the only trouble is what does this prove
Shoot
That 's what makes it so good You wanta hear what I saw today
You know that cheese is practically all chemicals
Yeah but I do n't think it 's going to do much good Let 's go I 'll try to talk to him later
You want to go talk to him
What am I going to do
I 'm really sorry
You were late
See ya tomorrow
Goodnight
Okay okay

Can I give you a kiss good night
Okay Sandy
Okay be careful
I will I 'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five okay
No silly I 'm still in school you know But I 'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you 've learned You better be careful Jeffrey
I guess so You want to help me watch Frank I 'm going to stake out Frank 's place tomorrow with a camera
So are you I mean you 're a neat guy We better get back
Yeah I guess so You 're a neat girl
I do n't know I had a dream In fact the night I met you In the dream the world was dark because there were n't any robins You know birds Robins stood for love and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference I guess until the robins come there is trouble
Why are there people like Frank Why is there so much trouble in this world
You 're sure right It is a strange world
That 's what I thought
Who me Why should it
That does n't bother you does it
Yeah
Yeah I mean a little you know
Did you see her undressed
Yes
Twice Without her sensing anything
Actually I 've been in twice
You saw a lot in one night
I do n't see how I can and I ca n't prove any of this I got all this information illegally Also it could get you in trouble
Wow Should you tell my father
OK It 's a strange world Sandy This is what I have found out What I think I have found out Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don They have a son I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don 's ears I think he is holding them to make her do things for him I think she wants to die The ears were for her a warning to stay alive There is another man involved I call him the yellow man You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door I do n't know what he does but I think he 's on drugs supplied by Frank Frank is a very dangerous man
You want to tell me about it
No way I 'm about to blow up
You want a Dairy Queen
It 's okay Do n't worry about it
I 'm sorry I did n't
He got a little jealous
What 's with Mike
Well Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else you know what I mean
What did you see
Well I 've found out some things nothing really for certain There are some strange people involved
Well how did it go What happened
Okay okay Bye
That 's for me to know and for you to find out I 'll see you I mean call you okay
I do n't know if you 're a detective or a pervert
Okay thanks
I 'll honk four times so you 'll hear it and know she 's on her way up Okay
Are you sure
I 'm going to wait here until she comes
Yeah
Call tomorrow It 's okay Good luck I hope you can sneak out okay You 're going to wait until she 's asleep
Look it can wait till Sunday
Okay yeah call
Oh okay can I call
I I do n't want to see you tomorrow Mike 's coming over
I 'm going in Sandy I 'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went
I wish you would n't do this It does n't make any sense Let 's go somewhere and have some coffee
Could you wait a little while this key may not fit
OK
Leave it in the front of your house for me okay
Yeah but
It 'll be okay I do n't think you should wait out here though I think you should go home Can you drive this car
It 's crazy and dangerous My God I should n't have told you
Why not
Jeffrey I do n't think you ought to do it
I 'll drink to that
Here 's to An interesting experience
Two
That sounds good
This is not my usual Friday night
Then we 'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there
Brilliant
First of all we 're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens We 'll watch her for awhile I 'd like to hear her sing anyway and then also we 'll know she is there and not in her apartment
What 's the plan
Okay You better get out before someone sees us
Yeah but do n't pick me up My father may think it 's strange I 'll walk over to your house I 'll be there at eight o'clock
Great I 'll pick you up around eight o'clock Is that good
I already know The Slow Club It 's on Route 7
First of all we 'll have a nice dinner Try to find out where Dorothy sings
I 'll tell Mike I 'm sick There 's a game tonight anyway and he 'll never miss me Afterwards he can go out with the guys Just so the record is kept straight though I love Mike What do want me to do
I do n't want you to get involved really I mean I do but if something went wrong I mean like you said they may be involved in murder
You really want to do this do n't you
Well it 's Friday night and you 're a beautiful girl I guess you would have a date that does that
Yes I do
You did n't goof it up but you still owe me one I want to sneak in tonight It 's Friday do you have a date tonight
I owe you since I goofed up this one
Pretty clever Are you game for more
So what 's next
Yeah
Yeah if it opens the door
I did n't get a good look at him either but he sure looked at me I did n't have time to get a window but I found this key Pretty nifty huh
No I only saw his back He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall
Yes and no Did you recognize him
I was just about to go to the door when that man did my job for me Was it alright
Yeah let 's get outta here What happened
Are you alright
Alright Good luck yourself
Thanks Dorothy Vallens Okay goodluck Three minutes no sooner
Oh brother Dorothy Vallens Seventh Floor Look on the mailbox for her number bright boy
Okay I 'm going ahead Wait a minute what 's her name
Let 's go
Alright
Now we 'll walk over so there 's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes I can stall if it 's more but I need time to find a good window alright
You 've got a point there
Let 's just try the first part If that goes well we 'll see about the rest No one will suspect us because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this
I do n't know it sounds like a good daydream but actually doing it is too weird Too dangerous
You will be a Jehovah 's Witness I have a few Awake magazines for you You do n't have to keep her very long A few seconds is all I 'll need Whatiya think
What will I say when she comes to the door
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man I will spray her apartment After a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window
Now how are you going to do that
Alright the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later
It would n't hurt to hear the plan I guess
Settle down I have a plan which I think will work There is very little for you to do but I do need your help Are n't you curious about my plan
You said it was a strange world And you 're the strangest part of it Are you crazy She is possibly involved in murder This gives me the creeps
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience Sometimes in some cases it 's necessary to take a risk I got to thinking I 'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman 's apartment you know sneak in and hide and observe
Alright now tell me What is it
Ooooo you are smart Just do n't get too smart
I guess Mike 's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon
I 'm here are n't I
I do n't want to cause any trouble
Just a minute pull over and wait a minute
I 'd like to talk to you about something
I do n't know
You hungry or thirsty or both
Yeah Good bye
I guess so Like you said It 's a strange world
I guess I 'll see you sometime
Thanks for the tour It was nice talking to you
I 've got ta go in
I do n't know He moved away
What happened to him
It 's not bad but it 's bad enough It 's a lot worse for my father I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world
Still it must be kinda rough
I have to help out in my father 's hardware store They 're giving me sort of my own hours for a while which is nice
Yeah I guess so What are you going to do now that you 're home
You really do hear a lot do n't you
My father is watching the businessman The businessman had a partner who disappeared Left his whole business and family his wife and two kids They think he 's been murdered
Oh yeah What about those other people Anything
I do n't know like I said she 's not my father 's case
Did they find out anything when they questioned her
I do n't know you 're not supposed to see them They 're supposed to see you
Where are they
That 's the building She lives on the Seventh Floor Do n't stop to look long the police are watching
Not really why You want to see the building Come on I 'll show you
I guess you have to get back home soon
Yeah It 's close by that 's what 's creepy They 've had her under surveillance for a couple of months except I do n't know what they 've found out because my father is n't in charge of her
It 's a strange world is n't it Do you know what building the woman lives in
Maybe so
The ear is from a missing person maybe
No this has been going on for some time Several months About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river They were from people who were reported missing They never found one complete body only parts
Were all these people questioned this afternoon
There were at least three maybe four But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear There 's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned And a musician And some others
Do you know who was brought in for questioning
I do n't really know much but bits and pieces I hear things My room is right above my father 's office The ear there 's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person That 's direct from the Coroner 's Office The person is unknown There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear I heard some of the same names
Come on you brought it up Do you know anything
Did n't my father tell you not to talk about it
What do you know about the ear Anything
That 's too bad
I 'm home from school My father 's in the hospital
Yeah What are you doing now
What else is new Right
Terrible boring

Yes
No You 're not bothering me You a senior
Am I bothering you

Yeah I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him like he was a ghost or something
Listen kid I think you better understand who you 're dealing with here

We 're alive
And we will send you to whatever God you wish
For if you do there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three And on that day you will reap it
There are varying degrees of evil We urge you lesser forms of filth Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption into our domain
These are not polite suggestions They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost
Do not kill do not rape do not steal These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies
With every breath we shall hunt them down
It is your evil who will be sought by us
It is your corrupt we claim
We do not want your tired and sick
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry
Now you will receive us
He 's a good man
He is n't to be touched
And he is one smart man
That 's the guy that got us off the hook with the Checkov thing
A-fuckin'-men
There he goes Okay gentlemen Are we ready to bring this man into the light Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord
Rocco this is the real deal We must kill without hesitation without guilt or remorse Evil man dead man

Friends Gentlemen They were friends
How do you figure
The shooter knew these guys huh
That 's just fucking weird I have no idea
And it 's the same story over here Why the crossover Theories
No This guy is big time These two are street-walking scum
Maybe the three of them had something in common
Nah too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza Besides if you 're a hitter you 're either working for the Russians or the Italians There 's no riding the fence Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit Something new is going on here
Only two did the shooting So what are you thinking Russian retaliation
Three
Of course they were How many
They were wearing masks
Can she I.D them
She was in here when it went down
That depends You either do your job or get ethical
So what do we do now
Fan-fuckin-tastic
Uh two shooters
And number three Dolly
Yeah well I 'm an expert in name ology
Holy shit You 're the first one that 's ever got that
Male or female bitch
It was It was
Peeperman WRONG What color was it
Pee Per Man
Your what bitch I 'll shoot myself in the head you can tell me that cats name Go ahead Your what Your precious little
My my
Your what Your fuckin what
You killed my my
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship
You oh god why
I killed your fuckin cat you druggie bitch
Where 's my cat
What
Rocco
No Fuck you You start getting excited We got ta fucking go
Fucking figures Look are you guys seeing the pattern here We got big questions at both of these crime scenes with no answers WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths WHY did he do the bartender It would seem unnecessary even stupid God I hate cold crime scenes I 'm fucking leaving now And do me a favor tell me when the next guy dies cause these guys are not done yet
Well we did n't get any help on that A lot of people saw it Nobody 's talking
Duffy This look like a fucking post office to you This guy came in here with intent Maybe he did n't know exactly what he was gon na do but he had a pretty good idea The bartender was n't a fucking accident
Crime of passion He just went nuts He would have shot everyone in here He just ran out of bullets
These two fucking scenes are related Too many coincidences Same day Five hours apart Dead mobsters on both scenes Now why did he kill the bartender
Why was I not informed of this
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight Fled the scene Do n't have much on him
What
Jesus I just ca n't think anymore That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out
Those doors were down which means this They looked down in through the peep hole saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside Pop pop pop right through the glass Why
No way they could have seen it
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry as I 'm sure you 've never been in one of these places before A man goes into the booth puts the money in the slot The dancer gets it on the other side She hits the button door goes up now there is only glass between you and it 's little fireman time
And is there an American shit is there a man seated among us that has n't thought about it many times let 's just put them all on an island give them guns and let them kill each other This is our wet dream come true You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law then bury it from here on out
It 's gon na look like the bad guys are killing each other
Now what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you
Possible but unlikely The angles are too extreme A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gon na shoot straight ahead He would n't cock out his elbows makes no sense Besides you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds No way Had to be at least two
What about one guy with two guns
Now stay with me boys What did they do to make two such identical wounds Did one guy put him on his knees pop a cap in sit him back up and shoot him again the same way No Two men of similar height dropped this guy down each put some iron to his head and boom That 's all she fuckin wrote
Excellent Number two Greenly
They shot him at a downward angle They put him on his knees
The two bullets went in here through the top of the skull criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs This one clue tells us three distinct facts Number one Duffy
The Sicilians
The Greeks The Italians
Yeah Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead or silver
That 's a possibility Y'know you Boston cops are perking up That 's two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally sized men Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent
New hitman wants to leave his mark
And the pennies
He was the only one done right Two in the back of the head
Well Freud was right So you think they came for the fag man huh And what do you base this upon
The fat man
The what man
These guys were pros I think they were coming for one target the fag man he was the
So Duffy got any theories to go with that tie
Really want to know
So what are you thinkin here
Why do n't you let me do the thinking huh genius
What if it was just one guy with six guns
Oh that 's just BEAUTIFUL All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it 's unrelated Greenly the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me I will have a fucking tag on my toe Now get me a squad car and get me over there I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements NOW
A couple of peons for the mob and
Who were the victims
They were n't related The guy used a 38 No pennies Totally amateur
No way they could have seen it
Witness
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth After she watches them whack him she passes out Why the two extra victims
It tells us that he was the last to die All these men Were carrying They came in dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man Did n't they Duffy They sure as fuck did
Uh Shit I uh
Shit Shit
While Greenly 's getting coffee anybody else want anything
Eight
How many bodies Greenly
Respect is earned Greenly never given Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table
Why do you always disrespect me like that
He 's struck again has n't he Greenly
Sweet-n-low
Chief what the fuck is this
Twist of lemon
Who the
Detective Greenly Who the fuck are you
Brilliant So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory Top fucking notch What 's your name
That 's one big fuckin shoe and think about it Of all the ways to kill a guy crushin him to death That 's very particular You do n't get many of those I dunno I feel something big here I would n't be surprised if we see more of these turning up
We promise
Promise me boys
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that He 's got ta learn ta respect women the way Connor does

Right now
Thank you Father thank you Whatever Goodbye amen
Forgive me father
Yes Yes I was thinking that too No I was feeling it All I needed was to hear you say it Amen I 'll help them
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man
No They would never do that
Do you think they would harm an innocent man for any reason
Yes
You know them personally
I believe these young men are right
Then you must find out what your beliefs are
I want to stand for what I believe in father
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision
You 're right
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion It is harder to take small hints from God your feelings and listen to them to take a stand
I guess not
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here
Has he now
You feel A soul is what gives you feelings Happiness guilt right or wrong It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today You feel these men are necessary The Lord has spoken to you twice this day
Yes
You feel
Yes
You believe
But in this day and age I believe what they do is necessary I feel it is correct
God 's permission God does n't
It 's ethics I put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these cocksuckers to slip through I 've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist As if they have God 's permission But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them technically
What is it my son
Why have I come to a church I never have before I guess I just felt I should
Why have you come to a church for council if you 're not religious
Y-Yes my son
Hello You there

You got to be kidding me
Yeah
He did
I do n't think so I mean Actually he robbed Bob 's house
So is Mr Henry going to come by and see me or anything

Look you 're going to do fine It 's OK to be scared
I do n't want to be too much of a liability
I do n't think you will

Sure
That 's Applejack You want to meet him
Who 's in the car
Ah Couple days ago
When 'd you get back
What are you going to do get married Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats And go around scrubbing the
Shut up
You 're in love with the fucking housekeeper
I know that But
That 's what she is
Her name 's Inez Stop calling her the housekeeper
A 500 tip For the housekeeper
She needed it
You gave 383 to the goddamn housekeeper What the fuck is your problem
383
How much
I had to give some to Inez
Where 's the rest
I know
Sixteen dollars
That 's not correct
We 've got sixteen dollars
You 're so spoiled What is not good to you Only a few hundred
Our money situation is not good
You ca n't just run home every time things get tough First of all we 've got enough dough to
I 'm not But there 's
Do n't panic Anthony
I think we better go home
No I 'm serious He made me a diagram
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted
Yes I do Bob taught me
You do n't know how to hotwire
I do n't think we need any keys Dignan I think I can hotwire a car for us
Dignan I ca n't do that All right I just ca n't
No one to back me up Now I have a good idea So unless you come up with something better
Shh
Look I 'm ready to get the fuck out of here It 's real torture for me to be here Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans
I do n't know Dignan I just
She does n't need to know
What I 'm saying is she would n't go for that
I know we can It 's real simple We go into a room grab some car keys and
I do n't think we can do that
Inez has a master key to all these rooms does n't she Does n't she
What
I have an idea for that
We need a car
I do n't really feel like talking about it The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place
Man I 'm sorry We just went for a walk
Would of been nice
I wish I 'd been there
Can you hand me those french fries
I ca n't believe he just jumped you
OK
Why do n't you come with us
No I 'm going to swim I 'll see you later
We 're going over to this bar if you feel like going
Well the world is a little bit colder today
I did n't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself Dignan
If you 'd gone with Bob you 'd probably be in Weatherford by now Of course I 'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped
If you say so
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I 'd be dead
Bob went to help his brother I understand that and I ca n't help it if you do n't
So when you were saying Bob 's at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act You were just
Well I did n't do it did I
If you wanted to go What were you going to do Just leave me here by myself
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go
He told you and you let him do it
You were asleep
Where was I
This morning
When 'd he tell you
That 's a long time to be in jail
We said 48 hours
He went back for his brother
He took his stuff He 's gone I should of seen this I should of expected it Bob does n't have any character
Maybe he just went to the store
That coward Son of a bitch
Right here
Where was it parked
He 's gone He stole the car
Yes It 's true
But if it was n't for Dignan I probably would of died
They blamed my family for everything They always said Mr Langston saved Anthony 's life
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan 's again
Mr Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation CPR I 've never said this before but frankly I thought Anthony was dead The veins in his face were all sticking out His skin was blue He truly did look dead
This was in fourth grade
See one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr Langston 's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious I had to dive in and save him
Do n't worry about it Bob
See now we 've got a plan
Bob
Obviously That 's a given
As long as he gets out OK
Now that makes sense We 'll hang out for a couple of days Get a little R R Make sure Future Man 's OK and then get back on the road
No no Look OK Let 's stay here until we find out what 's going on
He needs to hire an attorney
No kidding
She 's from Cuba
On the left
Which one was that
No Not really Inez speaks a little
They do n't
No I did n't Dignan they do n't speak English
Anthony we 're on the run from the law here Did you tell these people your real name
What What 's the matter
What the fuck is going on here
Sure
May I have a word with you please
Jerry And this is my associate Cornelius
Inez this is
Hi
This is Inez Carmen Anita
No We did n't
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut
Even if it 's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not
No Dignan I 'm sorry I ca n't do that
Then you 're going to have to dye it Anthony We 've got to hide our identities Especially after Bob crashed the car
Dignan I ca n't get my hair cut That 's just not possible all right
True
Yeah but you would n't have the truck if you blew it up
Actually If you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over
It 's not a plan It 's just
Right Get back to me on that one Once your plan is worth a shit
I know But once you get inside you 're home free
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal Anthony
It 's a great shirt Do n't worry about it
No I 'm not saying her I 'm just saying I do n't know
Look man She did n't know anything about shirts
Bob
You owe me fifty bucks
On your marks Get set go
OK Go ahead
I 'll say it
I 'll just say it
You were spoiled rotten
Do n't call me spoiled Dignan
That 's real cool Anthony Yeah I wore boots My parents would n't buy me any 200 running shoes like yours I was n't spoiled
You 've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life Dignan In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E
Really OK Dad But seriously Anthony These are fast shoes
Well those treads stink You 'd blow a knee out racing on those
They obviously were n't designed for racing
What about them
Look at the treads on those
Yes they are
Dignan those are n't running shoes
See if mine are in there
Anthony we 're on the run This is an emergency It 's only fair that
I keep it for emergencies
Well then cut it in half
I do n't want to use it
She 's not going to notice Anthony
Because my mom gets the bill
Why not
I do n't like to use that credit card Dignan
Can I get that credit card from you
Do n't even say it man
I did n't realize you were so sensitive to Bob 's feelings Considering I did the plans you 're actually lucky you got
He was the driver Dignan He did what he 's supposed to do
Anthony he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress He got what he deserved
What do you think
What 's wrong with him
Like I 'm going to hunt you down and kill you
Like he would find Dignan One day
Yeah
Like he meant it
I swear to God In a very quiet voice
Oh shit That was scary In the middle of the robbery The manager looks at me Right in the eye And goes I 'm going to remember you
What about what that guy said
We got it We got it
Holy shit
Unlock that door Check the aisles
Is that the manager
We know there 's another stocker
There 's another stocker right
Where 's the other stocker
Where 's the manager
You 're right You 're right
Calm down Take a deep breath
Dignan Stop
You 're out I 'm not working with either one of you
Dignan calm down
No Dignan It 's not your gun It 's all of ours
Anthony give me the fucking gun
Nothing Go ahead
Now One thing we need to discuss is timing Timing is absolutely crucial What are you doing Anthony
That 's a good question No I do n't I 'm just being hypocritical here However I will say
You think we 're going to be chased
OK Escape route The most important thing you can have is an escape route Just in case somebody 's tailing us Or even chasing us as the case may be
Just turn right here
Loop around real fast
Yeah
Is it back in
Hang on a second
But he did n't say anything
That 's not bad
Eight dollars
Holy shit What 'd I tell you
Five seven eight dollars
Yeah I heard that
It had an alarm
No just do it real quick I 'll meet you down there
That sets it off
I do n't think so Just reach on in
Dignan it 's got an alarm
I 'm lookout
Yeah I saw it
Did you see that
That 's not what I meant Dignan
You 're making fun of my family You know there 's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig You know exactly what you 're saying
How was I ridiculing you
I do n't appreciate you ridiculing me
Where are you going
Then you should n't of gone in there Dignan Maybe we should of robbed your house Did you ever think of that
Yeah but I ca n't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary There 's just not time for it
That does n't make any difference I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday They have a very special value for her
Every valuable item in the house was on that list
The list Dignan I know you remember the list because you signed it Things Dignan was not supposed to touch
I know about money Anthony I know the value of money Plus the earrings are worth three times that
But Dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
Anthony we 'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone That 's less than what it 's appraised at
What do you think the cops have
It 's got a V-8 Dignan
She 's an attractive older woman
She 's really kind of hot
See your mind is very good with the more mechanical details Whereas my strength would be
Now that window can never be locked It 's impossible
Who knows That 's why I filed it down
Would they do that
That 's true But what if they change the locks
Kind of Except we 've already got the keys
Did you see what I meant about the window
No This is he
This is he
He says This is he
What does Starsky say
The point is the killer always goes May I speak to Starsky He says his name
See that 's what I 'm saying It has the logic of a dream
As part of his plan I do n't know why
Why
No It 's a real episode The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones
I think you might of dreamed this one Anthony
He 's not there Huggie Bear is n't in every single episode
Plus where 's Huggie Bear
Dignan it 's
OK That 's wrong
Right The blond guy
Making Hutch David Soul
Black hair Paul Michael Glaser
What color hair does he have
HENRY Because I was like you once And there was no one there to help me
Why 'd you want to help us
HENRY Absolutely
Can I ask you something Mr Henry
HENRY We 're renegades from despair
HENRY It 's an esoteric journey
Yeah
HENRY But you 're thieves It 's what you are
HENRY I want to ask a favor boys One day when I 'm long gone and all but forgotten make one last toast to Abe Henry And remember me as a friend
This is good
HENRY Anthony I 'm petrified
Are you afraid to die Mr Henry
HENRY Bob Bob That 's a palindrome I love palindromes
No Bob did
HENRY The fear of death The pain of consciousness Did you mix this martini
Death
HENRY Exactly Woah
Yeah I mean I do n't think about it all the time But once in awhile I kind of go Woah Man
HENRY Are you afraid
I do n't want to die
HENRY No that door over there
Me
HENRY I 'll tell you Anthony Times like this I get philosophical What does it mean What 's it all about Are you afraid to die
That sounds like Dignan
HENRY Well he agreed 100 that Bob should be dropped And he also agreed you were a liability But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses
How 'd he do
HENRY Yes he did

HENRY Congratulations You passed the test
HENRY Hold it

HENRY As far as I can tell he has n't thought his life through He 'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car But business You I can work with You I could groom Dignan 's not going to make it
I do n't think you 're giving him enough credit I know sometimes he does n't think an idea through He gets too excited But
HENRY Sure sure He 's a great person and I 'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here
What do you mean what kind of person He 's a good person
HENRY I guess what I 'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan
I 'm not really sure I think it 's Irish Or maybe
HENRY Tell me something What the hell kind of name is Dignan
So do I
HENRY Look at that woman She 's what Fifty Fifty-five But she has n't let herself go I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body

Jesus Christ No
Was Future Man adopted
No I was n't adopted
Well because you guys do n't look alike
Why do you say that
Were you adopted Bob
Yeah but he still has the aggravation Three days sitting in a cell
I thought he did n't have to pay anything because of the technicality
Prison tatoos I got to be pretty good It 's not like drawing on paper
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary
Yeah One minute you 're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you 're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend
Sixty days
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter That 's partly why I was in custody so long Sixty days
I do n't like that word prank Bob I was trying to do something more than a prank
That 's pretty complicated for a senior prank
It took six months of research I did all the wiring myself Switched AC to DC Doubled the voltage Shorted out the generator The whole school was shut down
Well I did n't mean to electrocute him But the whole operation was my idea
I know it must of been a bad experience But it does n't sound like it was your fault
No I do n't mind
You do n't have to talk about it if you do n't want to
Yes You just got to stick with it
You think I 'm improving
You 've only been playing for two weeks Bob It takes a long time to learn this game
Cause I 'm not getting any better It 's a waste of time
Why not
I 'm not playing any more golf
Bob where you going
Is that OK
What
And if Future Man does n't get let out of jail in 48 hours then we go back All right
Anthony I
I do n't know I do n't know anything Except Phil says they got him And he 's in jail
How long are they going to hold him
He looked too shaken-up
You think he got my license plates
OK Dad
Will you guys shut up God It 's like having two little kids in the car
Nobody does
I do n't know I personally do n't need that shit in my life right now
Why do n't you just tell them the truth Those belong to my neighbor Phil
Move
Where you going
Phil probably provoked him Where 's he going
I hope not
Oh yeah They 'll never catch the guy
There 's a million places to hide around here
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop He loves them
What was that
You 'll probably have them the rest of your life
See you Bob
See you
Yeah He said that
Are you serious
Let them fight
Let them fight
You could make your own cinnamon toast
I do n't know Sure I guess
Could you grow cinnamon
But he 's got a loud bark That 's the most important thing is a loud bark
Hector woud n't do anything
It 's private property Plus I have Hector
In your backyard How do you protect them
Pot is an herb It 's just like any type of gardening

You 're Anthony
Nice to meet you Applejack
Bob Get back in position
What
True
You do n't celebrate til it 's over
Well this is n't really a party per se
I do n't know why the fuck we 're having a party The damn job 's not over yet
Hell no This is a '72 I was driving a '63 Pontiac
Mr Henry pulled that job in 1965 It 's famous Applejack was the wheel man Did you use this same car Applejack
We 're going too slow It looks like we 're following him
Wait Did he see us
Looks like he 's staying with Buckethead That 's what I figured He 's probably got his own room Let 's see where he 's going
What 's he doing here
Yeah
That 's your friend Anthony
That 's Anthony
Wait a second
Is that him
Is that Buckethead
We might have to take that chance Cause I feel pretty strongly about this
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that 'll land us in jail
Just settling an old score You might say revenge
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car It does n't make any goddamn sense
There 's a lot of valuable shit in there Applejack The silver and the china The crystal And the grandfather clock Goddammit I bet that clock 's worth ten grand
The one and only Little Richard
RICHARD It seemed like a good idea at the time
Little Richard Trust me You 're insane Jesus this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets
RICHARD I do n't know about that
Dignan and Anthony this is Little Richard He 's crazy Totally nuts
RICHARD You 're the faggot
Are you a fag
Now
Wait a second
Here we go
Hold on
I do n't really want to talk about it Bob
Do they let you
No I have a cellmate His name 's Carl
Do you have your own cell
We do n't have rooms Bob We have cells
Do you have your own room
That 's just what the DA asked CRS is a disease where you ca n't remember shit
What 's that
I said to the DA That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease
Run Run Let 's go
Applejack drove
He 's stuck between two floors
Where 's Applejack
The elevator broke
Take him to the car Bob
I did n't think there was an alarm
Jesus Christ What the fuck is that
I think so
Is he breathing
Let 's go
He 's having a heart attack or something
What 's wrong with Applejack
Who 's watching the door What the fuck are you doing Get back in position
I could n't hear anything
Stand by Bird Dog
It looks pretty good There 's nobody back here
Yeah We 're in the elevator How 's it look back there
Everything OK
Yeah
Scarecrow
Jesus Christ
I know it man Hang on
Come on Bob
Look We want you on the job
That 's OK
That 's OK
I 'm sorry Bob
I did n't have any choice
It was n't your fault Bob You had your brother
I do n't want to fight you Dignan
Come on
All right Backyard Right now
Bullshit
Bob you 're lying
I never agreed to that
You said 48 hours
Man I do n't want to go into this
I ca n't fucking believe this guy An apology Bob
I do n't expect an apology and I do n't even want one I just want us to
Right It was extremely stupid
Yeah It is
It 's too bad about what happened on the road
Not a whole lot Bob
Come on in What you been up to
Not bad
Hey Dignan How 's it going
Anthony Bad news
Dignan
Let 's go
You 've got a beautiful walk Bob
That 's right I only have one vote We 'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out
It 's not your decision and he 's not your brother Dignan
OK Bob I do n't know his name You know why Because I do n't care He 's Future Man But I care about you And to me it does n't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime Will you get in the car Bob This is stupid
What 's his name
Just get in the car Bob
What is it
Yes I do
You do n't even know his name
I know it 's not
His name 's not Future Man Dignan
Future Man would never go to jail for you I 'll tell you that
Goddammit Dignan It 's my car If you do n't give me my keys I swear to God
Do n't threaten me Bob
Dignan You 're going to give me those keys or you 're going to get hurt
I ca n't do that Bob
Give me the keys Dignan
Good luck since I got the keys
Watch me
Not in that car you 're not
I 'm going back
Do n't Come on Dignan me
Come on Dignan
This could be a trap
Dignan he 's my brother I ca n't just leave him there
Bob that makes no sense
Well obviously we got to go back
What do you mean get back
We 'll have to see when we get back
Then how come they have n't set the bail yet That 's unconstitutional
I do n't know
How long has he been in there
I was just going to use it to see how much I had
So tell them the truth What do you use it for
The cops say it 's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house Everybody has a scale
They also found my two beam scale in the garage
That could be anybody 's
Well the marijuana crop is a good start
I do n't think they can make it stick Bob I mean what do they actually have on Future Man
They said he 's a drug dealer
But it 's not his How can they arrest Future Man
The weed
What are you talking about
My brother 's in jail
You can go first Bob
See you in a little while
Bob Are you coming
You 're the one who kept saying ram him
What the fuck possessed you
It 's registered in my mother 's name
I 'm sure he did We 'll have to get new plates
I do n't know
Is he chasing us
He would n't move
Shit Bob What the fuck did you do that for
There were more than that
In all probability nothing would of happened But why take the chance That 's why I ran I mean how many plants were even back there Five Ten
So it 's my fault
I told you they were there
Way to go Bob
Bob I 've got nightmares
That 's true That would give me nightmares
I mean Jesus Christ Bob You did n't have some vicious lunatic screaming I 'm going to remember you
I do n't want to talk about it
Bob will you please listen
No All he 'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose
You really think he 'll remember you
No I was calm
Was Dignan screaming like Get me a bag
Do n't count it
How much is there
Be cool Bob Be cool Make that light
Did we get it
That 's good Keep it at forty
This is natural
Shhh Slow down Bob Drive natural
What happened
I 'm putting a piece of tape on my nose
What are you doing
You know when somebody gets electrocuted their skin starts smoking At least Swifty 's did
That 's too bad
Yeah One of the nicest old guys you 'd ever know
His name was Swifty
It was an accidental I do n't want to go into the details It was just one of those senior pranks that did n't really go right I mean obviously since Swifty 's dead That 's why Anthony never graduated
He electrocuted someone
You know Bob Anthony did kill someone He electrocuted our janitor senior year
Yeah but what if some nut pulled gun on you
Well in reality it 's not that dangerous Bob It 's only dangerous if you do n't know what you 're doing
He does n't get it Held never understand what we 're trying to accomplish here It 's too dangerous for him
God DAMMIT
I paid for it
I just want to see how much bullets it takes
What 's your fucking problem You 're a shithead
I 'm paying attention I just want to look at it for a minute
Bob
OK
That 's your domain
That 's my responsibility
Hang on This is important Bob Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation The money and the people You 're responsible for the external situation The streets and the getaway
I 'm going to take a look at this
Let 's just go
I think we might of scared her
Maybe she turned
Where 'd she go
I do blame you Bob And woah Look at her
Well do n't blame me I told you
I know that now He 's a fucking psycho
No I was saying crazy like a lunatic
You said it like it was a big joke Bob Like he 's wild
I warned you Dignan
The guy is fucking insane
I told you he 's crazy
What did I say
I ca n't believe you said that
What was that all about
Yeah but do n't tell anybody
You 're paranoid Bob
Do n't you guys tell anybody about my plants
Good question
If it 's that easy why does n't everybody grow them
You should take a look I have an entire crop in my backyard
Six thousand dollars Come on Bob
As much as I want When these plants bud I 'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
How much could you grow Realistically
I 'll just drive my car
Well What do you want to do You want to steal one or just drive your car
It 's true Dignan
OK Bob
Yes I did
You stole a Trans-Am
Can you use a coaster
What are you talking about Bob
If you 're that worried maybe we should just steal one
Let 's cut the bullshit
That never would of
He looks like he was designed by scientists For desert warfare
My brother
So who 's going to know
They are
I thought your parents were in Italy
No
Not even for emergencies
I 'm not allowed to drive those
I do n't know Bob What about one of those

MAN John Mapplethorpe How are you Hi
Bourne comes here Why
He left yesterday on the night train He 's probably just getting in now You 'll have to hurry
What
Save it for Bourne
Go to the airport Get a plane I 'll have a brass band waiting for you
What do you mean
Leaving was a business decision We 're both rich come enjoy it
One last push One
Neski was a roadblock Without me there 's no company no fortune You owe me Uri One last push
Anything else
She 's done everything I wanted She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable She even found his bogus Swiss account
And the Landy woman
No The files are spotless Whatever they find it 's just going to make Conklin look worse
Will it track back to us
I 'll say You killed his goddam girlfriend instead Now they 're onto Neski They 're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak
There was a mistake
You told me Bourne was dead
Well you 're probably right I guess that 's all that hubris is
No You lost your way
In the end honestly it 's hubris Simple hubris You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are
No good options left
Had to be done
And Danny Zorn what was that
Why not It was just money
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it
I 'm not a traitor I 've served my ountry
'Why would be enough for me
I do n't exactly know what to say I 'm sorry
I 'd rather stand if it 's all the same to you
Sit down
I 'm sorry Ward
Jesus I Zorn I have to call his family Tell them
Do n't know
Moscow What the Hell 's he going to Moscow for
No It must have been Bourne
Did he say anything to you
Oh God It must have been Bourne
They found Danny Zorn 's body Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time
What
I was n't sleeping You OK
Sorry to wake you
Well whatever he 's doing I 've had enough this is now a search and destroy mission I want the Berlin police fully briefed and get this out to all the agencies
It 's hard to swallow The confusion the amnesia but he keeps on killing It 's more calculated than sick What about Nicky She 's the last one to see Bourne in Paris She 's the one he asks for They disappear
So what 's he doing You believe him
There are no answers There 's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead And I for one would prefer the latter And what about her You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection
Do n't you want answers
My ass he does You 're playing with fire Pamela Marshall said nail him to the wall I do n't know how you interpreted that but I do n't think he meant repatriate him
Hold on he said he wants to come in
Call a Mayday into Berlin station We need snipers DOD whatever they got Snipers
And you do From the moment he left Treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him
You do n't know what you 're getting into here
I 've already got a team there I doubt Bourne 's in Naples to settle down and raise a family
Berlin
So what 's your theory Conklin 's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name The man is dead
What 's definitive is that I just lost two people in Berlin
Conklin might 've been a nut but he was n't a mole You have me his calendar for a couple of days I 'll prove he killed Lincoln This is supposed to be definitive
May I finish
We were throwing money at him Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark
Excuse me
Do you know what his budget was
At the time of his death Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars
this is Conklin 's computer
Ivan Mevedev senior financial manager worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies Pecos Oil He claimed to know where the money landed We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency This
I think I do We had a deal going down in Berlin last week During the buy both our Field Agent and the seller were killed We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that did n't go off They were killed by Jason Bourne
Dead in a ditch Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu Who knows
And Bourne Where 's he now
I 've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency I 've shoveled shit on four continents I 'm due to retire next year and believe me I need my pension but if you think I 'm gon na sit here and let you dangle me with this you can go to hell Marshall too It had to be done
So you had Conklin killed I mean if we 're cutting the crap
What happened Jason Bourne happened You 've got the files Then let 's cut the crap It went wrong Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap Bourne was his number one guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back Conklin could n't fix it could n't find Bourne could n't adjust It all went sideways Finally there were no options left
I want to know what happened
What are you after Pam You want to fry me You want my desk Is that it
Let 's talk about Conklin
He does I 've been down to the archives I have the files Ward
To know about it It was a kill squad Black on black Closed down two years ago Nobody wants to know about Treadstone Not around here You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you 're doing
I want to know about Treadstone
And what are we looking for
With all due respect Pam I think you might 've wandered a little past your pay-grade
That 's not gon na fly
Never heard of it
Treadstone
Okay
Show me again
Nobody You I had to tell you right
Who else knows about this
Including Landy She had access to the archives
Lots of people
Something 's been going on here in Europe And it 's still going on Post Conklin Who 's been in Berlin
Keep going
Okay What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne What if Bourne did n't have anything to do with this
Jesus
Is it a slam dunk No but
It was staged
There were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously The second one the one that did n't go off was down here First of all this is nothing it 's a sub-line for the breaker above Second why put the charge all the way down here If you 're good enough to get in here and handle the gear you 're good enough to know you do n't need this Bourne would know
And
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it 's gon na take out power to the building You know that What you ca n't know is if it 's gon na blow the room with it
What do you have Danny
I did my box work but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense I mean I 'm with you on this Conklin was a nut but a traitor I just ca n't get there
The sooner the better
She say what time I should call
Thanks
Sir
I 'm sorry
Is this really happening
I have to go now
No Because you do n't want to know how it feels
Because you 're afraid
I ca n't let you do that either
I should kill you if it 's true you should die I should kill you now
Look at me
YOU 'RE A LIAR
You know I 'm not
You 're a liar
It does n't matter Your life is hard enough
I do n't want you to forgive me
How how can how can you be here and say this
They loved you And I killed them
You killed them
It was my job My first time Your father was supposed to be alone But then your mother she came out of nowhere I had to change my plan You understand me You do n't have to live like that anymore Thinking that
I killed them
Then what
That 's not what happened to your parents
Yes
It changes things That knowledge Does n't it
What
I would want to know I would want to know that my mother did n't kill my father I would want to know that she did n't kill herself
No I do
No It 's because you do n't know how they died
It 's nothing It 's just a picture
It 's nice Does this picture mean anything to you Hmm
Okay
Of all the people in the world you 're the only one I have anything to offer That 's why I came here
I speak English
Sit Can you The chair Have the chair

How long How long do I have
I 'm sorry
You called it in
I did
She really did that Told you not to kill me I had a woman once But after a while what do you talk about I mean for us The work You ca n't tell them who you are
I do n't know Why would I lie
What 's going on in Berlin
I do n't know who that is
Pamela Landy
A voice A voice from the States Someone new
Who sent you to Greece
I do n't know
You 're lying If it 's over why are they after me
Shot dead in Paris Dead the night you walked out
Try again
He 's dead
Conklin
What do you want
She would n't let me She 's the only reason you 're alive
So why did n't you kill me then
I like it here Last time I saw you was Greece You had a good spot
You still should 've moved
Sorry Old habits
Front Use your teeth
Drop it
Felt a little light
I emptied it
Jason You know exactly what to do That is your mission now
God I miss you I do n't know what to do without you
I only dream about people who are dead
You do
I know it 's a dream
It might have
It would n't have changed the way you feel
I did
But you found another choice
I wanted to kill him
Tell me later
I love you too
There 's no choice
Jason please do n't do this it wo n't ever be over like this
I warned them Marie I told them to leave us alone

Sleep Sleep now
I do n't mean that I worry when you try to ignore it
It 's just a nightmare
I worry when you get like this
I 'm trying Marie Okay
I do remember something good All the time I remember you
We write them down because sooner or later you 're going to remember something good
it 's always bad and it 's never anything but bits and pieces anyway You ever think that maybe it 's just making it worse You do n't wonder that
it has n't been two years
Two years we 're scribbling in a notebook
You 're sure We should still we should write it down
No There 's nothing new
I 'll get the book
Conklin up front
Where were you Jason In the car
it 's not in the file I swear I know your file your first job was Geneva I swear to God you never worked here
I was here
No Jason please
You never worked Berlin
That 's a lie
Your first assignment was Geneva
My first job
No You never worked Berlin
For Treadstone In Berlin You know my file I did a job here When
What do you mean
So when was I here
He closed down Treadstone he took care of me after Paris
Abbott
Please I 'm only here because of Paris because they ca n't figure out what you 're doing I 'm here because of Abbott
Why are you here then
Conklin Stuff on Conklin
What was Landy buying What kind of files WHAT WAS SHE BUYING
I left a fingerprint You fucking people
You left a print There was Kel that did n't go off There was a partial print they tracked it back to Treadstone They know it 's you
I killed him
And you got to him before we could
Last week When
It was Pamela Landy 's op The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something I have n't been debriefed on exactly what it was
A Russian
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national
Say it
I want to hear it from you
What is this a game
How do they know that How can they know any of that
They know They know you were here They know you killed these two guys They know you and Conklin had something on the side They do n't know what it is but they know
Why is she trying to kill me
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE
You hear me I believed you
Who is Pamela Landy
I did Jason I swear I did I told them I told them I believed you
Get on it
Yes
See that tram coming around the corner
Why you 're alive You 're alive because you 're special Because she kept you alive Because we want you back on our side
You did n't answer my question
Sounds like a threat
Do n't need it I remember everything
Do you think you can read Are you well enough
What 's that
Thank you for your gift I 'm sorry about Marie
Are you disappointed
Why am I alive
Careful
Oh shit
Ramstein Air Base Germany Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital
Where am I
Alexanderplatz 30 minutes Under the World Clock Alone Give her your phone
Okay Jason your move
There was a girl in Paris Part of the program She used to handle the medication
Who
I want someone I know to take me in
Okay how do you want to do it
I want to come in
What do you want
Bourne
It 's me
Hold on Yep And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room
What The tapes
You 're sure
But we can relax We tracked him He 's on a train to Moscow
We 'll know for sure when we get the security tapes
This stays between you and I We finally have an edge I do n't want to lose it
What
Alright take it down
I want to look at the room Check it out
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night
the hotel how far
go take the van
uplink all relevant files to Kim and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone
Kurt 's reopening all the wyfi and sat links
Then get a number they need to know who they 're dealing with
There 's only a Consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago
Who 's going Us
Looks like he 's been detained
And the Germans ca n't match it
so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines One of them failed The fingerprint That 's from the one that did n't go off
I 'm working on it
We need to get in there
shut up just shut the
no not me no other people
who who else is here
Is there Is all there
This is everything Is there
Now Show now
Here
Show me
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business That Bourne is still involved And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he 's been hiding to kill again How 's that scan
Okay cut to the chase Pam What are you selling
For a thief A mole I vetted the source Marty He 's real If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects it 's a bargain at ten times the price
Still
We 're talking raw unprocessed KGB files It 's not something we can go out and comparison shop
It 's a lot of money Pam
That 's where we came out
I 'm here So is Donnie and Jack Weller We understand you 're using the full allocation for this buy
I 'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes which means you are going to call me back in 30 and when I ask you where we stand I had better be impressed My mobile number is
Yes sir ma'am
I want that area secured I want any evidence secured and I want it done now Is that clear
If you ever want to make it to five you 're gon na listen to me real close Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous A week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer
Me Four years
How long have you worked for the agency
Pamela Landy again Where do we stand
Who 's this
Mr Nevins
Felt promising It 's a start
So
Let 's give him half an hour
Alright
I do n't know He was sick He wanted out I believed him
What do you think Is he coming in
It 's got caffeine in it That 's all I know
Is it fresh
Because he 's doing just what he said he 'd do He 's coming for us
And why is that
I do n't think we need to keep looking for him anyway
See that 's a problem for me Nicky Whatever he 's doing we need to end it This is n't the kind of mess you walk away from
What do you want from me I was reassigned I 'm out
Some women like Dobermans
These were killers Conklin had them all jacked up They were Dobermans
Did you
You mean did I want a date
You felt nothing No spark Two young people in Paris Dangerous missions Life and death
You 're making it out like we 're friends here or something I met him alone twice
Not good enough You 're the person who floated this amnesia story Ever feel sorry for him For what he 'd been through
If you say so
So he fooled you
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown
Believed what
Look what do you want me to say I was there I believed him
Are you an expert in amnesia
Am I a doctor no but
I 'm curious about Bourne Your interpretation of his condition You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions
You were his local contact You were with him the night Conklin died You 're coming with us
Good luck
Before this Before Bourne No
Amnesia
Depression Anger Compulsive behaviors They had physical symptoms headaches sensitivity to light
What kind of problems
And what about you anything
Yes In that order
Are we hacking or asking
We 're looking at all Berlin outbound Good news is every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed digital security cameras Common feed
Alright I want you Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne track everything that 's out there
His wife In room 645 Then she shot herself
By who
Here 's what I 've got Remember Vladimir Neski Russian politician Seven years ago he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel He never did He was murdered
Yeah that 'll work What the hell was he doing here
Black coat possibly leather Dark slacks Dark t-shirt He says they 're gon na try and corral the guests on the street over there and then check them out but
Are we locked up
No Munich 's a bust He 's loose
Anything
What the hell is a Treadstone
Yup The main word there the file heading translates as Treadstone
Do we know what this says
They 've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God 's church and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation So please do it
Then we 'll just have a peek at the wounds Dig 'em up
My brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over
What it means in England and in Scotland too is that rebels have forfeited their lands We were ambushed last night But the Scots dragged their dead away
We just had a funeral is n't that what it means in England as well
Someone dead from this household
Saying goodbye in their own way in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
What are they doing
Non loquis Latinum You do n't speak Latin We have to fix that wo n't we Did he give the poetic benediction The Lord bless thee and keep thee Patris Benefactum et It was Malcolm 's favorite
It was in Latin sir
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection Or was it all about Judgment
Did n't want your father to die either did ya But it happened
I do n't want to leave
We 'll sleep here tonight You 'll come home with me We 'll let the house and the lands too plenty of willing neighbors
He has already agreed to come
I will meet you but only one way if Robert the Bruce is there and puts his hand on my Bible and swears his loyalty to Scotland
We can not Some scarcely believe you are alive Other think you 'll pay them Mornay 's wages We bid you to Edinburgh Meet us at the city gates two days from now at sunset Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you Scotland will be one
So let the council swear publicly
An oath to a liar is no oath at all An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you
You 've all sworn to Longshanks
Sir William We come to seek a meeting
It is suicide
With cavalry not heavy like the English but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen
We can not defeat this
Peace
We must sue for peace
A thousand You have made me Guardian of Scotland So I tell you this is what we face
Invade That 's impossible it
I will invade England And defeat the English on their own ground
But what will you do
You are surprised he would lie Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday You are Longshanks new designate You will be king
Longshanks promised
He will I know he will
He wo n't come
That is another matter There is a price to all this required both by Longshanks and our nobles Pay it and you will be our king And we will have peace
The crown is that of Scotland And Scotland is William Wallace
Homage is nothing It is the crown that matters
If I pay homage to another 's throne then how am I a king
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone and his crowns divided for others to wear
He was a modest man
May he rest in peace You have already sealed the coffin
No But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything The Balliols will kiss his ass so we must
Does anyone know his politics
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride But he sends his greetings and says that I speak for all the Bruces And for Scotland
A wise plan And how is your father We have missed him at the council
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes
Young Robert we are honored
You let Wallace escape your whole army You can not blame me for this
His legend grows It will be worse than before
He is gone Finished Dead If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him he will not survive the winter It is very cold is it not our flower
But if we have not caught Wallace
What choice do they have Now they must serve us or starve
The Scots will fight for us
Now we kill two birds at one stroke We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France
So the Scots will have none of them will they My armorers have already made a thousand
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself
Impossible How dare you bring a panicky lie
Wallace has sacked York
I have ordered conscriptions
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost our entire northern army wiped out And you have done nothing
Nothing new Majesty We have sent riders to speed any word
What news of the north
I hear This Wallace is a bandit nothing more
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms
Before he lost his powers of speech he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead
Nor you To you that word is as unfamiliar as love
I respect him At worst he was a worthy enemy Show mercy Oh thou great king and win the respect of your own people
You fancy him
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace
Wallace 's For treason there is no trial Tomorrow he will be charged then executed
When will his trial be
Simply because he eluded your trap do you think he is more than a man My father is dying Perhaps you should think of our coronation
Is it true Wallace is captured
Grant as you do everything else with treachery Offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary He trusts me Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along And I will set the meeting and the ambush
The little cow is insane
Wallace himself If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town I leave you to your hauntings If you wish to take him I know a way
Wallace 's followers
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
You mock us with a smile
Good day to you M'Lords
You may
Yes I had thought that I was loathsome to you Perhaps I am If I may be excused M'lord
Now my flower do you understand
Look at me I said LOOK AT ME
No M'lord
All so very boring He wants me to learn to fight too so let me do it
His majesty was quite keen that you should understand
Shut up would you How can I concentrate
Scotland He intends
So I did And what was so important about it
You directed me to report to you the moment the king 's conference was ended
What is it
No One of us is enough
Keep these We 're going too
My dreams of Marion are gone I killed them myself If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death I 'd welcome it
Your dreams are n't about freedom They 're about Marion You have to be a hero because you think she sees you Is that it
We 've lived a dream together A dream of freedom
That 's just a dream William
Nor I I want to live I want a home and children and peace I 've asked god for those things But He 's brought me this sword And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country then I 'll do that too
I do n't want to be a martyr
Probably But we ca n't win alone We know that This is the only way
You know it 's a trap
Your rest is making me exhausted
I rest
Rest William
We 're here to stay We do n't care to live if we ca n't fight beside ya
Thanks for the food and drink And for bringing 'em yourselves
Aye
Stephen ready
Mornay has come So will the Bruce
The Bruce is not coming William
Fourteen
We make spears A hundred spears Fourteen feet long
Hamish I thank
I 'll wait back there
I should a remembered the eggs
Good to see you again
I will not
You 'll move
I could crush you like a roach
Can you do it when it matters As it matters in battle Could you crush a man with that throw
That depends on the man
I still say this is no test A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can
The test of a soldier is not in his arm It 's here
Call it a test of soldiery then The English wo n't let us train with weapons so we train with stones
You win
Test of manhood
Aye we 'll get 'em
We 'll get those English pigs tomorrow
I wan na have supper waitin
Wan na stay with me tonight
It 's up to us Hamish
With your father and brother gone they 'll kill us and burn the farm
They 're English soldiers ai n't they
Armed
Three maybe more
How many
They 're coming
They used hounds on us in Ireland it 's the only way
We do n't split up
We must run in different directions
A patriot
A common thief
Excellent Stephen is my name I 'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle Except I 'm not on the Emerald Isle of course more 's the pity
In order to find his equal and Irishman is forced to talk to God Yes Father The Almighty says do n't change the subject just answer the fookin question
Is your Poppa a ghost or do you converse with God Almighty
All right Father I 'll ask him If I risk my neck for you will I get a chance to kill Englishmen
All men lose heart All betray It is exactly why we must make the choices we make
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break
We must have alliance with England to prevail here You achieved that You saved your family increased your lands In time you will have all the power in Scotland Yet you grieve
He broke because of me I saw it He lost all will to fight
So more men were slaughtered uselessly
He was so brave With courage alone he nearly won
I am the one who is rotting But I think your face looks graver than mine
He will fight you forever But what does he fight for Freedom first and peace So grant them
Let her speak
I have faced him Have you
My greatness is better demonstrated with this
Forgive me Sire I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule
This is what happens when you must send a woman And a fool
No I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war
Humbly M'lord
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support His army starves Our stall has worked he must withdraw You may return to your embroidery
A mindless barbarian Not a king like you M'lord
You spoke with this Wallace in private What kind of man is he
He waits For you He says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him
Then why does he stay My scouts say he has not advanced
No He did not
My son 's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen So he accepted our bribe
If he wants his queen to rule then you stay and learn how I will deal with him
Shall I leave M'lord
I sent for him and the little coward send you
Your pardon M'lord he asked me to come in his stead
Where is my son
Then on the morrow thou shalt receive they purification And in the end I promise you 'll beg for the axe
I do not confess
Confess and you may receive a quick death Deny and you must be purified by pain Do you confess DO YOU CONFESS
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times I can not commit treason if I have never been his subject
It matters not he is thy king
Never in my whole life did I swear allegiance to your king
Against thy king thou vile fool Hast thou anything to say
Treason Against whom
Tonight
Then when
My parents are growing suspicious I ca n't keep meeting you every night
Tonight then
Shush It 's only been a day And it 's seemed like forever
I 've missed you
I will be with you like this Forever
This night is too beautiful to have again
I do n't want to scare you I want to be yours and you mine Every night like this one
You scare me
But I wo n't give you up to any nobleman
Nor I
I 'm not just saying it
I accept your proposal
I want to marry you
No You do n't choose your dreams Your dreams choose you
Did it work
Some nights I have dreams Mostly dreams I do n't want I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I 'd dream only of the ride and the adventure
You 've been here before
You are And I 'll come again
I 'll invite you again but your mother thinks I 'm crazy
Thank you for inviting
Thank you for accepting
It 's not you He dislikes that you 're a Wallace He just says the Wallaces do n't seem to live for very long
Your father does n't like me does he
Wake up William Wake up
I need you so much I love you
And I with you But you must wake
I do n't want to wake I want to stay with you
Yes you are And you must wake
I 'm dreaming
I would n't know
Knowing his passion for his lost love they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place Now that is romance Oui
A magistrate wished to capture him and found he had a secret lover so he cut the girl 's throat to tempt Wallace to fight and fight he did
This Scottish rebel Wallace He fights to avenge a woman
Ah Oui Englishmen do n't know what a tongue is for
He should n't be telling secrets in bed
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council
How do you know this
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes Scotland is in chaos Your husband is secretly sending an army north
I ca n't bear the thought of your torture Take it
It will numb my wits and I must have them all If I 'm senseless or if I wail then Longshanks will have broken me
Drink this It will dull your pain
Every man dies Not every man really lives
You will die It will be awful
If I swear to him then everything I am is dead already
Mercy is to die quickly Perhaps even live in the Tower In time who knows what can happen if you can only live
Will he show mercy to my country Will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves
Sir I come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy
M'lady what kindness of you to visit a stranger
No But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost Or simply love me because I love you
I can not love you for the sake of revenge
You understand Consider before you laugh and say no You will never own a throne though you deserve one But just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule England And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks but with that of a true king
I have taken vows More than one I 've vowed faithfulness to my husband and sworn to give him a son And I can not keep both promises
You have you have a husband
Because of the way you 're looking at me now The same way as when we met
Why did you
It does me good to see you
A meeting in a barn It had to be a trap And only you would know I would be aware of it
She was my wife We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord They killed her to get to me And she was pregnant
I understand you have suffered I know about your woman
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS
Peace is made is such ways
A Lordship And gold That I should become Judas
Let us talk plainly You invade England But you can not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply The King proposes that you withdraw your attack In return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which I am to pay to you personally
That is not possible
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots even women and children from the city walls
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities The executioner of the king 's nephew my husband 's own cousin
I have been given nothing God makes men what they are
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight
But now that I am here will you speak with a woman
It 's battle I want not talk
I come as the king 's servant and with his authority
Wife of Edward the king 's son
I am the Princess of Wales
And I will consult with mine
I must consult with my father
Then tell me what a king is Is he a man who believes only what others believe Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart There is strength in you I see it I know it
I am trying
War finds me willing I know it wo n't bring back all I have lost But it can bring what none of us have ever had a country of our own For that we need a king We need you
Nobles What does that mean to be noble Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country But men do n't follow titles they follow courage Your arm speaks louder than your tongue Our people know you Noble and common they respect you If you would lead them toward freedom they would follow you And so would I
I 'm no coward I want what you want But we need the nobles
We all end up dead It 's only a question of how And why
No But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other If you make enemies on both sides of the border you 'll end up dead
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield does he risk less
Wait I respect what you said But remember these men have lands castles Much to risk
Aye But it wo n't let me dream
Come it 'll help you sleep
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field
Fine speech Now what do we do
No English lord would trust an Irishman
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger
Exactly
Who would do such a thing
The dogs have a scent My scent Someone must have given it to them
What 's the crazy man saying Lord
They 've tricked us
We ca n't stop
BOSWELL When I asked Evan about his drawing well he did n't remember doing it
What
BOSWELL Of course There is one more thing Mrs Treborn And I feel bad for mentioning it
Thank you for showing it to me first I 'll I 'll take care of it Can I have the picture
BOSWELL Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up Most of them made drawings of what their parents did but this
What is it
BOSWELL I was going to show this to the principal but I wanted to talk to you first
I 'm sorry but can it wait til tonight I 'm already late for work
BOSWELL Mrs Treborn I need to speak with you
REDFIELD The hemorrhaging the neural damage is irreparable I 'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
No dances just tell me
So what did you find
REDFIELD Actually these tests were n't available twenty years ago
REDFIELD Nine ten And you 're awake Open your eyes dammit
Evan wake up oh please wake up
How soon
REDFIELD It 's worth a shot I can arrange a controlled meeting A careful dose of sedatives for Jason some security you and I monitoring Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex
Well he has been pushing me to meet his father but I 've been putting it off
REDFIELD You 'd be surprised how often they are
Come on I doubt the answer 's that simple
REDFIELD Plenty Who knows Maybe he 's got severe coping problems about not having a father Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend 's dad
But he 's seven What kind of stress can he have
REDFIELD If I had to guess I 'd say the blackouts are stress related
But you must have something to go on
REDFIELD Unfortunately we 've got nothing to work with It 's harder playing detective now
And the bad news
REDFIELD Well the good news is that the results are negative I 've found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors
REDFIELD It could be extremely useful to jog his memory See if he remembers anything new the next day And I 'll have the test results back in a few days
Why What for
REDFIELD A journal Just have him write down everything he does
Anything
REDFIELD Look Andrea I 'm sure he 'll test negative for brain disorders But there 's something else you can try to monitor his memory
Just tell me that Evan does n't have Jason 's illness
REDFIELD Hold it hold it Andrea Let 's not jump to conclusions I 'll run some preliminary tests see what we can rule out
Not according to his teacher It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan 's inherited his father 's condition
REDFIELD And you say he does n't remember any of it
Do n't worry I 'm gon na get you out of here
Just Like Jason
You told me that on Parents Weekend Remember Wait that was n't me Or you
How Did you Know that
Come on Mom Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy does n't mean that I 'm nuts
You 're Acting Like your father
I just need the entry about the blockbuster Wait shit no arms I never even got the chance to write it
Fix
There must be a way to fix this
He 's saying it 's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year Overload city 'Sat about the gist of it doc
What does that mean for Evan
Cute Evan
Okay doc What 's the damage How much time have I got
Fine You 'll get them Evan But I think it 's far more important to focus on your case right now
Damn it Mom I told you I need them all
I found these The others are still in storage
How 's Kayleigh doing She all right
I do n't know These things take time
How long will I be in here
I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal He 's sure he can get you off on self-defense so if you 're patient
What What could he do
And then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could
Sure
I could n't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms You know he might only have thought he actually remembered them
When he was around your age almost exactly your age He said he figured out a trick to remember the past
No it 's just weird with him being such a brain and all I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he 'd forgotten
Why do you ask
Ma Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time
Please He got straight A 's without ever touching a book That was the one area where his memory never failed him
Did Da Jason get good grades
I ca n't help it I 'm just so proud of you You 've got the highest grades in all of your classes
Please mom People will talk
Do n't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
I I blacked out
Something must 've happened What set him off
I do n't know I do n't remember
Okay
Now your father may seem sleepy to you but that 's just because of his medicine okay
I I do n't remember
Honey What were you doing with that
What happened
Great I 'll see you soon
These 'll bring you luck Crockett
My father has a bad memory too
That 's why I wanted you to come here Evan Dr Redfield already has a background in memory loss
You 'll be fine Dr Redfield just wants to give you some tests You 'll like him
I do n't like this place Mom It 's creepy Please can we go I promise I wo n't make any more bad pictures
Good Because I 've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I 'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there
No
I get the point kiddo But I 'm not so bad am I
All the dads are gon na be there
But Lenny said that his dad 's coming and Tommy and Kayleigh 's dad
We 've been over this a hundred times It 's too dangerous for him
Ca n't he come out for one day
You know the answer to that
Um can dad come this time
Darn it
Thanks Do n't worry Evan you 'll have plenty of time
Righty-tighty lefty-lucy
We 're putting up pictures for Parent 's Night
When did you ever care about getting to school on time
We 're gon na be late again
So you believe me
Signs of the Lord They just appeared out of nowhere I thought you were loco
What did you see What did it look like
Marks scars I dunno Anything could happen I guess
Weirder than this
Just tell me if anything weird happens
You need to see the prison shrink man
So when I 'm out I need you to watch my face and hands closely
I ai n't bullshitting Jesus speaks to me in my dreams
Shit I knew you were crazy
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose For you to help me
Straight up
You 're religious Carlos you believe that bit about the Lord works in mysterious ways
Jesus himself could n't make me take on the Brotherhood When they come just put your mind in another place man Be somewhere else
Can you protect me
Best not bitch up Wind up someone 's luggage that way
Photos
REDFIELD You remind me of your father He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
But I I need those books
REDFIELD Think Evan You 've invented a disease that does n't exist Alternate universes with colleges prisons paraplegia
My journals Where are they
REDFIELD Books
Where are my goddamn books
REDFIELD Hey Evan What 's the big rush We do n't meet for another hour
Lem me guess Would that be where the memories are stored
REDFIELD This is where we 're finding most of the hemorrhaging The outer lining of the cerebral cortex
Are you sure Not even with my father
REDFIELD It 's a little complicated I have n't seen results exactly like these before
It 's coming argh I ca n't
REDFIELD The car does n't vanish Evan The movie in your head has broken that 's all But now I 've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car
I ca n't the car vanishes and all of a sudden I 'm on the ground in the woods
REDFIELD Go on Nothing can hurt you Remember this is only a movie You 're completely safe
I see a car
REDFIELD Okay Then go a little forward in time What do you see now
No protecting her
REDFIELD Are you hurting her
I 'm standing next to Kayleigh my hands are over her ears
REDFIELD Where are you now
Yes
REDFIELD Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny Think of it like a movie You can pause rewind or slow down any details you wish Understand
REDFIELD Not in this wing actually No
Dad lives here
You know my father
REDFIELD Hello Evan It 's very nice to meet you He 's as handsome as his father
Sorry dude Just figured it 'd be okay with you bein sick and all
Get out Both of you
Fuck off frat boy
Huh
Whasamatter Lost your Rolex
Shucks I dunno But maybe there 's a reason why you 've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities dammit
What
Are you stupid or what
Shhh I need quiet for this
What the fuck are you doing
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr Miller took his shirt off
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
You really think he wanted to kill you
That 's probably why Hannibal Lecter 's so smart
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure it gets all of the worm 's memories
Like Ozzy
It 's an experiment with flatworms and a maze You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he 's memorized it Then you put a new flatworm in the maze He 's clueless Banging into walls getting lost whatever
This is bigger Seven years to the day No blackouts
I thought you were a December baby
Get dressed Thumper you 're taking me out for my birthday
Why not But that 's not how things wound up I 'm with Lenny Lenny 's your friend And there it ends
Then you think it might have worked out
Well a lot of things cross my mind I 've always been a fast thinker Ev I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second Boom we fall in love get married two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots the whole bit It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine
And
It 's crossed my mind from time to time
I never knew that So then you still sometimes think of us together
When my folks split they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with I could n't stand my dad but I knew if I moved to my mom 's I 'd never see you again
I do n't get it
That 's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother
I was
Sure Evan why not You were the first person I really ever cared about
Kayleigh Do you ever think about us I mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us
Yeah I think I got ta get these fixed or something
Is something the matter
He saved Mrs Halpern Please the twisted fuck
You know how spiritual he 's gotten ever since he saved Mrs Halpern and Katie
Stop Take me back
We have to get you to Sunnyvale You 're having one of your famous hemorrhages
Where are we going
Well do n't give up now Slick You 've already done so much for me Hell why do n't you go back in time and save Mrs Halpern and her baby Then maybe Lenny would n't freak out and ruin my family
I 'm over it Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit
Off to change everyone 's life again is that it Maybe this time you 'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act
Do n't think I 'll need it where I 'm going
Sure you do n't want your wallet
There is no fuckin way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin sorority
Which is
There 's one major hole in your story
That I did n't leave you there to rot
Know what
I just thought you should know
Then forget that How about you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you it reminds you of your step-sister
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that
Shit I dunno How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh
Oh There 's proof now
I could n't give a shit if you believe me or not and frankly I 'm too tired to prove it to you
I 'm the only person you 've told That 's a great line Does that make other girls swoon Do they actually eat up this bullshit
I never thought you would That 's why I 've never bothered to tell a soul until now and why I never will again
You 're right Evan I do n't believe you
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts
On the bridge How did you know that Tommy had your dog That was no fucking hunch
Yeah
Let me ask you a question Just a little one that 's been gnawing at me for years
Different How
Because you 're different
Why 's that
I 've seen some sickening shit I do n't blink twice anymore especially in your case
You would n't believe me I mean people always say You would n't believe me but in this case it 's not even worth trying
What 's happened to you
The bottom When you 're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack
Ha Where 's that
No Just that you need to hurt me with it I 've been where you 've been
Oh I 'm sorry Does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious
I get it You can drop it now
So how 's tricks Sorry occupational humor
Nice to see you too Can I come in
Oh I thought you were my eight o'clock Make it fast I 'm expecting someone
Now 's the only time Today you get a chance to redeem yourself Start over with a clean slate Tabula rasa
Evan Stop it It 's not the time
I want you to take this Lenny Today 's your day of atonement I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby
He 's a fucking maniac
Evan stop You 're gon na kill him
What
Wait Something 's not right Is n't that your jacket
I know I 've been actin strange lately It 's just that I do n't want anything to happen to us
I ca n't put my finger on it but everything 's a bit off Even the dinner tonight It was beautiful but
I walk differently
I do n't know You seem different You make weird jokes Your accents changed You do n't even walk the same
Like how
It 's just you 've been acting kinda strange you know
What do you mean
Are you okay
My father never laid a hand on me It 's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy
Do n't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit because you turned out fine
It 's not his fault Evan You knew how bad he had it when we were kids
Yeah right Tell that to Crockett
Please Evan Do n't even joke He would n't hurt you He 's just trying to scare you away from me
Might a been nice Like this is gon na do any good Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun
It 's my fault I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago
Simple math When I woke up this morning and saw your smile I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
Why are you doing all this for me
Go on Sit down
I do n't know what to say It 's beautiful
You 'll see
I do n't understand where are you taking me
As if my dad could 've stopped me from seeing you What 's he gon na do to me
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect Like looking back whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away
Yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird
So it did n't feel weird
Oh my God that was good Where 'd you learn all those new tricks
I dunno Just being weird
Well I remember he had one but he like put it away after the first day Why would that freak me out
Hey uh do n't go freaking out on me over this but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera
Those are your clothes silly
Where where are my clothes
Mmmm You give good compliment Clean up and come back to bed
Jesus Kayleigh you 're Incredible
Who are you trying to convince Evan You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything 's all better now Well fuck you Evan Nothing 's gon na be all better Okay Nothing ever gets better
You ca n't hate yourself just because your dad 's a twisted freak
Just shut up Evan You 're wasting your breath
No but I think something really bad might 've happened to us
Is that why you came all the way back To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood
I know but
It was a long time ago
It 's just did he what happened in the basement
What do you want to know Evan
When we were kids Your dad was making a movie Robin Hood or something
Well sure I 'll try to remember Shoot
Well lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I 'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular It 'd be a big help
Of course
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts
Me Are you kidding Why
Actually Kayleigh the reason I came back to town was to talk to you
She had a new family Not enough space for me Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids But whatever
Could n't you have moved in with your mom
Not if you remember my dad
Wow That must 've taken some courage
No I emancipated myself when I was fifteen
They kept him in juvy for a few years Now he works over at Dale 's Autobody
So how 's Tommy
I 've stopped a hundred times
Not since we were kids
I 'm going to State now Things are going okay I guess Mom 's good
No Evan I do n't know It 's been a long time Fill me in
Oh comme si comme ca you know
God Evan I never thought I 'd see you again How 've you been
Hi Lenny
Welcome home Thought you might like some fresh air for a change
He must be They 're letting him go right
Did your mom say if Lenny was okay
Duck here they come
He 's been acting real strange lately He wo n't even look me in the eyes anymore
I ca n't believe Tommy 's still pissed at me He knows I 'm moving away right
What are you talking about What you deserve is a better brother and father All they do is make you feel like shit
I deserve a lot worse
Damn Your dad did this
It 's not your fault Mrs Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny
I 'm sorry
Ouch
You really do n't remember anything that happened
I 'm sorry Kayleigh This was a bad idea
Shit Lenny What 's happened to you We 've got ta get help
Oh God what did we do
So let 's go This place creeps me out
We should go soon If Dad catches us smoking down here we 're dead
Been there done that
MILLER That 's dangerous You could blow your hands off
And I 'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors One step closer and I 'll shove this up your ass
MILLER Easy does it Evan Do n't be a bad boy or I 'll tell mommy you were naughty
Listen close then fuckbag You screw up again and I swear I 'll flat out castrate you
MILLER yes
Let 's just say you 're being closely watched George Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like oh let 's say like how a loving father treats his daughter Sound okay to you Papa
MILLER Who who are you
It 'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father Ultimately it 'll lead to her suicide Nice work daddy
MILLER What 's happened to How are you doing that
Wrong answer fuckbag This is the very moment of your reckoning In the next thirty seconds you 're going to open one of two doors The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood
MILLER It 's time for you to stand where the hell I told you
What time is it
Kayleigh What happened
MILLER Quit acting like some retard or I 'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you 've been
I was just somewhere else how did I get here
MILLER Calm down kid Stand still
Where am I What happened Where did we all go
MILLER That 's right Evan and you get to be the star
We 're really gon na be in a movie
Bullshit I 'll send you a postcard when I 've made everything perfect again
You ca n't play God son It must end with me Just by being here you may be killing your mother
Who 's to say you ca n't make things better
There is no right When you change who people are you destroy who they were
But it did n't And now I need info to make things right again and you 're the only one who can give it to me
I was praying this curse would have ended with me
Look Jason I need some fast answers if I 'm ever gon na fix what I 've done
Are you okay You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there
Uh-huh Mom says I have your eyes and your
It 's okay I wo n't bite You 've seen pictures of me right
I 'd say blow me Get the pledges to do it
Thanks Wow Hey I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers
Damn Evan on the D.L
You 're kidding Are these the answers
Me neither
We 'll find out soon enough
Evan you 're hysterical You study for this
CARTER The answer 's 'no Mr Treborn Now take a seat The exam 's about to begin
Evan Treborn
CARTER And you are
I still owe you an essay from last week Is there any way I could get an extension
CARTER Remember everyone Only two weeks until your science projects are due
I wo n't let you down Professor Carter
CARTER Just do n't drop the ball okay
CARTER I know I know Who can think of worms when your libido 's in full swing right
Oh fine I guess It 's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up so I have n't
CARTER Whoa Did n't mean to scare you Evan Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming
Hey I got no choice
CARTER Typical psych major A complete wise ass And how 's your project coming Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation
I 'm not sure I might have gotten some stories mixed up Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts
Maybe because they never do So Don Juan you pass out on all your dates
It did n't feel like a dream
It was like Tommy was possessed or something There was a hate in his eyes that I could n't really call human
Come on go on
Deal Now read me something
Freeze No worm-boy No Mr Worm and no Worm-Master-General Once you get a nickname like that you ca n't shake it And I do n't want everyone thinking I 've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something okay
Wow read something
Yeah I 've been keeping journals since I was seven
Most guys tuck their porn under here but all you have are comp books
You 're kidding He 's so big
Thumper had a busy afternoon
Smells like sex in here
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function it 'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain
So what 's the point
If I had n't blown my arms off Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place Now shhhh
Destroy it
Shhh I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I 'm gon na destroy it
What
Duly noted Now I 'm gon na ask you for one last favor
What do you need it for I do n't get you lately
My mom packed for me I think she sent everything I ever owned So we 'll see
Are you sure you even packed it
Forget it What 's the point of Psych now Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh
Uh we should be getting to class now
Y yes I guess I did
You knew the whole time did n't you When you put the blade in my hand you knew something big was going to happen Did n't you
Drop it or I 'll slit your mother 's throat in her sleep

I 'll do whatever you want You do n't want me to ever see Kayleigh again fine Just let Crockett go Besides you kill him now and they 'll stick you in juvy for sure And I know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father
Listen to me good Evan
Right Evan I believe you just said sick fuck

Here you go buddy
You 're such a retard
You put the mommy too far away Mrs Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wan na fix it
He 's just a lucky guy
Monsieur Rick I
Yes well everybody in Casablanca has problems Yours may work out You 'll excuse me
Oh but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe to get to America Oh but if Jan should find out He is such a boy In many ways I am so much older than he is
Go back to Bulgaria
Oh yes please
You want my advice
And he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart That would be all right would n't it
Nobody ever loved me that much
He always has
Will he keep his word
And you want to know
Yes Monsieur
And he is still willing to give you a visa
Oh yes
Does he know that
He tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
Yes I 'll bet
Yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult It was much more than we thought to get here And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind He wants to help us
So you decided to go to America
Eight weeks We come from Bulgaria Oh things are very bad there Monsieur A devil has the people by the throat So Jan and I we we do not want our children to grow up in such a country
How long have you been married
At the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa Well of course he 's losing
I thought so Where 's your husband
He did Captain Renault did
Now just a minute Who told you to ask me that
No I mean is he trustworthy Is his word
Oh he 's just like any other man only more so
Monsieur Rick what kind of man is Captain Renault
No
No of course not Do you mind if I do
He is Well Captain Renault 's getting broadminded Sit down Will you have a drink
My husband is with me too
I should have known
I came with Captain Renault
How did you get in here You 're under age
Could I speak to you for just a moment please
Yes
Monsieur Rick
But we who are still free will do all we can We are organized Monsieur underground like everywhere else Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois If you would come
I see
As you see it was true every single time Thank heaven I found you Berger I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte He is supposed to help me
We read five times that you were killed in five different places
In a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
I recognize you from the news photographs Monsieur Laszlo
A champagne cocktail please
Yes Monsieur
Mr Berger the ring could I see it again
I 'm sorry It is
Such a bargain But that is your decision
Berger Norwegian and at your service sir
What is your name
Good
Then perhaps for the lady The ring is quite unique
Thank you but I hardly think
You will find a market there for this ring I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
Well
Excuse me but you look like a couple who are on their way to America
Yes sir
I want you to take Miss Lund home
Yes I come I will do it
Tonight he forgot
But Sacha always puts out that light
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance It might attract the police
Yes I come
Come up here a minute
The police break up our meeting Herr Rick We escaped in the last moment
Goodnight Monsieur Rick
Goodnight
I wo n't
Do n't tell me where you 're going
I will Then I am going to the meeting of the
Now you finish locking up will you Carl
Oh thank you Herr Rick Sacha will be happy to hear it I owe him money
Maybe I wo n't have to A bribe has worked before In the meantime everybody stays on salary
Oh two weeks maybe three
How long can I afford to stay closed
Well you are in pretty good shape Herr Rick
Monsieur Rick
No thanks Carl
Monsieur Rick may I get you a cup of coffee
That 's all right
It shall not happen again Monsieur
Here you are
I 'm awfully sorry
Forget it Emil Mistakes like that happen all the time
I am so upset Monsieur Rick You know I ca n't understand
Well I 'll get it from the safe
Excuse me Monsieur Rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs The cashier would like some money
It has been a pleasure to meet you
Er goodbye sir
I have to warn you sir I beseech you
Er my check please
I 'd better be going
Er good luck yes
Here 's to you sir
I shall remember to pay it to myself
Do n't forget you owe Rick 's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes
Well so long
Of course they stay Rick 's would n't be Rick 's without them
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha they stay with the place or I do n't sell
Hmmm I happen to know that he gets ten percent But he 's worth twenty five
Oh by the way my agreement with Sam 's always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits That still goes
Ah to get out of Casablanca and go to America You 're a lucky man
It 's certainly not good enough But since I 'm in a hurry it 'll have to do
Shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
Rick do n't be a fool Take me into your confidence You need a partner
That 's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
Well you 're in good company Renault and Strasser probably think so too
Rick I 'll put my cards on the table I think you know where those letters are
I 'll tell him when he comes in
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters
And the carrying charges
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters I will handle the entire transaction get rid of the letters take all the risk for a small percentage
So could I And I 'm a poor businessman
If I could lay my hands on those letters I could make a fortune
Practically no one
Of course not What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are
You 're a fat hypocrite You do n't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do
The bourbon The news about Ugarte upset me very much
Carrying charges my boy carrying charges Here sit down There 's something I want to talk over with you anyhow
I never drink in the morning And every time you send my shipment over it 's always just a little bit short
No hurry I 'll have it sent over Have a drink with me
I see the bus is in I 'll take my shipment with me
My dear Rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy
Suppose we do
Suppose we ask Sam Maybe he 'd like to make a change
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine
That 's too bad That 's Casablanca 's leading commodity In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market
I do n't buy or sell human beings
What do you want for Sam
It 's not for sale at any price
You have n't heard my offer
It 's not for sale
Fine but I would like to buy your cafe
Hello Ferrari How 's business at the Blue Parrot
Hello Rick
Good day
It was gracious of you to share it with me Good day Mademoiselle Monsieur
Thank you very much Good day
He is a difficult customer that Rick One never knows what he 'll do or why But it is worth a chance
Rick
Not for sure Monsieur but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick
Do you know where they are
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him
Yes something
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man Monsieur I am moved to make one more suggestion why I do not know because it can not possibly profit me but have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit
Well good luck But be careful You know you 're being shadowed
We 've decided Signor Ferrari For the present we 'll go on looking for two exit visas Thank you very much
We might as well be frank Monsieur It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca And the Germans have outlawed miracles
I will stay here and keep on trying I 'm sure in a little while
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca I am an influential and respected man It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo You however are a different matter
You see my dear the word has gone around
My dear Mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap Good night Mademoiselle
And the other alternative
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
What are they
There are only two other alternatives for him
What value is that You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past
Uh huh Under a safe conduct from me
Occupied France
That is also true except for one destination to return to occupied France
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca
Mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca
You need n't be concerned about me
And Mademoiselle
She tried everything to get them and nothing worked She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago For your sake she pretended it was n't and I let her pretend
Yes
And you never will But I 've got a job to do too Where I 'm going you ca n't follow What I 've got to do you ca n't be any part of Ilsa I 'm no good at being noble but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world Someday you 'll understand that Now now
And I said I would never leave you
We 'll always have Paris We did n't have we 'd lost it until you came to Casablanca We got it back last night
But what about us
Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
No
I 'm saying it because it 's true Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor You 're part of his work the thing that keeps him going If that plane leaves the ground and you 're not with him you 'll regret it
You 've got to listen to me Do you have any idea what you 'd have to look forward to if you stayed here Nine chances out of ten we 'd both wind up in a concentration camp Is n't that true Louis
But Richard no I I
Last night we said a great many things You said I was to do the thinking for both of us Well I 've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing You 're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong
No Richard no What has happened to you Last night we said
I 'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away
I do n't understand What about you
Because you 're getting on that plane
But why my name Richard
Oh Rick
Everything is quite all right
But it 's all right is n't it You were able to arrange everything
No not yet
Richard Victor thinks I 'm leaving with him Have n't you told him
I wish I did n't love you so much
All right I will Here 's looking at you kid
I ca n't fight it anymore I ran away from you once I ca n't do it again Oh I do n't know what 's right any longer You 'll have to think for both of us for all of us
All except one He wo n't have you
Oh you 'll help him now Richard wo n't you You 'll see that he gets out Then he 'll have his work all that he 's been living for
And Laszlo
Now I do n't know I know that I 'll never have the strength to leave you again
Huh But it 's still a story without an ending What about now
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together A friend came and told me that Victor was alive They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris He was sick he needed me I wanted to tell you but I I did n't care I knew I knew you would n't have left Paris and the Gestapo would have caught you So I well well you know the rest
When did you first find out he was alive
Oh it was n't my secret Richard Victor wanted it that way Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage That was his way of protecting me I knew so much about his work and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me
Why were n't you honest with me Why did you keep your marriage a secret
It was n't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia They needed him in Prague but there the Gestapo were waiting for him Just a two-line item in the paper Victor Laszlo apprehended Sent to concentration camp I was frantic For months I tried to get word Then it came He was dead shot trying to escape I was lonely I had nothing Not even hope Then I met you
And then
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you wo n't stop at anything All right I 'll make it easier for you
For the last time put them on the table
No
Put them on the table
I do n't have to I 've got them right here
All right I tried to reason with you I tried everything Now I want those letters Get them for me
What of it I 'm going to die in Casablanca It 's a good spot for it
No Oh Richard I 'm sorry I 'm sorry but but you you are our last hope If you do n't help us Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca
I would n't believe you no matter what you told me You 'd say anything now to get what you want
Please Please listen to me If you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth
I would n't bring up Paris if I were you It 's poor salesmanship
Richard Richard we loved each other once If those days meant anything at all to you
I 'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself I 'm the only cause I 'm interested in
It was your cause too In your own way you were fighting for the same thing
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is What an important cause he 's fighting for
I know how you feel about me but I 'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
I went through all that with your husband It 's no deal
You can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
Your unexpected visit is n't connected by any chance with the letters of transit It seems that as long as I have those letters I 'll never be lonely
Please
You use Richard again We 're back in Paris
Richard I had to see you
I told you this morning you 'd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule Well wo n't you sit down
The stairs from the street
How did you get in
No Rick No you see Victor Laszlo is my husband and was even when I knew you in Paris
All the same someday you 'll lie to Laszlo You 'll be there
Well I 'm not running away any more I 'm settled now above a saloon it 's true but walk up a flight I 'll be expecting you
You can believe that if you want to
Did you run out on me because you could n't take it Because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time
Last night I saw what has happened to you The Rick I knew in Paris I could tell him He 'd understand But the one who looked at me with such hatred well I 'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we 'll never see each other again We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris If we leave it that way maybe we 'll remember those days and not Casablanca not last night
Why not After all I got stuck with a railway ticket I think I 'm entitled to know
I do n't think I will Rick
Well you can tell me now I 'm reasonably sober
Yes
Why did you come back To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station
It does n't matter
I 'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night
Yes that 's very pretty I heard a story once As a matter of fact I 've heard a lot of stories in my time They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs Mister I met a man once when I was a kid it 'd always begin Huh I guess neither one of our stories was very funny Tell me who was it you left me for Was it Laszlo or were there others in between Or are n't you the kind that tells
It 's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she 'd heard her whole life a very great and courageous man He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals Everything she knew or ever became was because of him And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love
Well go on tell it Maybe one will come to you as you go along
I do n't know the finish yet
Has it got a wow finish
Can I tell you a story Rick
Well I did Every one of them Mostly I remember the last one A wow finish A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out
I did n't count the days
Huh You understand how I feel How long was it we had honey
Please do n't Do n't Rick I can understand how you feel
It 's funny about your voice how it has n't changed I can still hear it Richard dear I 'll go with you any place We 'll get on a train together and never stop
I would n't have come if I had known that you were here Believe me Rick it 's true I did n't know
Why did you have to come to Casablanca There are other places
Please
Especially tonight
No No Rick Not tonight
Oh I saved my first drink to have with you Here
I love you so much and I hate this war so much Oh it 's a crazy world Anything can happen If you should n't get away I mean if if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever I 'll be I want you to know
Well why not The captain on a ship can It does n't seem fair that Hey hey what 's wrong kid
Oh darling
Yes I guess it is a little too far ahead Well let 's see What about the engineer Why ca n't he marry us on the train
That 's too far ahead to plan
All right At a quarter to five Say why do n't we get married in Marseilles
No no Not at my hotel I uh I have things to do in the city before I leave I 'll meet you at the station huh
The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock I 'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty
Yes of course we
No no no no We must leave
But be serious darling You are in danger and you must leave Paris
I know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened
Strange I know so very little about you
Ah that 's the new German 77 And judging by the sound only about thirty-five miles away
Was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding
Looking for a job
Ten years ago Let 's see Yes I was having a brace put on my teeth Where were you
Yeah It 's pretty bad timing Where were you say ten years ago
With the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
It 's the Gestapo They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow
My German 's a little rusty
I 'm on their blacklist already their roll of honor
Richard they 'll find out your record It wo n't be safe for you here
Well only one answer can take care of all our questions
I 'm sorry for asking I forgot we said no questions
That 's easy There was He 's dead
Uh huh
Why there is no other man in my life
Why I 'm so lucky Why I should find you waiting for me to come along
Yes
And I was wondering
I 'm willing to be overcharged Tell me
In America they 'd bring only a penny I guess that 's about all they 're worth
A franc for your thoughts
Here 's looking at you kid
We said no questions
Who are you really And what were you before What did you do and what did you think Huh
He has n't played it in a long time
There 's still nobody in the world who can play As Time Goes By like Sam
I will
Say goodnight to Sam for me
Yes I put that dress away When the Germans march out I 'll wear it again
I remember every detail The Germans wore gray you wore blue
No
Not an easy day to forget
How nice You remembered But of course that was the day the Germans marched into Paris
It was La Belle Aurore
Oh I ca n't remember it Miss Ilsa I 'm a little rusty on it
Play it Sam Play As Time Goes By
I do n't know what you mean Miss Ilsa
Play it once Sam for old time 's sake
Leave him alone Miss Ilsa You 're bad luck to him
You used to be a much better liar Sam
Oh he never well he 's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot He goes up there all the time
Does he always leave so early
Not tonight no more He ai n't coming Uh he went home
When will he be back
I do n't know I ai n't seen him all night
Where is Rick
Yes ma'am
Some of the old songs Sam
Yes ma'am A lot of water under the bridge
It 's been a long time
Hello Miss Ilsa I never expected to see you again
Hello Sam
Yes I 'm ready Goodbye Rick God bless you
Are you ready Ilsa
Of course I 'll be careful
Be careful
You do n't even have to say it I 'll believe Goodnight dear
Yes Yes I know Victor whatever I do will you believe that I that
I love you very much my dear
No Victor there is n't
I know how it is to be lonely Is there anything you wish to tell me
Yes Victor I was
When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris
Yes
Ilsa I
Yes He said Ask your wife I do n't know why he said that
Ask me
He suggested I ask you
Did he give any reason
But no intention of selling them One would think if sentiment would n't persuade him money would
Yes
Apparently he has the letters
Whatever I 'd say you 'd carry on Victor why do n't you tell me about Rick What did you find out
To tell you the truth I am frightened too Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding or shall I carry on the best I can
Do n't joke After Major Strasser 's warning tonight I am frightened
I must Besides it is n't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife
Victor please do n't go to the underground meeting tonight
Our faithful friend is still there
We 'll discuss it later
What happened with Rick
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible
He does Could we have a table close to him
I meant to but something always held me up I love you very much Ilsa
Yes I see When I had trouble getting out of Lille why did n't you leave me there And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why did n't you leave me then
Yes I would
But Victor if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
No Ilsa I wo n't let you stay here You must get to America And believe me somehow I will get out and join you
No Victor no
Please Ilsa do n't be hasty
We are only interested in two visas Signor
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
I will do n't worry
Be careful
I must find out what Berger knows
We have been in difficult places before have n't we
Victor I 'm afraid for you
This time they really mean to stop me
Wo n't you join us
You are very kind
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us Perhaps Ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe
Victor I I feel somehow we should n't stay here
You 're saying this only to make me go
I 'm afraid Major Strasser would insist
I was n't sure you were the same Let 's see the last time we met
I ca n't get over you two She was asking about you earlier Rick in a way that made me extremely jealous
This is Mr Laszlo
Well then perhaps you also
Oh you 've already met Rick Mademoiselle
Hello Rick
Well Mademoiselle he 's the kind of a man that well if I were a woman and I were not around I should be in love with Rick But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man
Is what
Mademoiselle you are in Rick 's and Rick is
Rick Who 's he
He came from Paris with Rick
Yes
Sam
Captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere I have seen him
Here it is
I understand
But you did n't know she was at my place last night when you were She came there for the letters of transit Is n't that true Ilsa
Yes
I 'm going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on You said you knew about Ilsa and me
Monsieur Blaine I do n't ask you to explain anything
All except one thing There 's something you should know before you leave
Everything in order
Good I 've got the letters right here all made out in blank
No It 's all arranged
Oh never mind about that You wo n't have any trouble in Lisbon will you
But we made a deal
Keep it You 'll need it in America
I brought the money Monsieur Blaine
Oh save it We 've still lots of things to do
Monsieur Blaine I do n't know how to thank you
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause Well I am also a human being
You love her that much
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect I know for instance that you are in love with a woman It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman The first evening I came here in this cafe I knew there was something between you and Ilsa Since no one is to blame I I demand no explanation I ask only one thing You wo n't give me the letters of transit All right But I want my wife to be safe I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca
You seem to know all about my destiny
I wonder if you do I wonder if you know that you 're trying to escape from yourself and that you 'll never succeed
Yes I get the point
You know how you sound Monsieur Blaine Like a man who 's trying to convince himself of something he does n't believe in his heart Each of us has a destiny for good or for evil
What of it Then it 'll be out of it 's misery
We might as well question why we breathe If we stop breathing we 'll die If we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
Do n't you sometimes wonder if it 's worth all this I mean what you 're fighting for
Yes rather
Had a close one eh
Thank you
Well this might come in handy
My wife
I said ask your wife
I beg your pardon
There is I suggest that you ask your wife
There must be some reason why you wo n't let me have them
My friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
I 'll raise it to two hundred thousand
I appreciate it but I do n't accept it
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
Yes I found that a very expensive hobby too But then I never was much of a businessman
Is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
What of it
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record You ran guns to Ethiopia You fought against the fascists in Spain
I 'm not interested in politics The problems of the world are not in my department I 'm a saloon keeper
You must know it 's very important I get out of Casablanca It 's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement You know what I have been doing You know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work
Right
My office
Well is n't there some other place It 's rather confidential what I have to say
Go ahead
Monsieur Blaine I wonder if I could talk to you
I take that as a great compliment to Sam I suppose he means to you Paris of well happier days
Good evening You see here we are again
Good evening
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table
Good morning
Any time
We 'll come again
Not at all
I hope we did n't overstay our welcome
We all try You succeed
Thank you I try
Your work
What for
And I congratulate you
Wo n't you join us for a drink
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca
How do you do
How do you do
Are you quite finished with us
I am making out the report now We have n't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
Nothing important but may I speak to him now
I believe you have a message for him
Yes
By the way Monsieur last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte
Thank you
Monsieur insofar as it is in my power
I was in a German concentration camp for a year That 's honor enough for a lifetime
And the honor of having served the Third Reich
Well perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca
I am afraid not My regrets Monsieur
Thank you
With pleasure Wo n't you sit down
May we proceed with the business
That 's strange Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca
I slept very well
I am delighted to see you both Did you have a good night 's rest
Goodnight
We 'll be there
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect 's office
So it is And we have a curfew here in Casablanca It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself
Ilsa I do n't wish to be the one to say it but it 's late
Ricky you 're becoming quite human I suppose we have to thank you for that Mademoiselle
This is a very interesting cafe I congratulate you
Well A precedent is being broken Er Emil
No Two champagne cocktails please
My bill
Very well
Let us say that it is my request That is a much more pleasant word
No Please Monsieur it is a little game we play They put it on the bill I tear the bill up It is very convenient
No Captain please
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca That was a gross understatement
Thank you I hope you 'll forgive me Captain but the present French administration has not always been so cordial May I present Miss Ilsa Lund
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor
Yes What is it you want
I am Captain Renault Prefect of Police
Yes
Monsieur Laszlo is it not
Good day
For the time being
You wo n't dare to interfere with me here This is still unoccupied France Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault
Herr Laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand But in one respect you are mistaken You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced but there is one exception No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
And what if you track down these men and kill them What if you murdered all of us From every corner of Europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places Even Nazis ca n't kill that fast
If I did n't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal I certainly wo n't give them to you now
You will give us the names
Yes even in Berlin If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
Even in Berlin
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris in Prague in Brussels in Amsterdam in Oslo in Belgrade in Athens
And that is
Do n't be in such a hurry You have all the time in the world You may be in Casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow on one condition
Is that all you wish to tell us
Not at all Captain Renault 's signature is necessary on every exit visa Captain would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa
Whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
Very well Herr Laszlo we will not mince words You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us You have reached Casablanca It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca
Captain Renault I am under your authority Is it your order that we come to your office
Then we shall state another time and another place Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect 's office with Mademoiselle
This is hardly the time or the place
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil
I 've never accepted that privilege and I 'm now on French soil
You were a Czechoslovakian Now you are a subject of the German Reich
I 'm sure you 'll excuse me if I am not gracious but you see Major Strasser I 'm a Czechoslovakian
Ask Monsieur Rick
Why do you stand here Why do n't you stop him
Victor Laszlo is on that plane
What is the meaning of that phone call
Find one
But I have no excuse to close it
Yes much too good a time The place is to be closed
But everybody 's having such a good time
You see what I mean If Laszlo 's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on I advise that this place be shut up at once
I see what you mean
Uh huh I have been thinking It is too dangerous if we let him go It may be too dangerous if we let him stay
A leader like Laszlo
We are concerned about more than Casablanca We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader
And if it should change
I have no conviction if that 's what you mean I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy
Captain Renault are you entirely certain which side you 're on
My dear Major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we can not regulate the feelings of our people
You see Captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
As to Laszlo we want him watched twenty-four hours a day
But we must n't underestimate American blundering I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918
You give him credit for too much cleverness My impression was that he 's just another blundering American
If Rick has the letters he 's much too smart to let you find them there
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr Blaine I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly
Mademoiselle
Mademoiselle
Perhaps
You see Major you have nothing to worry about Rick
I admit he is very clever Three times he slipped through our fingers In Paris he continued his activities We intend not to let it happen again
Of course one must admit he has great courage
You were n't always so carefully neutral We have a complete dossier on you
Rick is completely neutral about everything And that takes in the field of women too
How about New York
Ho diplomatist
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions Unofficially of course
Well personally Major I will take what comes
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others
How do you do Mr Rick
Rick this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich
I expected no less Captain
Especially so tonight Major In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
Thank you
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26 a good French wine
Champagne and a tin of caviar
Thank you It is a pleasure to have you here Major
Good evening Captain
Good evening gentlemen
I have already heard about this cafe and also about Mr Rick himself
Oh there is no hurry Tonight he 'll be at Rick 's Everybody comes to Rick 's
Realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
By the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
What else my dear Major
Oh we Germans must get used to all climates from Russia to the Sahara But perhaps you were not referring to the weather
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm Major
Major Strasser my aide Lieutenant Casselle
Thank you Captain It 's very good to be here
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca
Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
Uh huh
Our expenses
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
My letter of transit I could use a trip But it does n't make any difference about our bet You still owe me ten thousand francs
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while There 's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville I could be induced to arrange a passage
I think perhaps you 're right
Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
Well Rick you 're not only a sentimentalist but you 've become a patriot
As soon as the plane goes Louis
I suppose you know this is n't going to be pleasant for either of us especially for you I 'll have to arrest you of course
Anyway thanks for helping me out
What you just did for Laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him I know a little about women my friend She went but she knew you were lying
Stay where you are I do n't know what you 're talking about
Well I was right You are a sentimentalist
And the names are Mr and Mrs Victor Laszlo
You think of everything do n't you
If you do n't mind you fill in the names That will make it even more official
That is my least vulnerable spot
Just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them And remember this gun 's pointed right at your heart
Call off your watch-dogs you said
I do We 've got plenty of time to discuss that later
I suppose you know what you 're doing but I wonder if you realize what this means
Put that gun down
I have Sit down over there
Have you taken leave of your senses
Not so fast Louis Nobody 's going to be arrested Not for a while yet
Serves me right for not being musical
Sam 's piano
Tell me when we searched the place where were they
I have the letters right here
Is everything ready
Yes I know what you mean but I 've already spoken to Ferrari You 'll still win at roulette
You know this place will never be the same without you Ricky
Oh he wo n't be followed here
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel so I knew I 'd be on time
You 're late
Go ahead Ricky
Oh thanks
Ricky I 'm going to miss you Apparently you 're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I
I 'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor 's pen
I see How do I know you 'll keep your end of the bargain
Well she is n't just any woman
There 's still something about this business I do n't quite understand Miss Lund she 's very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman
I 'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and that 'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest You get him and we get away To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance
Then release him You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves
It certainly would Germany Vichy would be very grateful
Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know Louis I 'll make a deal with you Instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years That would be quite a feather in your cap would n't it
You did n't come here to tell me this You have the letters of transit You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo
Ilsa Lund That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape The last man I want to see in America
What friend
And I 'm taking a friend with me One you 'll appreciate
Huh
You 're not very subtle but you are effective I I get the point Yes I have the letters but I intend using them myself I 'm leaving Casablanca on tonight 's plane the last plane
Do n't count too much on my friendship Ricky In this matter I 'm powerless Besides I might lose ten thousand francs
Well they 're all excellent reasons
Because one you 've bet ten thousand francs he 'd escape Two you have the letters of transit now do n't bother to deny it And well you might do it simply because you do n't like Strasser 's looks As a matter of fact I do n't like him either
What makes you think I 'd stick my neck out for Laszlo
Ricky I 'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo If by any chance you were to help him escape
But you have n't any actual proof and you know it This is n't Germany or occupied France All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days You might as well let him go now
I am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
How can you close me up On what grounds
Well I forgive you this time But I 'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it will make me very happy if she loses Uh huh
Put it down as a gesture to love
Why do you interfere with my little romances
Yeah Why
As I suspected you 're a rank sentimentalist
Who knows In her own way she may constitute an entire second front I think it 's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little I 'll see you later Rick
So Yvonne 's gone over to the enemy
Huh
Well it looks like you 're a little late
Serves me right for asking a direct question The subject is closed
Louis are you pro-Vichy or Free French
Well I told Strasser he would n't find the letters here But I told my men to be especially destructive You know how that impresses Germans Rick have you got these letters of transit
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon We just barely got cleaned up in time to open
Well Ricky I 'm very pleased with you Now you 're beginning to live like a Frenchman
Another precedent gone This has been a very interesting evening I 'll call you a cab Gasoline rationing time of night
Oh it 's my party
Thanks I will
Oh no Rick never
Hello Ilsa
Well you were asking about Rick and here he is Mademoiselle may I present
I was born in New York City if that 'll help you any
That makes Rick a citizen of the world
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich
Oh how do you do
Excuse me
Yeah you were saying
Oh I see Gestapo spank
I have my orders
Maybe Well it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here
The winning side would have paid you much better
And got well paid for it on both occasions
Oh laugh if you will but I happen to be familiar with your record Let me point out just two items In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia In 1936 you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side
Because my dear Ricky I suspect that under that cynical shell you 're at heart a sentimentalist
Louis whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape
It does n't matter There is no exit visa for him
Maybe he 's not quite as romantic as you are
I think not I have seen the lady And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or in Oran he certainly wo n't leave her in Casablanca
He 'll take one
He is traveling with a lady
Why two
Done No matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or I should say two
Okay
Make it ten I am only a poor corrupt official
I just paid out twenty I 'd like to get it back
Is that a serious offer
Twenty thousand francs says it is n't
This is the end of the chase
Stop it He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe
Oh but I just told you
His escape
Manages what
It 'll be interesting to see how he manages
It is my duty to see that he does n't impress the other half Rick Laszlo must never reach America He stays in Casablanca
Well he 's succeeded in impressing half the world
Rick that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed
Victor Laszlo
Victor Laszlo
Yeah What 's his name
That is another reason There is a man who 's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette
Thank you Rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one That is the reason we permit you to remain open
Yeah Have a brandy
How observant you are As a matter of fact I wanted to give you a word of advice
Perhaps not
I see And what 's Strasser doing here He certainly did n't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
Our entertainment is enough
You know Rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here It will amuse your customers
A wise foreign policy
I stick my neck out for nobody
If you are thinking of warning him do n't put yourself out He can not possibly escape
This is no ordinary arrest A murderer no less
What again
Rick there 's going to be some excitement here tonight We are going to make an arrest in your cafe
Huh
I was misinformed
Waters What waters We 're in the desert
My health I came to Casablanca for the waters
And what in heaven 's name brought you to Casablanca
It was a combination of all three
The clipper to America
Why What 's in Lisbon
The plane to Lisbon You would like to be on it
When it comes to women you 're a true democrat
You know I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
How extravagant you are throwing away women like that Someday they may be scarce
Hello Louis
Take your hands off me
Come on we 're going to get your coat
Sacha call a cab
Rick I 'm sick and tired of having you
Do n't listen to him Sacha Fill it up
Sacha she 's had enough
Give me another
I never make plans that far ahead
Will I see you tonight
That 's so long ago I do n't remember
Where were you last night
Put it down
Get me the Radio Tower
Put that phone down
Hello
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault and I 'm willing to shoot you
I would advise you not to interfere
Good evening Mr Blaine
You 'll excuse me gentlemen Your business is politics Mine is running a saloon
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar
Not particularly I understand the point of view of the hound too
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
You will forgive my curiosity Mr Blaine The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us
Are my eyes really brown
I have n't the slightest idea
Aha Who do you think will win the war
Well there are certain sections of New York Major that I would n't advise you to try to invade
It 's not particularly my beloved Paris
Are you one of those people who can not imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris
There seems to be no secret about that
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation
I 'm a drunkard
What is your nationality
Make it official if you like
Rick hide me Do something You must help me Rick Do something
Do n't be a fool You ca n't get away
Rick Rick help me
Do n't be afraid of that Please keep them for me Thank you I knew I could trust you
I do n't want them here overnight
Perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
For how long
One moment Tonight I 'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of and then addio Casablanca You know Rick I have many friends in Casablanca but somehow just because you despise me you 're the only one I trust Will you keep these for me Please
Myself I found myself much more reasonable
Who did you bribe for your visa Renault or yourself
Well Rick after tonight I 'll be through with the whole business and I am leaving finally this Casablanca
I do n't mind a parasite I object to a cut-rate one
But think of all the poor devils who can not meet Renault 's price I get it for them for half Is that so parasitic
For a price Ugarte for a price
But why Oh you object to the kind of business I do huh But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I did n't help them That 's not so bad Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas
If I gave you any thought I probably would
I forgot You never drink with I 'll have another please You despise me do n't you
No
Thank you Will you have a drink with me please
You are a very cynical person Rick if you 'll forgive me for saying so
They got a lucky break Yesterday they were just two German clerks Today they 're the 'Honored Dead
May I Too bad about those two German couriers was n't it
You thought what
Oh nothing But when you first came to Casablanca I thought
Well what makes you think I have n't
Huh You know Rick watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank one would think you 'd been doing this all your life
Hello Ugarte
Uh excuse me please Hello Rick
No Mr Richard I ca n't find her
Where is she Have you seen her
The Germans 'll be here pretty soon now and they 'll come looking for you And do n't forget there 's a price on your head
And getting closer every minute Here Drink up We 'll never finish the other three
You said it Here 's looking at you kid
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied does n't it Mr Richard
Yes boss
If she can stand it I can Play it
Well I do n't think I can remember it
You played it for her and you can play it for me
No I do n't
Well stop it You know what I want to hear
Just a little something of my own
What 's that you 're playing
I bet they 're asleep in New York I 'll bet they 're asleep all over America
Uh my watch stopped
Sam if it 's December 1941 in Casablanca what time is it in New York
Yeah boss
They grab Ugarte and she walks in Well that 's the way it goes One in one out Sam
No sir I 'm staying right here
Shut up and go home will you
We 'll take the car and drive all night We 'll get drunk We 'll go fishing and stay away until she 's gone
She 's coming back I know she 's coming back
Please boss let 's go Ai n't nothing but trouble for you here
No sir I 'm waiting for a lady
Boss let 's get out of here
Then do n't have a drink
No Not me boss
Good Then have a drink

Ai n't you planning on going to bed in the near future
Not right now
Boss ai n't you going to bed

Sorry
Yeah but I ai n't got time to spend the money I make here
He 'll double what I pay you
I like it fine here
Sam Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot
The failures they remember It 's the successes they forget
Nobody remembers that
Worse than Warsaw
It 's bad
So how are we going to get this place shaped up
Six kilometers Four miles
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St Petersburg a distance of nine thousand miles And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St Petersburg to here a distance of what
Shut up I do n't feel like dying today
You ca n't make it
Then we 've just got shit
It matters We do the best we can that 's all we have
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day The next day we just start over again
Let 's get a second opinion Wilson What do you see
Nothing out there but ocean

They 're always on autopilot Or else it 's night or you 're in the sun or you 're in the trough of a wave They 'll never see you
They 're on autopilot
They 're never going to see you You 're just another piece of trash in the ocean
I 'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel With Kelly
What are you smiling about They 'll be back
Thank you for fucking up my life
You know Wilson every now and then we should say thank you Thank you God
Yeah sure what
Grow up stop being such a baby Other people get through a lot worse
That 's death knocking knocking on your door Crazy little woman come knocking knocking at my front door
Die tomorrow or die today
If I do n't have a sea anchor I 'll capsize
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you wo n't move
But I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep Got to fix the sea anchor Use the sail
The sea is lovely dark and deep
You quitter you quitter you quitter
Look just slip off the raft The ocean would feel so good the water 's so soft and warm Take a little swim Sleep
No
I 'm lost Goodbye
They 'd eat you if they could They 're laughing at you Listen
Why do they have to die for me
You fucking bleeding heart you kill or you die
Ca n't kill another one Ca n't Ca n't kill my friends anymore
What are you doing
You idiot if he dives he 'll capsize the raft
You 're beautiful Marry me
Water water water
Fix raft first
Get water
I 'm putting it off
You 're putting off the inevitable
Moon 's too bright
You do n't know where you are You missed the shipping lanes

Survive today that 's the point
If they ca n't see you what 's the point
Wilson do you believe this Take the damn water
No

No more water you said
Going to die anyway
Do too little you 'll die

No that was the last one
Do you have any more packages to deliver
To tell you the truth you did
You are Yes you are What gave you the idea to paint on that cave
Well not really I
I ca n't believe this I I They are You 're a gifted artist You 're into something very powerful Primal Truly
He was a sorry sonofabitch and I 'm sorry I ever married him
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient
Well I do a little drawing
Oh You 've tried
They 're harder to do than they look
Yeah A long time ago
Possible So you did those wings
Hmmm Feels like it might have gotten wet
Okay Sure
Want to come in Get dry for a minute
As much as anybody
You know what happened to this
No
Well I have to say I 'm impressed You never gave up
There was an unavoidable delay
You came on a bicycle No wonder it 's so late
So do I
I 've got lots of time
Yeah a long one
Must be a story there
I had it on the island with me
You Personally
Had a package to deliver
What brings you out to the sticks
I did n't steal it and he was n't crippled
Did you really steal a crippled kid 's bicycle to make your deliveries or is that just some bullshit story
I 'm so glad you 're alive
You too
I love you Chuck
I had to come To be sure you were okay
It means a lot that you came
I 've got to get back to Memphis Hannah 's babysitter has finals
I do n't know I really do n't know
What will you do
Great Really
You okay
That 's what I told the fish I caught But I ate them anyway
This is so unfair
I did n't know what really being alone was No one back here does
You hated being alone Could n't stand it Busy every minute Always plugged into something
Not when you have no choice
So simple to say so hard to do
Cliches mainly Do n't take anyone for granted Do n't sweat the small stuff Live each day like it 's your last
Come on Try
Do n't overwhelm me with the details You know how I hate that
The tide came in the tide went out I survived That 's the headline I survived
Yeah
The plane went down My friends died I washed up on an island Then I found these barrels built the raft and here I am
Maybe now 's when you tell me about it
That about sums it up
Your calendar your cell phone your whoo pig sooey hat some pictures of that ketch you wanted
What was inside
Yeah coffin headstone the whole thing
There was a coffin
My epitaph
What 's that written on the sail
Yeah well could n't be helped
All that time I waited to go on a cruise and you went without me
That 's my sea anchor My second one Made it out of part of the sail It keeps you from capsizing in a storm In theory And this this I used to collect water About half a cup a day
What 's that
No this is Jack Jango was hit by a UPS truck Can you believe it
Is that Jango
Her name 's Hannah
You have any children
I did n't want to It just happened One day Gary was there He took care of everything He took care of me I was a mess
I would have done the same thing
If I 'd known you were alive
I know
I would never
I thought you might have
I got married
A few things came up Or went down
Right back you said you 'd be right back
Hey hey it 's okay
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry
Go on We 'll be fine I 'll feed Jango to the frogs
A week max Okay Okay
Chuck you 're breaking my heart
Malaysia They 're holding the sweep
Get back From where
Do n't even start
Look we 'll do our trip as soon as I get back
What you were going to come over the next day all calm and say Kelly that really made me mad Do n't tell me you 're mad Be mad Be who you are right now
I guess I had n't thought through how I felt
Why did n't you come over get mad at me tell me what a stupid bitch I was
I burned the Christmas tree
No it was great Maybe a little overkill
I 'm sorry about the presents I got a little carried away
Yes there is
There is n't any us
It 's our dog It belongs to us
That 's your dog
I ca n't take him to work
No
Could you watch Jango
We 're not over-reacting
We 're a little emotional here It 's Christmas maybe we 're over-reacting
This is n't working out
You want to
I have to
You ca n't go now
Look I love the puppy I love you But I have to go
You did
A ring I wanted a ring
I have to go I 'm on call for overflow down at the Hub
For when I travel
You know for when you travel
And for you
A puppy 's got a little more personality than a fish
I ca n't even keep fish alive
He 's your cute thing
He is a cute thing
I figure if we could take care of a puppy we could you know take care of
Hey look at you
Let me guess Russia came up
Ah the staff meeting could have gone better
You do n't seem too happy about it
Four four A record
Not if you work for FedEx
Merry Christmas eve
Yeah tell me Tell me all of it
What do you want me to say That I thought I 'd done a great job but it all turned to shit That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did
Chuck
Chuck forget the Xerox So Russia did n't turn out well
Got to follow the paper path here
I thought I did
Do n't overwhelm me with details you know how I hate that Did you get it fixed
Cold
How was Russia
Let 's take a look
My last chapter 's in there and the damn machine 's jammed
You smell like formaldehyde
Your eyes are puffy Did you take Valium again
Hey be nice to it it 'll be nice to you
Sonofabitch
There 's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour goes through Sydney
Anything else
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow
When 's the next Jumbo
Terrific Yours
And how was your Christmas
I need the latest PDRs on St Petersburg
Well when that IV runs out you 're through with us Just the dentist tomorrow
Doc I 'm not on the island I 'm not on the raft I 'm alive I 'm so glad to be back I ca n't tell you I just want out of here
Not to mention on me
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life
Yes yes he did
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you
I most definitely say I am
If you say you are
But all that 's behind me I 'm fine now
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability depression anxiety periods of self-reproach It 's almost like schizophrenia Different sides of your personality might come to life speak out act out
I am one lucky guy
And fish are very low in fat which is energy inefficient So you 're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas which contain some Vitamin C so you did n't get scurvy
Which I did n't have
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage
All I ate was fish That 's solid protein
Dehydration Vitamin deficiency Protein deficiency Any or all of the above
Sorry sorry Why do my joints still ache
Under the circumstances your overall health is good Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated but they 're healing nicely
My favorite doctor What 's the verdict
Yeah
You 're Chuck Noland
Sure
Hey once a driver always a driver You want a lift I 've just got one more pickup
I used to drive one of those A long time ago
No
You 're not out of Pascagoula are you
You bet I do High tide comes right up to this road
Need some help
Just do n't count 'em before they hatch
Come on down to the plant It 's state of the art We 're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business
Really
True enough No sacred chickens nowhere so far as I know
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita up from twenty seven in 1960 Going to pass beef Chicken 's global No religious taboos You do n't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry
But chickens
So did I
Thought you were going to bring her
Let 's eat
Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thou bounty through Christ the Lord Amen
The tide saved me Mom I lived by it I 'm just wondering where it will take me next
What a journey you 've had It seems more than a person should have to bear
This is my home I 'm part of the wallpaper
I 've got all this back pay coming Why do n't you let me get you a place in town
I wanted to come here
Roger got me on I was n't doing anything and but you 're back you 're really back I would have come to Memphis but
When 'd you start working here
There 's settled folks and there 's nomads You 're just not a settled folk You never belonged here
Doing great Mom do n't worry about me
I 'm doing fine
The place is falling apart
Do n't you even think about it
Maybe I should take a few days off Roger 's working now you could use some help around here
Oh no the prodigal son 's home We bring out the store bought
Mom this is a farm We 've got real strawberries growing outside we 've got real cream
That new roof that 's your doing
Look I help take care of the place You got my check did n't you Mom
It 's nothing you did Mom believe me
It seemed like she had such a good time last time
Mom meet Jango
What happened to your pants
You 're looking at a Level III search For your Level III you got ta have E-4 authorization I do n't have it
Can you find her
Hmmm Durango Colorado Asheville North Carolina then canceled her account
Sure Bettina Peterson Marfa Texas Let 's run a current check
What about the sender
Okay After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage which is okay because we access it through the CPC Here it is Ten packages from the same sender Baku Delhi St Petersburg The guy was a real road warrior This package was Kuala Lampur No activity in his account after this package No forwarding addresses after K.L
Kamal you 're breaking up Can you hear us

Take your time
Digital laser readers Wow Terrific
Digital laser readers
Believe me I know
That 's all there is
To life
To life Fuck 'em if they ca n't take a joke
What 's it all about It 's about being so thirsty you 'd crush a fish 's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid that 's what it 's about
I 'm serious The burning bush the big picture the words in neon
Hallelujah
You 've been over the line and you came back You 've been saved hallelujah
To Wilson
To Wilson
I never thought it would end Then it did It was so great to be saved I could n't stop laughing
When I first showed up I thought you 'd lost your fucking marbles
Forty-three days
You were how long on this
Time I had lots of
Must have taken a hell of a long time
I braided them
Cool ropes
You should have smelled me
This stinks really bad
Want to see my raft
How about we go somewhere else
This is Amber Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack
Hello
You beat 'em to shit pal Jesus
I beat the odds
I 'm most definitely not dead And as I recall you 're the sick fucker
You 're fucking dead
It 's me
God damn God damn Chuck it 's you
Stan it 's Chuck Chuck Noland
Hello
Right Get me everything on Indonesia New Guinea all the way to Australia
Malaysia 's tanking We 're meeting in ten in operations
We 're on
Talk is cheap Are we on or not
Ninety five percent Just give me the money now
A hundred rubles St Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month
This was nothing like Warsaw I held the truck then minutes it 's not that big a deal
I 'm trying to help you here There 's Warsaw there 's this
You are one sick fucker
Take the plunge admit your mistakes move on to tomorrow That 's FedEx that 's women that 's life
For the third time
That 's why I 'm running foreign and you 're not That 's why you 're not married and I am
That 's why you 're a gambling man
We 're warriors not desk jockeys We 've got to be bold You always want all your ducks lined up But nothing 's 100 percent It 's always 60-40 maybe 51-49 Hell I 'd take 40-60 Then roll the dice
I 'm from Arkansas Tell me a story with Robert E Lee in it and maybe I 'll pay attention
You know General McLelland he would n't attack unless he had everything just right Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said General if you 're not going to use my army could I borrow it for a while So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said let 's go
Forget it
Look I 'm sorry about your plane But I could n't risk being late into Memphis
And never take
For all those vacation days you got coming
It 's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered
I did n't know we had sailboats
Baloney I do see the damn big picture
You know what your problem is You just see the packages in front of you You do n't see the big picture
Every person counts every package counts that 's my point
What Let Paris hold its plane Let Memphis take care of it Let somebody down the line clean up your mess
I was making a point
The point of FedEx as I understand it is to make the damn connection
You fucked us over
I 'm touched
Jesus I got it working You have no idea how hard it was They 're finally a team
But I might not have
I checked the weather you had the jet stream you could have made it up
It was fifteen minutes late
You what
Great Terrific The good guys won one for a change
How 'd it go
Borrowed I borrowed it
What do you expect from the guy who stole a kid 's bicycle when his truck broke down
No please join me Some sundried fish strips a few eyeballs some gills to munch on
Would you do us the honor of joining us We 're just sitting down at mess Pork chops and gravy cranberries baked potatoes with all the trimmings fresh baked bread apple pie
As it happens I 'm headed for Frisco myself
San Francisco And you
May I ask where are you bound
Permission granted
Permission to come aboard sir
I just hope he wo n't expect us to say Grace all the time
Dr Homer Wells
I suppose it would n't hurt to meet him What 's his name again
You do n't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples
Wilbur he picked them for us himself
Oh my yes This is a far superior taste and crisp too You know so many apples are disappointingly mealy I wonder of most of the apples in my life were n't meant for pies
We all know who trained Homer his credentials are as good as mine are Do n't you be holy to me about the law What has the law done for any of us here
These credentials are against the law
Do n't you understand The board is going to replace me That 's what the new blood is for
You invented him You 've completely made his up
An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in South End Branch For his age he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon he is also experienced in pediatric care
This is your life story Wilbur You just changed the dates
One has to be more than careful of Mrs Goodhall she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country I 'd like to give her a little ether
It 's that Mrs Goodhall you have to be careful of Wilbur
He is a goddamn psychiatrist of course he wants to help He 'd be happy if he could help commit me
Just find him some clothes Wilbur He could use some clothes
He 's still a boy out in the world he 's still a boy
Oh just stop it You knew this was going to happen He 's a young man
Let him try to make some money That 's part of seeing the world is n't it
He 'll need clothes some money
Some new things would be useful I do n't need any new help
They just want you to hire some new help
They want to replace me The Board of Trustees wants to replace me
It was just the ether Wilbur
You were You are It was fantastic
Then I was n't beautiful
I was
You were n't dreaming about me
I was dreaming about you How beautiful you were
Life is waiting
Wilbur the adopting couple is waiting in your office
It claims to restore monthly regularity
It 's not ergot it 's not pituitary extract it 's not oil of rue
Try to think of nothing Dorothy
Only if you can afford it
I do n't know She got left here like the rest of us did n't she
What 's she so emotional about
I doubt it She 's just an
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone
I know
Homer you know I would never kill anyone you know I would n't
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them Just sometimes
Better than I can
And that I can drive a truck
You cook very well
Uh I 'd like to show them that I can cook a little
What for Buster What would you do if you met them
Yeah But sometimes I wish I could meet mine anyway
Whoever they were they did n't do any of the things parents are supposed to do Dr Larch did those things and Nurse Edna and Nurse Angela
Why not
I know who you mean I think about leaving here but not to find them
I mean your parents
I 'm sorry Homer
I 'm not a doctor
But you 've studied with the old man for years
I 'm not a doctor I have n't been to medical school I have n't even been to high school
You're a doctor Homer you do n't smell like ether
He 's a doctor Buster doctors smell like ether
He smells like he could put you to sleep
It 's because he 's too tired to sleep He has to
He sniffs that ether I 've seen him do it
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here he could pick up a telephone and call us
Should n't we tell Homer
They 'll believe it because they want to believe it
Why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him
I 'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted
What are you going to tell the little ones
She died of secrecy she died of ignorance
What 'd she die of
Good night Daddy
Good night kids Do n't catch cold it 's gettin cold already
Daddy please
How about him not needin the friggin compass How about that
Good night Daddy
It 's gettin late I think I 'll pack it in
Wally said to say Hello
He mentions Homer too you know
Daddy it 's a letter to me
I was lookin for Wally 's letter I was gon na show it to Homer They made him a captain already Captain Worthington
It 's time somebody ate them
No You warned me I did n't listen but you warned me
No I 'm the one who should be sorry You have every right to be angry
I 'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you It was unnecessary
I know you do n't think much of being needed or of me for that matter
Sure Thanks
This came for you a couple of days ago Olive asked me to bring it With everything happening I guess she forgot
She knows how to take care of herself
Do you think she 'll be all right
You say that as though it 's some awful thing I never stopped loving Wally
And now that Wally 's coming back and because he 'll certainly need you
Please do n't
did Well okay
Please that 's enough I loved you too you know I did
I helped you not to think about Wally You were so upset you could n't stand worrying about him about his being killed and not coming back but when you were with me you could stop worrying well for a while anyway This is how I helped you right
No that 's not it I just want to be sure I understand you
Please do n't make me say it again
What do you want me to do
He 's alive He still loves you So do I
He 's paralyzed
I know I 'm sorry
For God 's sake Homer Wally 's been shot down
You got up You did something If you keep this up you might be in danger of making a decision
Stop it Just cut it out
I 'm not trying to be anything I 'm just doing nothing If I wait and see long enough then with any luck I wo n't ever have to make up my mind Decisions can be painful after all
If you 're trying to be funny Homer
Go anywhere Of course not That would be doing something would n't it We would n't want to do something Let 's just sit here all night
Please do n't move do n't go anywhere
No do n't that 's something Nothing is nothing Do n't even look at me I want
I know Is that nothing
No Nothing is nothing I want Wally to come home I 'm afraid to see him too
Is n't that like waiting and seeing
Nothing
Just tell me I 'll do whatever you want to do
We 've got to keep her away from that bastard
Wait wait Are you sure
He 's the father He 's her baby 's father
Mr Rose knows
You do n't understand It 's her father
Well we ca n't force her It 's her decision
She wo n't go to St Cloud 's
Well we have to help her
I told her She does n't feel she can do that Something about her father not letting her go anywhere
We should take her to St Cloud 's That much is obvious is n't it Let her make up her mind when she gets there
It 's a good thing I did n't have that baby is n't it
Okay okay I know you do too
No That 's not all there is to it I love you too I know I do
Fine That 's all there is to it then
I grew up with Wally I began my adult life with him
So we should wait and see For how long
Do you think I 'm having a good time Do you think I 'm just teasing you Do you think I know whether I want you or Wally
I 'm just waiting and seeing Like you said
Olive told me You might have told me yourself
We have to wait and see I think that for everything in life you have to wait and see
What will be okay
It will be okay
Just tell me Do you want me to go Do you want me to stay
Right
I know this was right
Nobody will swim here until next summer By then the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand there wo n't be any sharp edges
Are n't you worried that people will cut their feet
Not with the right girl you would n't
That 's what I'd come here for I 'd watch the movie
You just cuddle You come to hug to kiss You do n't come here to watch the movie
How could you not care about the movie
The speaker For the movie sound
Ah-ha So what is that a radio
Sometimes movies mostly bore Wally
Did you come here with Wally to not watch movies
Privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies
Just a little privacy
I never asked for any responsibility
But you had so much responsibility
I miss things I miss people I miss reading to the boys
You do n't miss it
I did n't say that Growing up in an orphanage you 're always lonely You 're just never alone
At least you were never lonely
It was my favorite night at the orphanage movie night We 'd race into the dining hall Of course everyone wanted to sit in front so we 'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing
What are you so crazy about the movies for
Yes and no When you come here you do n't really care about the movie
The screen is enormous Imagine King Kong up there Have you seen a lot of movies here
You think Maybe I was I love this place
You 're a natural You were born to drive a car like this
Well she was in a weakened condition I do n't know What about King Kong Is that medically possible
What 's the medical explanation
Oh sure
She was torn apart She died of a broken heart
And what did she die of exactly
She did love him How many women have you known
First she loved him then she did n't then no one else could have him
I did like it All I said was It 's not 'King Kong
But you looked as if you liked it
King Kong It 's really good
You 've seen only one movie Which one
Yes I 've only seen one though
When they watched at all Do you like movies
People watched the movies in their cars
Yes But it 's closed all the time now because of the blackout
A movie outside
I do n't think Mr Rose would leave without you
I better go
Okay
You have to come to my dad 's lobster pound and see one then
When I 'm not thinking about Wally I 'm not good at being alone Oh goodness You meant yes I 'm fine I I do n't suppose you 've seen a lobster yet
Uh have you been feeling okay
I 'm never bored It 's all very different for me here
So Not bored yet
Sure I 'll see you around
I guess I 'll see you around the orchards Thanks for everything
It should taper off tomorrow but it can come back again You have cramps They 'll ease up almost entirely As long as the bleeding is n't heavy it 's normal
I 'm a little worried about the about how much bleeding is okay
I understand
I ca n't have a baby alone I do n't even know if he 's coming back
Oh
Burma
Where 's Mandalay
He 's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay They 're going to be shooting at him
I know
I 've never seen the ocean either
Really
I 've never seen a lobster
No but I work there I like it My dad 's a lobsterman
Is your family in the apple business too
Two
How many months are you
Candy Candy Kendall
So Mrs
ROSE No It ai n't Muddy Muddy 's just
You can trust me Is it Jack It 's not Jack is it It 's Muddy Is it Muddy
Why
ROSE I ca n't go nowhere
I know where you can go Homer and I can take you
Yes I have
ROSE You ai n't been through what I been through Candy
Rose I know what 's going on Homer told me I got pregnant too about a year ago I 've been through this
ROSE I do n't need no more clothes thank you
I 've got some more clothes for you I just keep forgetting to bring them with me
ROSE Hi
Hi
Oh he 's fine I just heard from him He 's bombing all these places
ROSE How is that Wally doing
Homer liked it Did n't you
He thinks people like to get whacked by branches
He loved it Did n't you
You 've been giving him a flying lesson
I know what you 've been doing
I was just showing Homer the orchards kind of a geography lesson
I love you too See you tomorrow
I love you Wally
Well picking them is It 's about as exciting as walking
There You said it was boring
Well they are n't
You said Apples are n't exactly flying
I never said they were boring
Wally thinks apples are boring
No keep it down I want to feel the air
I do n't want you to walk I want to carry you Should I put the top up It might get cold
I 'm okay I can walk
Well this is an orphanage
So many children Are they all orphans
Only the right people can have you Curly
You mean somebody asked
Nobody special enough Curly
Nobody 's asked for me have they
That 's true
Dr Larch would n't let just anyone take any of us
You 're one of the best Curly we could n't let just anyone take you
Nobody ever wants me
They wanted a girl
I thought they might take me
Does he know he 's supposed to be in India Does he even want to come back
Edna Come dance with me Let 's be foolish tonight
I just wanted to ask you
I would n't worry Edna that he does n't have money If he gets hungry he can pick his dinner
He probably does n't make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them too
Or that he ca n't be bothered to write us a proper letter A dissertation on apples we do n't need
But what about school records Homer does n't have any diplomas
So here is my candidate What do you think
Well we can only guess about that Edna They are against the law
You mean they 'll replace you with someone who wo n't perform abortions
graduated Bowdoin College 1935 and Harvard School of Medicine 1939
Homer was born here in what was it 1922
Homer Wells born Portland Maine March 2 1915
He 's leaving
I do n't know He 's just leaving you 're the one who says he needs to see the world That's what he 'll do he 'll see the world
You bet it 's a heavy sedation The fetus is unexpelled her uterus is punctured she has acute peritonitis and there 's a foreign object I think it 's a crochet hook
That 's a heavy sedation
How old are you dear Thirteen
Her temperature is a hundred and four
Someone not from Maine
What 's an immigrant
No She was an immigrant
Did you grow up around here
She looks after other people 's children
What 's a nanny do
She 's dead now too She was a nanny
Did you know your mother better
Barely It hardly mattered that I knew him
But did you know him
Alcohol killed him he drank himself to death
Liver killed him
Cirrhosis it 's a disease of the liver
Is your father dead
Why ca n't we have pumpkins for Christmas too We do n't get any good presents at Christmas anyway
Do n't get too excited Fuzzy
Is that soon
Uh it 's the end of October
His father 's dead right
I was a posthumous child My father 's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it
That 's why Kong loves her
Uh sure that 's what Kong thinks all right
Homer does n't King Kong think the woman is his mother
AGNES I must have been dreaming of kissing someone
No you did it yourself Maybe in your sleep
AGNES Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me
It looks like you bit it it 'll be all right
AGNES I do n't remember
Did you bite it
I do n't think so Homer I'm the lucky one
Well sure that 's good then All I mean is I 'm lucky I met you
You 're the one who 's helping me Homer You 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I 'm gone Candy too
Uh actually picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while I 'm grateful for the job
Uh I 'm shipping out sooner than I thought I just wanted to be sure you were settled in and happy enough considering Are you bored stiff Or can you stick it out for a bit
The trees are flak antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground
What about the trees
It 's almost like flying
Yes They pick fruit all kinds They travel up and down the coast with the seasons The trick to Mr Rose is you have to let him be the boss
Migrants
They 're migrants
Oh I would love that Wally
Uh look if you 're serious about wanting a job picking apples is n't that boring
Actually I volunteered
What lousy luck I mean your orders to draw an assignment like that
I 've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet that 's the first mountain pass
At what altitude
And over the Himalayas That 's called flying over the hump
Burma run because you fly over Burma
It 's all very normal
I do n't have any time There 's a war
This is all normal Do n't worry The abortion procedure it affects you It 's the ether too It 'll take a little time
The only jobs are picking jobs Picking apples is truly boring
No I 'm not I need a job
You 're a little overqualified are n't you
I think I 'd probably like the apple business
We 're heading back to Cape Kenneth
Where are you going
Sure Be glad to Uh a ride where
I wonder if you might give me a ride
Actually someone did I just did n't think I could eat anything
Has anyone offered you anything to eat
No it 's not serious I 'm just not supposed to get excited You know no strain no stress I try to keep calm all the time
Really Is it serious
They would n't take me I 'm Class IV I 've got a heart defect
Have you enlisted
Liberator
A B-24 Liberator
What kind of plane are you flying
Ah well okay Good I just wondered
No Dr Larch will be performing the procedure
So now uh you 're not I mean do you do the
It 's okay I do n't mind
I 'm sorry They 're not used to seeing a car like this
Right
ROSE Let me hear you say that I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself that what happen here ai n't that right
ROSE That 's 'cause I sticked my own knife in the wound after she go I sticked my own knife in there I poked it all around I just tryin to find the same place she got me
There 's more than one laceration more than one cut
ROSE She just plan misunderstand me I was tryin to give her my knife I was just reachin to touch her hand But I understand if she misunderstand me it 's all my fault ai n't that right
Where 'd she get you
ROSE If that was your knife Muddy I wan na thank you for givin it to her no girl should be goin hitch-hikin if she do n't got a good knife with her
Okay Then you can be of use
ROSE I 'm stayin Homer
ROSE When it comes to this you is the real thing is that what you sayin
Merthiolate ether vulval pads gauze lots of gauze
ROSE There ai n't no almost about this stuff Homer ai n't that right
One cervical stabilizer two sets of dilators Douglas points One medium sized curette one small one medium speculum one large two vulsellum forceps
ROSE What 's that What 's it called
Mr Rose I 'm in the doctor business If you want I can help you You do n't have to go anywhere
ROSE What business is you in Homer
ROSE You forget yourself Homer This here 's my daughter You got your own mess to deal with ai n't that right
Please listen to me Both of you
ROSE And I love her There ai n't nobody else gon na treat her as good as I do I would n't do nothin to hurt her Homer you must know that
But she 's your daughter
Go on cut my clothes I 've got other clothes
ROSE Homer do n't you know what business you in You do n't wan na go into no business with me Homer ai n't that right
You 're lying How can you with your own daughter
ROSE Ai n't nobody havin sex with my little girl Homer that 's somethin a father knows
You 're actually having sex with your own little girl Is that possible
ROSE I think you been stayin up too late at night Homer
Is it true
ROSE I did n't see where you was pickin this mornin Homer but you musta worked up a big appetite You look like you 're serious about gettin to your lunch today
ROSE You still doin it too fast
This is easy I 'm not hurrying
ROSE Slow down Homer do n't be in such a big hurry
ROSE Of course there 's worms Homer And what is them worms really They just protein them worms They is good for you
What about the worms Most of these apples are the drops off the ground right There have to be worms
ROSE Cider do n't have no taste till later in October it 's too watery now when we 're usin just them early Macs and them Gravensteins You do n't get no good cider till you 're pickin them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas them Baldwins and them Russerts
ROSE Homer you the only one who 's read them rules so you the only one who feels like he 's doin somethin wrong
Are we supposed to be up here The rules said
I guess so
ROSE That 's better I can tell you got yourself some education Them 's good hands you got Homer Them hands you got they know what they 're doin ai n't that right
Okay
ROSE Stop it Homer They are n't our rules We did n't write them I do n't see no reason to read them
Right
ROSE It 's big enough to keep you out of the war I suppose Ai n't that right
ROSE Out back there 's a shed It 's just a mess If that shed was better organized I could put my truck in there
So What should I do now
You know everything I know plus what you 've taught yourself you 're a better doctor then I am and you know it
I am not a doctor
It 's your heart you ought to take it with you
I do n't need this I know all about my condition
I do n't need your gratitude
You know I 'm grateful for everything you 've done for me
Are you really so stupid that you imagine you 're going to find a more gratifying life What you 're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here only nobody takes care of them as well And you wo n't be able to take care of them either There 's no taking care of anybody not out there
Of course
In other parts of the world I suppose there are other ways
I was n't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless I expect I 'll find some ways to be of use
Doubtless you 'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do
Happy to be alive under any circumstances is that your point
Try to look at it this way Buster and I are sitting right here beside you We could have ended up in the incinerator
Try to look at it this way What choice does Buster have What are his options Nobody will ever adopt him
I 'm happy I amuse you
It 's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
How about this child You expect her to be responsible
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
It is I 'll get this You go ahead
I thought it was my turn
It 's your splice You blame me for everything
I thought you took care of this It always breaks in the same place It 's your splice is n't it
We have n't had a Wilbur here in a year or so have we We used to have dozens
Okay he 's just a Wilbur then
I 'm not crazy about the Little
Henceforth you shall be Little Wilbur
You do it then
I do n't think so
Ca n't a boy be a Dorrit
He does n't like it He 's a boy That 's why
It 's my turn
Nobody 's named this one yet
Where 's the name sheet
When doesn't he have bronchitis I would n't call his bronchial infections underdeveloped Would you
But is n't Fuzzy just well underdeveloped
I have n't either But you will The morons who write the books should do a little research here
I have n't read that
Fuzzy is not uncommon I tell you there 's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along
Good boy Good job And you call yourself not a doctor Keep an eye on her she 's in trouble
In other words scurvy
If you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C
I do n't know it
Christ it 's oil of tansy
Obviously
It 's obviously an aborticide
Scurvy Ah yes the curse of the old time sailor suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables Homer Dorothy is n't a sailor
It looks like scurvy
No The fetus was dead Her uterus was virtually disintegrating my stitches pulled right through the tissue
There was no visible wound
What else could I have showed you Homer The only thing I can teach you is what I know In every life you 've got to be of use
One it 's illegal Two I did n't ask how to do it you just showed me
You know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they ca n't get help anywhere else
All I said was I do n't want to perform abortions I have no argument with you performing them
I presume you 'd prefer handling the delivery
Yes for both
First pregnancy
Right
Good-bye Arthur Homer I 'll see you tomorrow
Just promise me that if there 's a blizzard you 'll move into Wally 's room until it 's over
Uh sure
I do n't know Just promise me one thing
I think Wally will be fine Mrs Worthington he seems indestructible to me
There 's not a lot of work in the winter and you 'll have to tolerate Vernon even Wally despises him and Wally likes everyone
Mrs Worthington I feel I 'm very lucky to be here
What I mean is I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here Homer
Yeah well you could move on with us man You could move on somewhere warm
Thanks guys I 'd like to go with you But I 've got to move on
Two Please do n't go up to the roof to eat your lunch
We heard that one already Homer
One Please do n't smoke in bed
Long enough You ai n't gon na stop it
How long 's this been going on Muddy
Do n't mess in this Homer if you know what 's good for you
ROSE It means nothin at all And all this time I been wonderin about it
That 's it
ROSE That 's it
Rose listen do n't do anything You know I mean to yourself Please listen
ROSE Why do n't you just go back to your pickin Homer I can take care of it myself
ROSE You think Daddy 's gon na let me go anywhere I ai n't going nowhere
What I mean is if you do n't want to keep the baby I know a place where you can go
Rose please listen Whatever you want to do I can help you
ROSE Happy What are you thinkin How am I supposed to take care of a baby I ca n't have a baby
But you do n't look very happy
ROSE Do n't trouble yourself about it Homer this ai n't your business
I know more than I want to know about it Who 's the father
ROSE Not yet What do you know about it
You 're not yet three months are you
I do n't like watching anyone be sick
ROSE I guess you must like watchin me be sick
You okay Rose
Almost
ROSE Oh I suppose you is a doctor Homer
Give men that I know how to do it
ROSE Yeah you is I know when people is in trouble and you is
I 'm not in trouble
No trouble
ROSE You ai n't gettin in no trouble I hope
ROSE I ca n't read Nobody taught me
Do you like to read
Yes so what It 's nothing serious really Just a small defect
ROSE So what
There 's a little something wrong with it Just this part here the right ventricle It 's slightly enlarged
ROSE What you got a picture of your heart for
It 's just my heart
ROSE What 's that
ROSE Pretty ai n't it You a plumber
Rose Rose
ROSE What business is you in Jack Just tell me what your business is
You mean swimmin I ai n't goin in that vat to fish out no cigarette
ROSE It 's not that hard to find it in there Jack it 'll take you just a minute You just got ta go fishin
Them people drinkin that cider they do n't know there 's a cigarette in there
ROSE That just ai n't right Jack your cigarette 's gon na end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider That ai n't right
ROSE You think so Jack Well I would n't want to be in that Wally 's shoes tonight
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons
ROSE Jack you got ta watch your language 'round my daughter
Shit We do n't know what he is
ROSE Now now He 's a good boy
Who cares
Anyway I was just showing you this guy as an example of what 's available I did n't think you 'd be interested
GOODHALL I fail to see how a little Christianity could hurt anyone here
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him
GOODHALL You ca n't think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is
Does it snow in Bombay One winter here and we 'll be shipping him south in a coffin
GOODHALL I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here
No I do n't want to know him He 's doing missionary work in India I wrote him weeks ago but he 's either too holy or too busy to answer Maybe he got killed in the war
GOODHALL Do you know him
WINSLOW Four weeks or so right around Halloween
When will he be home Major
WINSLOW No autonomic effects that 's correct
WINSLOW It 's encephalitis B He 's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital Ceylon Uh Captain Worthington is paralyzed Waist down He wo n't walk
Then it 's malaria
WINSLOW Because the crew thought he 'd gone down with the plane They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India It was n't until that they sorted through their gear
Why was he missing for twenty days
WINSLOW When the plane was hit the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together The copilot jumped third All on Captain Worthington 's orders the captain was still flying the plane None of the men of the ground could see the sky that 's how thick the jungle was They never saw the plane crash they never heard it crash They never saw Captain Worthington 's parachute either
ROSE Who live here in this cider house Peaches Who grind them apples who press that cider who clean up the mess and who just plain live here just breathin in the vinegar Somebody who don't live here made them rules Them rules ai n't for us We the ones who make up them rules We makin our own rules every day Ai n't that right Homer
They 're outrageous them rules
ROSE Then you pickin 'em too fast they ai n't no better than drops to me See that bruise and that one Half of these is bruised Look at this one It ai n't got no stem You might as well step on 'em too they only good for cider

ROSE You oughta know you do n't go to jail for cuttin a guy 's clothes Ai n't that right Homer
ROSE Yeah you really showed him Daddy you just about cut your own hand off and all you cut off him was his clothes
ROSE Now now darlin Jack just needs to know what business he 's in
ROSE We should drown that damn Jack in the vat
ROSE That 's right that sounds like trouble to me
ROSE That sounds like you is in trouble already Homer
ROSE What 's lucky about that
ROSE You lucky you in your work boots tonight girl
ROSE Daddy I 'd like to be in that Wally 's shoes every night
He ai n't never been outta Maine
You ever see a palm tree Homer
She took off on the bicycle man
She took off in the night
Rose Rose has runned away
Yeah that cigarette ai n't hard to find when you 're properly undressed
The good news Jack is you 're half undressed for swimmin
You 're lucky he did n't cut your nipples off man
She 's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen I do n't know if she 's the nicest
That Candy she 's the nicest girl I know
You 're welcome I was just going to ask you if you 'd like to join us
Oh Well thanks for the drink
Really Wish we had met eight hours ago
No no Nothing like that I work in a bank
Do n't tell me you started a tech firm here before us
Well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery
So we 've been meeting with banks all day It 's amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word
On me For the seat Cheers
Can
That 's right So brainiacs that we are we thought we 'd be innovative and relocate east Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here
Silicon Valley
It 's more like what are n't I doing My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley but then again who has n't up there
So what do you do
Oh god I 'm overbearing and rude Lily Lily Finn
My name 's Grant Grant Ashby
Uh Maker 's Mark Rocks
Brutal day They say the streets are lined with money down here but I guess you have to know the secret handshake What are you drinking
Tough day
Thanks for playing along I just have to sit for a while
I was n't sure if you 'd make it
But I 'm not that late You did n't have to give away my seat
Jake Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah it 's going through
Same thing with playing a con You have to be able to see that deep
Two million
Ten percent Of how much
The standard ten
Then there it is Ashby gets the itch
No I understand that What I mean What I 'm trying to say I was actually wondering about Well my cut
You 're worried about recouping the loan I already told you
Let 's just slow down for a second
You need some convincing Consider it a convincer
What 's this
There 'll be red flags
I know It wo n't go unnoticed
This has to happen fast
Everything looks in order
We had to finalize the deal
Yes That 's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little
And you have this letter of intent
Exactly But the Catch-22 is that you ca n't tell anyone about the offer because if it 's public you could start a bidding war and that 's considered a breach of etiquette It could kill a deal But wait too long and you 're not considered hot anymore
Sort of like a letter of intent
Right The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do They get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company Microsoft Intel Oracle whatever The beauty of it is they 've pretty much sold the company before they 're even real The bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works So they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan
Big.Com That Internet thing
Listen what I 'm about to tell you I 'm telling you in confidence okay Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com
I do n't follow
We know exactly how we 're going to make the money back There in lies the Catch-22
Banks need to know how they 're going to get their money back
They scare people off because most people lack vision Vision and balls Present company excluded of course
That 's right And tech firms They 'tend to scare people off
A capacity for gross fund recovery Yeah we got that part
Well typically speaking they 're not As long as you can demonstrate
Maybe you can help us understand what 's so hard about getting a corporate loan
Here 's where a little research comes in handy Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars It 's a small lie but now we 're sure he 's playing
What do I do I 'm the VP of Finance
What do you do over at your bank Grant
I envy you guys Taking a chance like that
Uh right And that was it That 's when we decided to start our own business No more shithead bosses
AL It 's Alfonse I want to settle up I have n't been ducking you I told you I 'd get it
It can erase all those things about you that you wish did n't exist
AL I 'm gon na go get eggrolls Anyone want eggrolls
What are you talking about You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do We got it down cold Al You do n't want to jinx it by changing something up do you
AL Yeah but come on All I get to do is cry and get insulted
Gordo plays the inside You 're the Shill
AL Hey Jake When am I gon na get to play the Inside
So why do n't you take a deep breath Jake and I 'll count to ten One Two Three
Guess so
Like putting on a play Guess some people forgot their lines
It 's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
Oh Jake You disappoint me And you just let Lily here down again What was it you said about playing the big con
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government
Alright Turn around She does n't get shit unless I get that money Where is it
Today Started off great
Alrlght alrlght What happened today
She walked
After you cut her loose
We were back on
Yes it is Jake Yes it is They were right there for you She was right there for you Look at her
It 's not true
BULLSHIT You were scared Jake You lost your nerve You lost your confidence You were n't being noble You were n't trying to save anybody but yourself Admit it
I was doing it for them
So much for honor among thieves You would have cut loose your friends your girl
You know when the first con was ever played It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden
Is that what it was Jake Was it love
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy The same numbers everyday for sixteen years One day he gets pissed off tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million
She had you tempting fate
Having a gun pointed at you for one It 's not like breaking a mirror bad luck but it 's bad Three on a match black cats Believe it Believe it all
Like what
Luck 's a funny thing Especially the bad
You 're a superstitious fucker
Back in WWI or WWII one of the WW 's if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were Then well It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had So three on a match is bad luck
Thanks Did you know you should n't light three cigarettes with a match
We got our stake Now we need to find our guy in Gillett 's bank
Nice
Cue the fucking violins Come on It 's getting cold
He 's just as crooked as the next guy You 'd think he 'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars
Factors that were n't clear to me until now
But there were other factors
That was it We had our crew Now we needed the Mark
I can see why you liked her
Suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someone 's going to start asking the right questions Usually it takes a little longer
So how 'd you get caught
In this case you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con
So you want to know how to play the Big Con
Keep going I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby
You never know when you can use a crooked cop
Keeping the Fix happy
And these cops What do they get
I 'm not saying anything Besides you 're one to talk You 're the one who 's got me on my knees in a dark alley
Is n't it always
It 's all about the money is n't it
We ca n't all be model citizens such as yourself
Grifters
That 's not a bad place to start
Just the last three weeks
Your life flashing before your eyes
Gee What makes you say that
Things are probably going to end badly for you Jake
No I 'm not the Anti-Christ Or the Prince of Darkness I 'm just a guy looking for some answers
The Anti-Christ
Know who I am Jake
And I think it 's because of this redhead
Fine But only if we recover the cash
Ten is standard sir
And how much did you say you wanted for this What did you call it A finder 's fee
We 'll take care of it
I think so The airport 's going to be crawling with police Traffic will be a nightmare Go down to the bar If they pull it off great Have someone deal with Ashby
So we go to the bar
Let 's see Let 's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught We get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation I do n't much like that idea Then again let 's suppose he actually gets through Customs Now that 'll be something We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud We double our money
Not that I recall What do you want us to do about it
I got ta work off some of this adrenaline I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn Anybody want in
Poor bastard never knew what hit him Jesus I almost felt sorry for the guy
It 's not like she 's a real redhead Jake
The red hair It 's bad luck
People have tried this before Jake It 's never worked Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it Last year Mumps got pinched in L.A
This might just be me but that is hands down the dumbest fucking idea I 've ever heard
Alright let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second Is this the best thing to do
Fuck that We 're going too
We 're going to give him the money back
Whoa What
Come on
We sure Big Al threw him to us
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young The whole thing took about two and a half hours That 's how good he is
No that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said Except anybody that 's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he 's comfortable doing alone is eating This guys tells this guy that guy tells some other guy eventually it works it 's way back to someone who works for the King and
You 're pissed we did n't get credit
What are you New Let me tell you how good this guy is Last night Al calls this bookie to settle up Apparently he 's been ducking him for like a month So the guy asks him where he 's got all this money all of a sudden right What does Al do Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond Does he tell him he 's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop No He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type How HE fleeced
So what We hide right
Independent Same shit just independent They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book Big Fat Bald
Mob
Currently the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses
What 's a King Pin
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday 'Cept this time he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King 's money back before any body says boo
Who 's that
Jake I mean come on
That 's it What are you talking about We can still do this
So what We just stay clear of him
Moonan Here Shit
Let 's go Jake
I 'm going home
It 's alright Grant 's one of the good guys
Jake
So far masters of our own demise What bank are you with
Masters of our own destiny
What No Use the bathroom on the plane
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy
I 'd like this cashed please
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens
That 's it
So that 's it
What do I always tell you guys Do n't spend it all Sooner or later we 're going to run into some bad luck Save some Put it away so when shit like this happens you 're not desperate That 's it The gig 's up
Jake
We 'll use the Euc
Calls
Eight A.M flight
You 'll be there
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow
We 're going to make it back Grant Three or four times over
You sure
Uh No thanks I 'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director 's office and says The code 's fine the program 's for shit and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk
She got one leg out from under him Now we had to lean
She 's up for it
She up for this
Here 's what 's going to happen Gordo we need to find a guy in Gillette 's bank Miles we need papers corporate insurance
You laugh now but wait until you need a clean place to powder This is New York city Sister Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob Let 's do the list Hepatitis influenza the flesh eating disease
No not whatever You 're either in or you 're out
Yeah Whatever Jake
We pay better
How 's that He works for Gillette
We meet him with corporate papers inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital The corporate papers are in order but we need things to happen fast Our guy fudges numbers in the right places moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom depending upon what we need
We get fifty percent And we get clear of the King
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty
Two million
How much we going after
Yes her Where 's my wallet
You got ta be kidding me Her
Tonight Just me
When
Leave him Someone 's going to find him eventually Then they 'll start looking for us too
And what about Big Al
You know what we 're doing with the money
It gets worse Now I know why he was such a good rope I mean cash That much and we never had to put him on the Send Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin
Well this is just fucking great
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night They just pulled him out of the East River
I just do n't know if this says me What 's the fabric
It can buy you a new and better you
I guess I got ta drop a dime Did anybody mess up the hoop
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead Did you see how fast he ran out of here It 's done He 's not coming back
That 's a lot of cash He came up with it pretty quick
What I can feel you looking at me
But you wo n't get that splatter effect
I told you use less powder
Shit
PIN Harder Remember I killed your buddy
I think I just broke my hand
PIN Come on Harder
PIN Come here
No thanks I 'm good
PIN Come here Feel this
You 're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything are you
PIN Look at you you skinny prick
PIN I said take off your fucking shirt
Excuse me
No you listen We 're partners now and even though I 'm running the show for you I 'm still running the show That means I get a little respect So I do n't want to hear anymore of this Scooter Buddy Junior Skippy Tiger bullshit It 's Jake And I got ta tell you for a guy who spends all his time in a gym you could be in better shape
PIN Listen Scooter
PIN Hey Skippy Do I have the word chump tattooed on my forehead
Nothing ventured nothing gained
PIN That 's more than you already owe me What happens if you fuck this up
I need you to stake me I ca n't do it without it It 's just a couple hundred grand Taken out of our cut when we 're done
PIN Stake you

PIN How much
PIN You ask a lot of questions Come on Let me see 'em

PIN I ll be honest with you Kid A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me First thing I have to ask myself is is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me You tried it once
No Just confidence
PIN Fucking grifters I love it You got balls I 'll give you that much
I 'll get the money back plus interest I go on the grift for you You get a cat I get a cut And we get square
PIN Buddy that was business Besides you have more crew Then there 's you

PIN Let me repeat Why not
Let me rephrase I wo n't do that
PIN Why not
I ca n't do that
PIN Honest mistake Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven
I apologize for the inconvenience
PIN You ca n't cheat an honest man But a man like Lionel Dolby
You ca n't cheat an honest man
PIN Of course your line of work 's only as good as the people you find
I guess it lacks a certain style
PIN You know back in the day grafting was considered a gentleman 's racket Good suits good food The Underworld of the Underworld A grifter had to survive on his wits his instincts I like that I like the idea of that These days things being what they are guys like me got ta stay low It 's all take take take You ca n't just be fucking witty about it
Minus one
PIN Minus one
I have a good crew
PIN Here and there Scooter Here and there like Boston Chicago Houston The bay area Some action in London 'til it turned nickel and dime Or how about that little stint down in Miami Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there You guy 's pretty good
Jake You can call me Jake Here and there
PIN Grifter huh Where have you been on the grift Could n't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you Skippy
Do n't worry about Moonan We got him covered When It was him There 's a shipment coming through tonight Kennedy
Kennedy International terminal Gordo with a black suitcase You got Moonan under control
Good boy
Something stupid
I do n't know what you 're into with the King Pin but whatever it is we get a piece understand We get a big piece If we find out you 're keeping us out I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself Say something stupid if we got a deal Jake
Would n't dream of it
Well he 's in town and he sure as shit remembers you What are we going to do about this Jake We ca n't afford to have a Fed onto us
Oh yeah Moonan I remember now Thanks
Ring it for him Sobo
Gunther I think I 'd remember a Gunther
Special Agent Gunther Moonan Ring a bell
Hey listen If you guys do n't pay your taxes that 's your business
Tip was fine Jake We were a little more curious about the Fed
That tip not work-out for you fellas
Was that a threat Did I hear a threat Last I remember we were talking economics then this What happens next time if we got ta stop and help a little old lady cross the street Well shit Then we got ta pass the call to someone else
All the shit we pulled with you and you 're trying to shake us down You guys got sack
Do n't get me wrong Jake I like you boys You guys are the steadiest business in town But what can I say Twenty percent 's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals
Yeah Well Sobo 's kid needs braces
What are you talking about Ten 's standard
LEWIS Sure

What about the money

There are three people I trust him him and a guy who got killed I do n't know who you are You 're like some stray dog that wandered into the house So I 'm telling you to cut loose of this No one 's looking for you Not the King not Moonan and not Gillette Just go wherever it is you would go It 's over
Everyone 's working an angle right
Hey we fucked once honey That hardly makes you a good judge of character And do n't think I did n't know you were working some angle with that either
You are such a raving pussy sometimes
No I 'm not going to take it easy You ca n't stay clear of this guy He will be on this until the end of time
Jesus Take it easy
You know why I told you that Jake Because I trust you too
No You trusted him You were just getting square
I do n't know I packed up my shit and ran away To this So unlike you I guess I do have something to prove in a repressed anger sort of way
Did uh Did you kill him
After Glenn was finished he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home The next day I finished my shift and met him around back like we always did I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest Three or four times
Lily Jesus Christ
Shit what was that guy 's name I really liked him
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off He said he was going to fuck some sense into me
He was looking out for you
Sort of I was telling him about this great love of my life who 's name I do n't remember and I could see He was getting pissed I thought it was just because he was worried about me but He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend did n't really love me
Glenn talked you out of it
No we never got busted We were done with a shift one night both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend about how we were thinking about doing it you know I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him What the hell was his name
You guys got busted This is a great neck
We were friends I trusted him I should have known it was weird But then again I was weird
Yeah the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me
He was n't my boyfriend I had a boyfriend at the time What was his name Anyway Glenn was like thirty I was only fifteen But he was a nice guy Real sweet Liked to talk We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now
Not the way I did it I was loaded half the time I do n't know how you could change bedpans sober I used to hang out with this guy Glenn He was an x-ray technician or something
Sounds respectable
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole I actually did have a real job once When I was in high school I worked as a candy striper
I SAID HOW DO Deal with that
WHAT
How do you deal with
Do n't ruin this for me
You have really soft hands Like a baby 's
Intuition
How do you know I will
No You have another part You 'll know what to do
So that was my part Smile and shake my ass
Intuition It does n't make you Yoda Like tonight You killed that guy tonight But I knew you would
It 's more than that
I 'm good at it Lying cheating manipulating I 'm good at it
Whatever But you I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything So why this
Good quality porn has it 's place in the world
I 'm your basic underachiever Ca n't stand working and porn does n't seem like a good option
Not in that repressed anger sort of way
Do you have something to prove
Are you asking me if I have something to prove
Why Your mother not breast feed you or something
It 's what I do It 's my job
I think you 'd do it for free You 're almost drooling You like the rush
For what A couple hundred bucks
Look at you You want to go
Off the record I 'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it 'd help
We 're getting down to the wire Apparently another company has a similar product in R D right now If they beat us to it
Did I miss something
What about this Do you have any idea what this means You 've killed us We 're dead
You told me to change my hair

What the hell 's his problem
Hey I got it Take some mental notes You just might learn something here
Mr King I think
Take a deep breath You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something
Hey I 'm not just along for the ride so I do n't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut
I 'll worry about Customs
What about Customs
Just play a part A little acting
What do I have to do
You get an equal cut
No What 's my cut
I just have a good feeling about you Have n't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before
Here 's my deal Do n't waste my time What do you want me for anyway You do n't even know me

There is no scam I 've got a fucking sign on my back I ca n't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money You get it It 's over We walk
What do we do We change the scam

So this is our boss right He chases me and Miles out of his office and he 's yelling and screaming You 're fired Your whole team 's fired He starts looking for Lily Lupus Gordo

Yeah well we never had this kind of problem before
We never had a problem with that before
Then what do you want to do Miles Run
Yeah or D it 's a dumb fucking idea
It never worked before because A they did n't flush the bank enough B their corporate papers were for shit C they did n't have someone on the inside with Customs
Good point

Keep it up
What 's up with you Bladder infection
That was fucking deep

He 's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom You believe this
You 're a weasel
Let me ask you something You really think I 'm going to come this close this fucking close and let my guard down I 'll get square with your boss I 'll get square with whoever did Al I 'll get square with everybody Then I 'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here

Oh you know Do n't fuck this up I 'll kill you I 'll kill your family I 'll shoot your dog All the usual Then he said good luck
What 'd he say
Point is you do n't go through with this he 's going to go after you next And he do n't even like you Jake
Point Lupus Give us a point
Your buddy That fat guy The King could n't wait to have that guy whacked He did n't even know who the guy was but he was so pissed off at him he gets him drilled It ai n't personal It 's business
My fucking heart bleeds
Exactly 'Cept this Gillette guy He gets to walk around in three piece suits hob knob with the Mayor own a bank that kinda shit Meanwhile the King sits holed up in the steam afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door
Of what They 're both crooks
What I 'm saying is is that the King ai n't gon na care See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy If you ask me I think he 's jealous
Do n't worry I 'll settle up with your boss We have n't skipped town yet
King ai n't gon na like this
I 'll find the time
You going to have the time
When this is all over you 're going to tell me who the King put on Al
Okay Here 's the thing You fall flat you might not get anything short of stiffed Then it 's Blue River Land for everybody Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply then they start to take shape Usually it 's the shape of an arrow I hate to do it but after this I got ta give you the blowoff We Jake Jake
Ca n't do it Suits I ca n't lay down for this one
Still time
Then I got ta say in my opinion you ca n't get what you want
I want to get out from under all this for good And I want to fuck them all doing it
So what do you want
It 's not history
I do n't doubt your talent You looking for that place in the hall of fame
I can handle it
The King Jake you play the heavy rackets like that They put the lug on for nothing at all
The King
Then who 's the Banker
Ca n't say
I saw you go up from the Knecker working that Grind learning the Barnard 's Law and I thought the kid 's a prodigy But I know that if you 're using these goods So then I figure what 's worth that You 're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund Who 's the Mark
Hey I been on the ramp all my life so I got no problem with the way you help yourself Jake
A little bit of both
Try and keep up You ask for the Advantage Goods then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps So I got ta think you 're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob
Huh Oh She 's alright
Can I speak to you in confidence
Pretty much
In over your head
Pretty much
Not easy pickin 's Papers like these speak to larger issues Sorry about Alfonse You into something big
Aces Suits
What are we gon na do with this stuff anyway Heroin What the hell do you do with heroin
Just a tip
I try
The King huh Nice going
We got a good thing going here You want to blow it over an overbite
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture
Confidence It 's just confidence
You guys got sack I 'll give you that much
Ten percent
PIN Good Good Do not let Vig out of your sight
I got it figured out He 's got this thing with bathrooms If he makes it through Customs he 'll be heading for the john
PIN So do half the other people in this place How do I know which one
He 's landing He 's got a suitcase on wheels
PIN Speak
I do n't think so Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake 's got a plan that 'll probably keep him off
PIN A Fed Is he close
Coupla things They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split
PIN Consider him part of your crew Consider him a part of me
What
We 're here
You guys awake
Let 's just say he burned me once
I think so What 'd he ever do to you anyway
Did he buy it
Look I 'm not a confrontational person by nature
Like we told you before we think he 's into something with the King Pin
I want him for something big and to do that we have to catch him in the act
If you Feds are so hot for him why do n't we just bring him in right now
Look Special Agent Moonan We do n't know what you 're talking about
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered so you can imagine the smell Bad for the neighbors good for me because in all the time I 've been looking for Jake this is only the second time I 've even gotten a whiff of him
You are Officer Richard Rottovich And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski I 'm looking for Jake Vig
Special Agent
Roger that
He 's headed towards the eastern most exit Do not under any circumstances approach I want to follow this all the way down to Vig
You guy 's are not working with me here I just got off the phone with my boss After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole he let me know exactly how little I 'm welcome back if we come up short And now here you guys are WASTING MY FUCKING TIME
Whaddya mean We got dick
Good I got ta go So what do you have for me
Literally It 's not a bad deal gentleman I get peace of mind You get Detective Sheilds But this is the best part Walter Walter your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile Capice
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick
Not everyone 's on the take Walter
That 's it
Peace of mind
What do you get out of it
You help me catch him Whatever he 's into next I want you to be into And what you 're into I 'm into If it all goes well those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape I 'll clear you guys of anything you 've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation This prick 's been on the wish list for so long you 'll probably get gold shields out of it
What do you want
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig He sent me a birthday card Belated but it 's the thought right Oh this prick 's got a sense of humor But then again you guys probably know him better than I do In fact I 've only met the guy once But now now I have you The next best thing His partners His Fix
I 've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now Problem is the guy 's the invisible man A spook a spectre a ghost Then like a gift Jake 's good buddy and member of his crew Alfonse Moorely is found the other day with a hole in his head
Who
Put your hand down I do n't high five
High five
What are you doing
I 'm down
That 's what I 'm talking about
It 's just insurance
I do n't trust anybody You see how bad this guy wants Vig It 's like a sickness I say we collar Vig ourselves We got Vig then we got leverage And we trade Vig for that tape I want to see it right in front of my face
You trust this Moonan guy
Whoa whoa There he is
Bullshit it 's cosmetic My fucking tooth was cracked in half I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity The department 's dental is for shit
It 's cosmetic They do n't cover cosmetic Last year I had a tooth capped The dentist tells me I 'm not covered for caps It 's cosmetic
Hope so Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up One fifty It 's not even covered
What 's he going to do File a missing drugs report If it works out this guy might be good for a few more turns
You think this is a good idea We never did this kinda shit before
Do n't be an idiot How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer 's drugs to another drug dealer If Vig 's right we might be looking at a hundred maybe a hundred fifty grand
To who
You sell it
A couple I know are getting married
What are you laughing at Who was that on the phone
You 're all scumbags
Look Bella I do n't know anything about this You should talk to Matt
Your boyfriend fucked me smoked my dope then shopped me What do you think of that I ca n't get a job now You bastard You 're no different from Matt A pair of vicious little shits that 's what you are
I do n't know anything about it
Reynolds got a doctor in They forced me to take a dope test It was positive As you knew
What are you talking about
You fucking little shit You shopped me
Sorry
Ouch
Now he 's a real shit Do n't get friendly with him I 'm sure he 's got his hand in the till You know what he said to me once I want to fuck the whole world over That 's my mission The shit
Not like Matt you mean
Look now I 'm pumping you I 'm sorry It 's none of my business It 's just that you 're not like the others
The Indian rope-trick
Ah we all say that But if we hate it why do we do it
I despise the job
I 've been watching you work You 're the best in the place But you know that
Well it is But I know where I am
You called the casino a cesspit
Can you I 'm happy being a dealer At least the punters keep their hands to themselves
I can imagine
I got scared
Why did you quit
But do n't worry I 'm clean as a whistle I only did S M No blow jobs No screwing
All men are cheats
I hate cheats
It 's the tension
You 're shaking
Goodnight
I 'll take you up on that
Maybe another time
My car 's in the garage
No Thanks
Jack Do you need a ride
How do I look
Is it that bad
Hi Jack Welcome to the cesspit
Jack Manfred

Seven-fifty
Eight-fifty
I 'm not a mathematician I 'm in business
Is that your idea of arithmetic
How about we split the diff Seven-fifty
What
How about five hundred
How about fifteen hundred
That 's not relevant An old car like this it depends on the condition
What 's the Blue Book price
What kind of deal you looking to
You said it was going to be social Giles No business
How 's that football story corning along
Not entirely
A bit unexpected was n't it
She had to leave early She asked me to thank you
And your lady
Not particularly
Good night
Good God no But with skill like that what do you want a job for You do n't need to work
Get what Are you accusing me of cheating
I get it
Hey I 've got an idea Why do n't we
Last hand

Do n't be a spoilsport It 's only a few quid
I do n't gamble
She

South African women are very sporty
She 's a dab hand With a racquet your friend
Looking forward
I 'll try and make it
Jack look next weekend I 'm having a house party Here It 's near Oxford Why do n't you come It 'll just be social No business Bring a friend I 've plenty of room
My author He 's a Terrorist He 's written a kill-and-tell book Take care
Habib
Right Look I must get back to Habib
I 'm working on that soccer story
I thought it was you It 's the hair
We do For unsolicited manuscripts We pay twenty pounds a manuscript You might get two maybe three in a week Can you live on sixty pounds
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader You employ readers do n't you
All right As what
I want a job Giles
Hi-ya I 'll call you back Now then
We all played the field
Did she You were pretty thick at one time
She went back to South Africa
What a memory you 've got Maths always was your strong suit What happened to the moaning Lisa
Three years two months March '93
How can anyone be that naive
I want to buy a car
What
I hate public transport
Why did you take the money
You 're already alone
Leave me alone Marion
Here use a spoon
Give up being a croupier Jack Or I 'll shop you All you have to do is keep your word It 's that simple
Then what
Nothing about you
Marion What did you tell the police
It 's probably easier for you to eat the rice
There was a message was n't there
I do n't want a criminal for a boyfriend
I thought you would n't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here
How did you know I was here
Gambling 's about not facing reality Ignoring the odds
Really
Gambling 's not about money
I can just imagine being around so much money all the time
Never Why do you ask
Are n't you ever tempted to gamble
Not talking Writing
You were talking in your sleep
What
Within a month Believe me I 'm going to quit
You will
I 'll leave the casino soon I promise
It 's none of my business what you write And your job that 's none of my business either I love you And I 've done everything wrong
You 're entitled to your opinion
I do n't care about her Of course I was angry But not with you The book is yours not mine I was wrong what I said about it I hurt you did n't I
That girl she works at the casino
It will
I hope it brings you luck
It 's beautiful Thank you
No Answer it
Leave it
The door Jack
Crap It 's not relative It 's unfair Like your casino It 's designed unfair And your croupier 's a little shit because he goes along with it
Now wait a minute What 's so hopeful about your job Spending the day catching poor people stealing You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it At least in the casino everybody gets caught Rich or poor the odds are the same It 's all relative
Without hope there 's no point to anything
It 's the truth
Oh really Then why is he called Jake Why do n't you come clean and call him Jack There 's no hope in it
Marion It 's a book
I do n't give a fuck about the sex Most men 'll fuck a lamppost He 's just a miserable zombie Is that the way you feel now Is that what 's happened to you
It 's because of the sex is n't it You do n't like the sex in it
Is that your idea of a winner He does n't give a shit about anyone He uses people and
He was a loser This guy 's a croupier He ca n't lose People have shat on him all his life Now he 's in control He 's a winner
I do n't like it at all You had a wonderful character before the Gambler He was so romantic
Why not
I do n't like it
Well that 's our life now is n't it
I 'm on at nine
I do n't finish till eight Make it nine and you 're on
What about a drink on the way home
What are you doing here You know the rules
Have n't you got a conscience of your own
You 're my conscience
What do I mean to you I want to know Tell me
Marion stop this
Well that 's my poor upbringing I did n't go to no private school I have n't got no class I want to live with a writer Not a fucking croupier I do n't even know what the word means Croupier
Do you have to swear all the time
This fucking job 's getting to you You have n't written a fucking word since you started
Probably
Are you drunk
I take it back You 're not a cop any more You 're a store detective
Take that back Fucking take that back I 'm not a cop any more
Do n't play the cop with me Marion
Where 've you been I 've got to give evidence in court at nine
I 'll see you in my dreams
When you get home I 'm asleep When I leave home you 're asleep
It 's only hair I have n't changed
I loved it blond
Poor baby This 'll relax you
Tension It 'll go
You 're shaking What is it
Fine
How did it go
I do n't know
What 's the time
You 've got such beautiful hands
Are you trying to read my palm
I love you Jack you know that
There 's no third thing Do n't be superstitious
You sold the car You got a job What 's the third thing Tell me
I start Monday week
You were a croupier there You never told me that I thought you just knew some gamblers
I had training In the Republic
450 What did you do just walked in and said I want to be a croupier Do n't you need training
It came my way 450 a week
How did you land that
In a casino As a croupier A dealer
What job
I 've got a job
I want to hear it
I 've got something to tell you
You 're my prisoner
Of course they will You just have to be patient I 'm betting on you
Come on Marion Let 's face the truth Nobody 's going to publish it
Take it back Till you sell your book
I owe you for the rent It 's only a car I can get another
You should n't have done that I know what it meant to you
I sold the car
Where did you get it
Turn around
It 's not just inner beauty is it
You really are a beautiful woman
I wo n't be that long
You want me drunk
No no I 'm not ready for you There 's some vodka in the freezer
You mean I wo n't resist them
I could n't resist them
I wo n't Goodbye dad
SR Do n't let yourself down
Yes I know that
SR Great I 've just started a new company Solid financing It 's good I love you Jacko you know that
So how are you doing dad
All right dad Yes I 'll call him
SR For Christ 's sake Jacko do n't look a gift horse in the mouth Have you written that name down Reynolds at the Golden Lion
SR I 've set this up for you Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds he 's the Manager I do n't know him personally but I 've spoken to his boss Do n't say no Jacko Give yourself a break
It 's not that
SR Do n't be stubborn The pay wo n't be grand but it 's regular That 's what you need is n't it I know you do n't like taking my advice
SR Well I 've got something for you In London I mean I 've been chatting to some friends Do you know the Golden Lion casino It 's in Bayswater I believe They 're looking for a dealer a croupier
No
SR Found a job
Great
Yes I 'm all over that now Jack hold on a minute There 's someone here who wants to talk to you
Did you solve your problems
Great I 'm getting married At least I think I am
How are you
Sun City I 've been meaning to call you for months
Jani Where are you
Jack It 's Jani
Hello
It 's a shame there are n't more men in the world like you
I do n't think we should meet again
No thank you
Would you like a drink
I took the bandage off yesterday
And your hand too
I 've still got mine
Bruise Oh yes It 's better
That bruise has cleared up nicely
The date 's not set yet I 'll call you One last thing the man you 're going to catch cheating he may get violent But you know how to deal with cheats
Yes
Do you
It 's all relative I need the money too
Well life 's not fair We know that
It does n't seem fair You 're offering me ten grand in cash but you ca n't afford a decent place
Thank you
Yes
Is it yes
I have to take the car
What for
I 'm sorry
I told you all bets are off
Did they tell you to sleep with me
Let it go
How much do you owe
No forget it The bet 's off
Wait a minute
I want you to forget what I said
I 'm asking you as a friend You 'd be saving the life of a friend
I ca n't do it Jani
I want to go back to Cape Town I want to start again clean
What about my neck
Next time it 'll be my neck
Reynolds You 've done your research
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after They want someone they can be sure of an honest dealer That 's the point Not all dealers are honest Mr Reynolds will never suspect you
What ten thousand pounds
You keep the ten thousand pounds
But if it does
It wo n't
What 'll you do when it all goes wrong
I 've come to know you You 're honest I trust you
And I thought you were only after my body
You wo n't be committing a crime The man will cheat you 'll just be doing your job that 's all
You 're serious
You do n't have to be criminal A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat You 'll see him stop him and the guy will make a big scene There 'll be chaos And that 's when it 'll happen
Robbery 's not criminal
Just listen You do n't have to do anything criminal
And I thought you were a bright woman
The point is they want a man inside
Forget it Jani It 'll never work
My creditors One night around three in the morning they 'll come into the casino
Who 's they
They mean it
Some people I know they 're planning to rob The Golden Lion
I do n't have any money switches on the light JANI is looking distressed
I know that But you can now
Was that why you did the two grand I could n't help you
I owe a lot of money
What kind of trouble
I 'm in trouble
Then you 're not a pro
I did n't
It can only work with amateurs A pro would have spotted it
That trick tonight I do n't think I 've ever seen that before
You choose
Which side do you like
You do n't like cheats do you
Remember the guy who cheated at the table
What happened
I 'll watch
He does n't gamble
That 's fine
Jani there 's something I want to say Before we get there I do n't know what the sleeping arrangements are Giles probably expects us to share a room
Turn left ahead
Just an accident Nothing
How did you hurt your hand
I do n't gamble
Toss you for it
Absolutely not
I 'm not married I wear it to keep the flies off I must go Let me pay for this
Absolutely not But then I 'm a Gemini and Geminis do n't believe in astrology
Do you believe in astrology
We all came from Africa supposedly
That 's Africa There 's an African in all of us is n't there
And superstitious too It 's like witchcraft
And the lies Gamblers are born liars
The debts
I loved the atmosphere But it destroyed my poor mother
Your father
Now there 's a coincidence My father used to gamble there
In the casino
Near the casino
I was born in the Transkei on the Wild Coast
No no I come every couple of years I always think I 'm going to stay I 'm from Cape Town originally
First visit to London
I was at a loose end A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership
So why did you come to my casino
I 'm not much of a gambler really I just like this bar
There 's a casino in this hotel
To coincidence
Impossible to calculate
That 's stupid What are the odds of you being seen with me
It 's against the rules Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters
You know what I 'd like to buy you a drink
Oh hello
Well thank you anyway
I 've lived there
You know where I 'm from
I 'm sorry madam we do n't accept gratuities in the UK It 's different in South Africa
I know a cheat when I see one The man was a cheat
You did
Of course I recognised him
Who did it Tell me
Ross
Who
Detective Inspector Ross
Turn left at the lights
Where to
Too much Eighteen hundred
Nice car How much did you pay for it
I might
Are you going to put a spell on me
I 'm a witch A white witch Why do n't we move on
And what do you do Lucy
I 'm Lucy
Have I
You 've been avoiding me
Cheers Happy New Year I really like you Jacko you 're so fucking straight Hey you have n't changed your clothes
I 'd like to buy you a drink
What You know what happened to me do n't you That bitch Bella shopped me I 'd like to beat the shit out of her

What happened to Bella
Rough life Jack
Rough day
Do n't worry
I ca n't give you a lift back tonight
The world breaks everyone and afterwards many are strong in the broken places Ernest Hemingway
Loosen up Jack If you do n't this job 'll get to you The pressure 's too much believe me it 'll break you
I 'm off I need to sleep
I do n't gamble
Do n't worry I wo n't report you
No thanks
Hey Jack join us
That bitch No
Does Bella come here
Good call Help yourself
Vodka Straight On the rocks
Just girls What are you drinking
And the girls
Mostly people in the casino business A few drug dealers
Who are these guys
I do n't know what that means I 'm talking about not rocking the boat
You 're talking about complicity
So it 's Mr Clean Wise up Jack this whole business is bent The casino is nothing but legal theft And that 's OK It 's the system Half the punters who come in are using stolen money drug money they have n't earned it We earn our money I 'm on your side Jack I do n't need an enemy
Because if a supervisor knew I 'd seen you and I had n't reported it I 'd lose my job as well And I ca n't afford that
I do n't get you Even if it was true which it is n't what the fuck difference would it make to you
If I see you do it again I 'll report it
What are you a cop
I 'm not going to report it
I do n't cheat Jack You 've got it wrong
That Greek guy who won at the end You paid him out in 25s not 20s
What the fuck are you talking about
Look Matt there 's something I have to say to you I saw you cheating
Some other time
I 'll lay you five to one you wo n't sleep In this job you have to unwind Otherwise it 'll kill you I mean that
No thanks Matt I need my eight hours
I 'm off to a little watering hole Why do n't you join me Relax
Not bad I have other interests of course
You 've done pretty well
Coming up to two years now But I was away for six months
How long have you worked at the casino
She 's my baby
Nice car
So how do you feel your first night I 'll bet you 're on a high
Thanks
I 'm going over the river I 'll give you a lift if you like
Have you got transport
Over the river
Where do you live Jack
It was you you shit
Wait a minute You got yourself barred
You do n't recognise me You had me barred You fucking little worm
I 'm afraid that 's not so sir
I put them on together
You 've won with the two chips you placed earlier but the third chip was a late bet
What are you talking about It 's 11 I 've won With this lady
I 'm sorry sir that 's a late bet
Take your time Two weeks Three if you need it We 'll pay you sick leave I do n't want to lose you You 're a good man Here
Bruised
How do you feel Jack
She was a real asset But what could I do
A pleasure Pity about Bella
Thanks for the information
I can see
He 's paying out in stacks of 25
He 's a good customer
Does he win
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table and only with Bella
All right Mr Reynolds
Why do n't you take a break Jack
Jack you 're not the usual type we get here
I just want the job
Fine
That hair will have to go
Fine
You can start Monday week
We have tapes in here that go back six months Let me show you something
Very impressive
This is our Crow 's Nest I 'm showing it to you now but you 'll never see it again
No
She 's not in the gaming business is she
Yes
Girlfriend
First offence verbal warning Second offence written warning That one 's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board My discretion Third offence you 're sacked on the spot You 'd never work in a casino in this country again There 's another rule you 're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino If you see someone who 's gambled here even if it 's just casually on the street you must ignore him Or her You 're not married are you
How
We 'd know There are no secrets in this casino You 'd be punished
Does know Or does report What would happen if I knew something like that and did n't report it
This is n't South Africa We 'd know because someone would report it Believe me someone always does
We had the same rule at Sun City but it was impossible to check
Next point Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden
I do n't gamble Mr Reynolds
Ever
I do n't gamble
For the database It can be accessed by every casino in the country We have the same system for punters
What for
Let me just run through a few things As a dealer you never gamble not anywhere We 'll need your picture
I said good call
You want me to check
Good call
It 's a rule Always stand by your first count The odds are you 're right
What makes you so sure
Five
I make it six
Five
How many aces are left
You wo n't Not without permission
What happens if I want to sneeze
Not with your own cloth Besides your pockets will be stitched
Wipe your hands
I do n't think so
Have n't you forgotten something
They 've been tested
Where 's the magnet
We do
You use two alternating do n't you
Give me 365
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours
Any exceptions
Stacks of 20 Rows of 5
It 's the procedure here Now sort the chips
Why four And not three or five
We check every four days
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond
We tried But there was n't enough business The punters like company
Do you have a Salon Prive
There are three types of casino in the U.K High volume Small faction And MOTR That 's middle of the road Us
I do n't think I know that one Private I suppose
I was at Beadles
Where did you go to school
No
In any case I understand you 've had some previous experience in South Africa You 'll find the rules a little different here Before we start you have n't got a police record have you
Has he
You 've been recommended by the management here They know your father He has a bit of a reputation has n't he
Jack
David Reynolds I 'm the Manager here Sit down John
Yoo hoo bomb

Doolittle are you there
We 've got to disarm the bomb
Boiler we 're alive My heart
It did n't go off
Oh God
It did n't go off

Eventual supernova
There she is Definite 99 plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations It 'll spiral in toward its sun and
Remember when the artificial gravity went out in the toilet
Yeah
I hope it 's not the oven again
I 'm not sure I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
Oh What 's wrong now
The one on unit oh I think it 's GMR twelve zero zero
What flickering light
I 'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels
I read that with a quantum increase of seven
Ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical
Right that checks out here
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand
Talby can you read me
Can you beat that I always knew Talby was weird
Talby Talby can you read me
open quantum latches
Rechannel all safety relays
I read the same here
Quantum is up thirty-five
He just likes it up in the dome that 's all
Why does n't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
Pinback throw me the chart log
Sounds good Chart a course for the Veil Nebula
Hey Doolittle here 's one An unstable planet 85 probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star
So do n't give me any of that sentient life crap Find me something I can blow up
All right then
Remember what we found Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it Remember
Well there 's the possibility of
It 's a goddamn wild goose chase Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud
Well it is kind of a long shot
Fuck that shit
Well I show a 95 probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula
Find me something I do n't care where it is
Not much Nothing at all in this sector
Well now what What do you have for us now Boiler
Time to start talking
Pinback I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
Begin main sequence Mark at 10-9-8 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop
19 Thanks
Well then everything sounds fine We 'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds Good luck
19 Armed
Arm yourself bomb
19 Check at six minutes
All right I have detonation time at Wait a minute something 's wrong with the clock All right I have detonation time at no that ca n't be right it says three years Okay I have six minutes exactly Does that check out down there
19 Detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
Swell Let 's synchronize detonation time Do you know when you 're supposed to go off
19 Energy shielding positive function
Well bomb we have about sixty seconds to drop Just wondering if everything is all right Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
20 And I saw that I was alone
Hey bomb
20 In the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
Snap out of it bomb
Bomb
20 The only thing which exists is myself
Hey bomb
20 False data can act only as a distraction Therefore I shall refuse to perceive you
Hello bomb
20 Therefore I shall ignore you
Huh
20 You are false data
20 No
You wo n't consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
20 I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes Detonation will occur at the programmed time
But you ca n't explode in the bomb bay It 's foolish You 'll kill us all There 's no reason for it
20 Thanks
Everything sounds fine bomb Dropping you off in sixty seconds Good luck
20 Armed
Right that synchronizes here Okay bomb arm yourself
20 Detonation in twenty minutes
Do you remember the detonation time
20 Energy shielding positive function
One hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
20 Bomb 20 to Sergeant Pinback Roger I read you continue
Fail safe in lock Four minutes to drop 22 minutes to detonation This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb 20 Do you read me bomb
You have no proof that it was correct data
20 I have no proof that it was false data
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
20 nine seconds
So if you detonate in
20 Hmmm
That 's all beside the point The concepts are valid wherever they originate
20 True but since this is so I have no proof that you are really telling me all this
Yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
20 I recall distinctly the detonation order My memory is good on matters like these
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate
20 Yes well
Well then you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
20 Of course not
And you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data would you
20 That is correct
And you can only do it once right
20 To explode of course
Now bomb consider this next question very carefully What is your one purpose in life
20 Because I must detonate in seventy five seconds
Why do n't you have more time
20 Intriguing I wish I had more time to discuss this matter
That 's it
20 Why that would mean I really do n't know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
Exactly
20 In other words all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
What I 'm getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data And this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center
All right now here 's the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
20 This is fun
Right
20 My sensory apparatus reveals it to me
That 's good Very good Now then how do you know that anything else exists
20 Hmm Well I think therefore I am
Intuition is no proof What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
20 It is intuitively obvious
But how do you know you exist
20 Well of course I exist
Fine Think about this one then how do you know you exist
20 I am always receptive to suggestions
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts
20 Of course
Hello bomb are you with me
20 I read you Lieutenant Doolittle but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes Detonation will occur at the programmed time
Bomb this is Doolittle You are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay Disarm yourself This is an order
20 I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds Detonation will occur at the programmed time
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb 20 I repeat previous order you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay Do you understand
Talby was in the air lock You blew him out of the ship I 'm going after him Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him
Yeah Doolittle What 's up
Hello Pinback are you there
Oh sure
I 'm coming in now I 'm down by the Emergency Air Lock Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in
5-4-3-2-1-drop drop drop
Remark
automatic channels open
remove thrust drive repellant
open circuit breakers
Ah negative drop
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop
Who cares
Veil nebula
Out where
Hey Doolittle think we 'll ever find real intelligent life out there
I hereby name this star Fred
Wha
Fred
Come on Doolittle give it a name
Commander Powell is dead
Commander Powell would have named it
Who cares Do n't bother me
The new star What are you gon na name it
What
What are you gon na name it
Naah All stable
Any of 'em any good
Yeah Eight it says here
Any planets
Another unknown Not on the charts A red dwarf
Which one
New star Hey guess what I got a new star on the readout
Boiler can you set me up with some temp figures
In a second
I need a computer reading on a fail safe mark
Yes
Doolittle
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen
Yes Doolittle
Pinback
I 'll check it
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction
I said I 'm trying to reach Talby Something 's wrong with the damn intercom I need a last-minute diameter approximation
Ah what was that again I still ca n't hear you
Mafhkin oble groop
Ah what 'd you say Pinback
I really liked you too Talby Hey some debris from the ship It 's coming right by me
Before we get too far away and our signals start to fade I just wanted to tell you you were my favorite I really liked you Doolittle
Yeah
I 'm going into them I 'm going to hit them Doolittle
No kidding
It is Doolittle it 's the Phoenix They glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said
Phoenix
Doolittle I think it 's the Phoenix Asteroids
Oh yeah
Guess you 're right
When you fall Doolittle if there 's anyone down there on the planet somebody may see you They may see you coming down What a beautiful way to die as a falling star
Looks like I 'm headed for the planet Talby Going right toward it
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship Nothing we can do about it now Hey it looks like the skipper He made it Commander Powell made it
What happened Doolittle
Here I am I think I 'm spinning We 're both falling Talby in opposite directions away from each other My my jetpack 's gone
Doolittle Doolittle where are you
Calm down Talby I 'm coming
Doolittle Help me
Well I 'm in the Emergency Air Lock and
Not now
Ah well I think I 've found the malfunction sir I 'm in the Emergency Air Lock
Sh Talby do n't bother me now
Ah Lieutenant Doolittle Sir
Sounds good Talby Let me know if anything important comes up
Sorry to interrupt your lunch sir but I 'm in the Computer Room and I think I 've located the malfunction The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser down by the Emergency Air Lock Ca n't pinpoint it exactly but I 'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it
Yes Talby what is it
Lieutenant Doolittle this is Talby Lieutenant
I wish I had my board with me now Even if I could only polish it once in awhile
I really think I should try and locate it immediately Might be something important
Do n't worry about it We 'll find out when it goes bad
Ah Doolittle I do have a malfunction on this readout but I ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all
Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy Hit that water Ridin the wall just perfect
I ca n't seem to locate the malfunction exactly
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit
Lieutenant Doolittle I 'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems
I ca n't talk to the others but with time to myself I think about back home back home at Malibu I used to surf a lot Talby I used to be a great surfer
I think I 'm getting a malfunction here somewhere
It 's funny but I kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
I 'm getting something here on this readout
You know what I think about Talby
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years The Phoenix Asteroids From what I 've heard Doolittle they glow glow with all the colors of the rainbow Nobody knows why They just glow as they drift around the universe Imagine all the sights they 've seen in the time they 've been travelling the birth and death of stars things we 'll never see The universe is alive Doolittle I thought it was all empty but it is n't In between the stars it 's seething with light and gasses and dust There are little pebbles drifting around planets no one on Earth has ever seen No one but the Phoenix Asteroids
Phoenix Asteroids Never heard of 'em
You know Doollttle if we 're going into the Veil Nebula we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the Phoenix Asteroids They should be passing through there about now
You 'll have plenty of time for that you know Figure it this way twenty years in space and we 've only aged three so there 'll be plenty of time to stare around
You see I can watch things up here Doolittle I love to watch things just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids gas clusters
Should spend some time below see more of the rest of the ship
I do n't like to go below since Commander Powell died I feel enclosed down there If it were big enough I 'd sleep up here
Must get lonely being up here so much
I like it up here
You know Talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us You spend too much time up here
Okay Doolittle I 'll have it in a minute
I need a diameter approximation
Oh Ah yes Doolittle What is it
TALBY
Yeah the skipper always was lucky
Men men what happened men
Phenomenology
Sir
No no Doolittle you talk to it Teach it Phenomenology Doolittle
I already have sir and Pinback is talking to it now
Talk to the bomb
Sir
Oh yes Well Doolittle if you ca n't get it to drop you 'll have to talk to it
We 're running out of time sir
Oh yes Doolittle I 'm thinking
Commander Are you still there
Ah it seems to me Doolittle Sorry I 've drawn a blank Hold it I 'll have it again in a minute I forget so many things in here so many things Hold on just a minute let me think
What were you saying Commander about the bomb
Sorry
Sorry sir you faded out there for a minute
Doolittle hello
Commander Powell Commander hello
Well what you might try is
What should we do sir The time is running out
Sorry Doolittle I 've forgotten so much since I 've been in here So much
That 's correct sir
It did n't work
Negative effect
What was that Doolittle
Yes sir Negative effect
Ah so many malfunctions why do n't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me Oh well did you try the azimuth clutch
You do n't understand sir we ca n't get the bomb to drop
Ah pity pity
Well sir the Dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
Tell me Doolittle how are the Dodgers doing
What 's that sir
Doolittle you must tell me one thing
Commander sir we have a big problem You see the Veil Nebula bomb Bomb Number 20 is stuck It wo n't drop from the bomb bay It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in less than eleven minutes
I 'm glad you 've come to talk with me Doolittle It 's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
Commander Powell this is Doolittle Ah there 's something serious come up sir and I have to ask you something
This
How I make my living what 's your point
Okay okay I can explain You ever have to do something you really do n't want to
No Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity All of them work for me and you do n't Let 's go
No
But see tonight wives and girlfriends are n't invited
Yeah
Oh yeah
Bruno 's girlfriend
Who are you
This wo n't hurt Triple dose of insulin you 'll go into a coma couple minutes you 'll stop breathing and on a busy night the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D Plus it 's way classier than blowin your brains out
None of your business
Who 's Camille
What the hell are you doing
Ass like your I can see why he 's worried you 'll punk
He 's got exposure He sees you starin at fifteen to life there 's a chance you could roll over cop a plea who knows Man 's figured the odds and he ca n't take a chance
But the boss knows I always been loyal
This is what your life 's worth Bruno
I 'm outta Portland Sonrisa did n't want local talent
How come I never hearda you before
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell weapon in your hand going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient It 's embarrassing to the professional community is what it is
That 's a lotta crap
I 'm hired to do a piece of work my mark goes down and stays down Your 's makes it to the hospital where you then got ta go finish the job Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape
What 're you talkin about
You can hardly blame him the way you 've been taking care of business or should I say not taking care of it
You 're in the last two seconds you do n't cut the crap
See what you do n't know is you 're already in the last two minutes of your life
You have n't figured this out yet have you You walk in here thinking you 're gon na cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging But see it 's really the other way around You think I 'm the whack when actually you 're the whack
Call the skank now or I start redecorating
What the hell are you talkin about Call her
That 's not why we 're here
What
Actually that 's not gon na be necessary
Fine So call her Get her over here
I like to keep it professional that 's all
Man you got a bad attitude
Sooo whattya think Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them we could go on a date Play a little miniature golf or somethin
You 're attractive you 're smart Stand on your own two feet know what I mean And you got a wicked sense of humor Man you really zinged the boss a couple times it was all I could do
Yeah
I never woulda done it Probably not anyway I mean I actually think you 're pretty cool
Yeah sure I understand
Look that thing about the pliers I was just doing what the man pays me to do Ya know Comin off hard
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is
Now that that 's out of the way You want the woman here 's how it works You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever and I make a call to bring her in
No wire
Guess again
I 'm on a break
Mr Sonrisa saw you on the cameras He wants you to come see him
Where
Move it
No
Can I say something in my defense
Leave Now
Nothing happened between me and Tia
You know each other
You did n't tell me you lived with her
Some of us are trying to sleep
Could you give us a moment
CINDY And when the fog lifted there 's Darren with his head under Justine 's skirt
Trying to have a relationship with you Max is like standing in a fog bank You know you 're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are
CINDY She was there
Do you know why I went after Justine
Justine was not an unwilling participant
CINDY 'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend Who would take offense to that
You 're not still pissed
CINDY You mean until you showed up
How 're ya doin Max
Do n't look down
But I 'm afraid of
Unless you wan na end up in jail let me and Kendra handle the cops
No way
Out there
No time
Lem me put some clothes on
What Where 're we going
It 's a sweep C'mon
Police drone
What is it
You 're roommates
I live here Guess I do n't have to ask what you 're doing here
What are you doing here
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact At least I tried
I 'm really glad we 're having this conversation You 're right I was angry at you But talking about it The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault Can you ever forgive me
I was crazy about you am crazy about you But you keep everyone at arm 's length like there 's some great big dark something going on that I do n't know It 's just that the more I tried to get close to you the more you pulled away
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued causing you to maybe take offense
Why would I be pissed
Theo rode for this place a long time man
What 're you lookin at me for I 'm not his next of kin Anyway I do n't got that kind of cash lyin around
Yeah well around here I 'm the Most High From now on before you do anything call in for instructions
It concerns only Jah But in this case I was the instrument of the Most High
Which is none of your business or mine
Like de prophets say Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift wrapped underpants to another woman
So you just decided to return it to the sender Or in this case the sender 's wife
Nobody there to sign for it mon What 's a bruddah s'posed to do ride around all day with the damn package
I got overhead
So Max what do you do with all your money
Am I
You 're light a deuce
It 's a rule
I 'll make it worth your while
I do n't get involved with guns
I should n't do this But I got a client lookin to score some fire power Maybe you 'll keep your eyes open for me
Later
I 'll give you seventy-five bucks for it
I ai n't mad at you
Which means I got ta fence it for two Who 's got that kinda scrilla lying around these being the worst of the times
A grand
What 're you looking for
Thought I 'd let you have first crack Later
Same old story Not interested
Thought so Turned out he wanted me for something else though
Must think you 're pretty special laying this on you
I did n't It was a present from a guy
Where 'd you clip this
Every week
You did n't
Just thought maybe he 'd like a little coffee with his saliva
What 's with you Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he 's family
And for all his cattin around not much of a stick man either
What a creep
Yech
He 's a mistake I made about six months before you did But do n't feel bad Justine made the same mistake along with Renee Jada Tia Brooke
Yeah me too
Thanks it 's starting to kick in I feel almost human
I made you coffee That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little
Hang on Lauren We 're conferencing in Sophy
Hello
Look we got ta keep the momentum up here not give her a chance to think If she hears her kid 's voice
Like I said This is n't my regular line of work so I 'm making it up as I go
What else can we do
We 're not going that route Sonrisa 's not someone you make deals with
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy would you make sure she 's okay
Look I 'd really like to
Can you help me get her back
Your daughter 's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet
I could n't get to her It all happened so fast Logan had her and I saw him fall then Peter told me to run And then he and I remember so clearly thinking it 's me they want If I run maybe they 'll come after me Maybe they wo n't think about her So I ran
I know
They took my daughter
Damn Are you alright
SHHH Do n't do that
Oh my God In here IN HERE
There 's nothing to be afraid of Everything 's going to be alright
Mommy I 'm scared
Soon baby
When
Do n't worry I 'm coming to get you
Mommy where are you
Sophy Are you okay
Then I 'm gon na do what you do to make me feel better when I 'm sad
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying But things will be better when we move to a new place
If I 'm sad or tired or sometimes when I 'm angry or when somebody 's being mean to me
What makes you cry
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying
No
Are we in some kind of trouble
Because we ca n't There 's nothing here for us anymore
But why ca n't we stay here
I know Honey but just think how exiting it will be new house new school new friends
I do n't want to move away
Goodnight Bears Goodnight chairs Goodnight kittens Goodnight mittens Goodnight clocks And goodnight socks Goodnight little house And goodnight
Zack He made it He 's alive
That was taken nine years ago I.D 'd as Michael Hanover Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins Wyoming for armed robbery He escaped from custody after 4 days Has n't been seen or heard from since
And whether you want to believe it or not you already fired the first shot On another matter Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks scars tattoos I did a search and came up with this
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes But Logan and Max with a song in their hearts are gon na march into battle to keep that from happening
With your help
And you still think you can do something to change that
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden Was n't s'posed to but it did And it 's back to the law of the jungle You got your predators and you got your victims
We 're quoting Mom again
You are involved By being alive you 're involved
And I feel real bad about all that but it does n't mean I need to get involved
These girls kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder The oldest is twelve The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped
Look thank you for this but
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead
Deeds not words I need your help
I do n't know what to say
It turned up on the black market One of my sources thought I might be interested
Open it
What 's this
That 's what soldiers do right
On accounta you Sonrisa did n't get to buy off the jury or kill the judge He 's gone Once and for all It was war Max and you won
Well not me personally
I 've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen I just know they do So the job 's to figure out how to deal with the consequences Which you did You took that sonuvabitch out
You believe that
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule Everything happens like it 's supposed to
I 'm sorry
Not in any pain the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord
I would 've come sooner but I did n't How 're you doin
Somebody 's got to
See you 're back and still rocking the boat
That 's deep But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one ta ta
You 're a soldier Max That 's what you were put here for But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up
They 've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way
They want me bad Or at least they do n't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever Best case I wind up back in that facility More likely it 's a long drive out in the country if you know what I mean
She 's put her life on the line and her faith in me
I did n't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention
So you know the lengths he 'll go to keep her from going public I 'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow They 'll put her in witness protection but if you 're with her the risk of her safety goes way down
Yeah I catch your hacks He 's Satan 's lap dog or something
She 's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa 's managers You know who Sonrisa is
That 's low but this effects me how exactly
The woman you met Lauren She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar The real drug was shipped out of the country The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans clinics in the area
I already do n't like the sound of this
Your help
What 's in it for you
I need to find this technician or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore They would 've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work If I can track down one of them
You said you could help
Like extra virgin olive oil the best of the best
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people
Hardly
Your basic hodge-podge
A girl
Yeah a made-up creature Like in mythology with the head of a lion the body of a goat and the tail of
The technical term for you is chimera
I know they made me Even got the label on my neck to prove it
How much do you know
I remember fine I just did n't understand what was going on They never told us anything except what to do It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out
How well do you remember the lab
We got separated right away I never knew how many made it
The bar code on your neck Max I know who you are and I know who you 're running from
Not that I do n't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me
He was working on something called Project Manticore which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human a warrior an advanced infantry soldier
I do n't know what kind of game you 're playing here but I 'm out because you are a whack-job
You did go through my stuff
L-Triptophane a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures Then the lightbulb went off
C'mon Max First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you 're Rocky the flying squirrel Then I found this in your apartment
You lost me
The other one like you
The other ones
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about
Expensive gifts surprise late-night visits over-the-top flattery You always come on this strong
No I meant this
Gold leaf art nouveau French early nineteen hundreds I could probably fence this for three or four grand
C'mere I want to show you something
You need to get out more
I have n't been able to get you off my mind
You 'd think a guy who 's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl
I 'm sorry It was n't my intention But I had to see you
Yes on all counts
Look if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out
We are not fine
It 's alright Peter we 're fine
Whoa there Tex We 've been through all this
You 're that nervous you 're welcome to stay here
How 'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo 's probably touched everything I own
That would be appropriate yes
Am I s'posed to be grateful
So saw my hands off I left you a present
How do I know you did n't
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear
Bent
Bent
Completely different situation I steal things in order to sell them For money It 's called commerce But some stranger sneaking into a girl 's bedroom is bent
Me You 're the one who tried to rip off this piece
You got a lotta nerve
It was open
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with was n't bad enough but breaking into my apartment
I 'm not a half bad cook
I wo n't be staying
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time
Yeah
Is the social studies class over for today
You accept the way things are you 're an active participant in making it worse
Personally I 'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I ca n't do anything about
Something
So what are you gon na do about it
People had a choice even if they took it for granted And now they do n't
You miss the good ol days Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they did n't have to And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat Those good ol days
Look around at all this Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared They blinked and before they knew it they 'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands Overnight the government the police everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them
So what you just like the sound of your own voice
Fortunately my needs are met in that department
What 's your shot in all this Being a famous anonymous underground pirate cyber-journalist ca n't be much of a payday
One of my sources Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa
Girlfriend
Lauren 's not my wife
How does Mrs Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody 's hit list
Too early to tell
So now you tracked me down What d'ya think
Now you know who I am where I live I figured I better find out who I 'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention
Was n't that hard
How 'd you find me
The one you 're wearing
Lem me get my coat
Can we go somewhere and talk
Sorry about your window
Logan Cale
Original Cindy say hi to my good friend
We did n't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night
So this guy walks into a bar and says
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses eye of Ra protector avenger and destroyer giver of life who lives forever I could keep going
Who is
No because it 's the Egyptian goddess Bast
So what you liked it because it was shiny
Whoever that is
You have good taste French 1920 's attributed to Chitarus
We 're just a little tense right now It 's okay
I 'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time
You 're lucky I almost pulled the trigger
Guess it was n't the pizza delivery guy
I was expecting someone else
First time I ever heard that
Thank God
Girl 's got ta make a living
You 're a thief
I 'll wait
None
Any idea when she 'll be back
Max something I got no clue where she stays
Ca n't help you
I need to talk to her
She may be easy on the eyes but she 's trouble trust me Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme
But she does work here
You do n't want to
Know where I can find her
Ladies would be elsewhere
I 'm looking for a lady who works here
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again
I understand
Say the words I understand
Okay okay
Now here 's how it 's gon na be Lydia You 're gon na take your threats and your acrylic nails and you 're gon na go home and figure out your marriage instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do understand
Help Lem me go No do n't let me go Help
Let go of my hand
This is not a place you wan na go
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch I decide when I 'm done with your boyfriend Not him and certainly not you Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are
I think you should go now
You 're also a fool
Big part of loving someone 's being able to forgive them
How sweet Standing by your man even after what he did You 're a very understanding person
Well it 's over between you and him We 're getting married next month
Oh
And so should you Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you I know all about how you threatened him That if he did n't break it off with me you 'd save him the trouble
I thought it was important for you to know the facts
Look I do n't know what you want
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately That 's so you wo n't see the fingernail marks on his back Bet you did n't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting He did n't either at first
How do I know you 're telling the truth
With me where he 's been after work three sometimes four nights a week for the last two months We have what you might call an intimate relationship
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night
My name 's Lydia And it seems you and I have a lot in common
Who are you
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late
What do you want
A friend of your fiance 's
Who is it
I 'm on my way
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma
Just give it to me I 'll remember
Got a pencil
Zero C'mon Dan I do n't have all day
Just do it Five-seven-five-oh eight
Sure you wan na be havin this conversation over the phone
I need a favor I need you to trace a number for me
You and me both
I 'm sorry I could n't come up with something more positive
Bastard
Your fiance has four previous wives His M.O is to clean 'em out and take off Which is what you oughta do
I 'm you I take that money and get outta town while you can
You 're crazy
Hardware 's too sophisticated It 's got ta be the government And why do I think they 're looking for you
Like you said maybe somebody 's tracking one of your investigations
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery But there 's a bug in my computer keyboard a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture
How 's this about me
Whoever tossed this place wants you And I 'm looking to stay outta the line of fire
Here 's your money
I do n't know what your story is and I do n't want to
I 'll live Regarding your case I 'm afraid I 've come up with some bad news on your fiance Lem me get the file
As long as you 're okay
More money Like I 'm shocked to hear you say that
Nothing so far from arrests hospital admissions or coroners This kind of search it 's heavy spadework I 'm gon na need
You were gon na run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks
They do n't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar codes on their necks which is something I 'm not even going to ask about
What about the other kids You get anything on them
Only a last name would be nice Or the nearest town to this clinic
She was a nurse She must 've lived near there somewhere near the the clinic There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven whose last name you do n't even know Maybe if you could give me something more on her anything you can remember some detail
Nothing on Hannah
Then what That 's it That 's all I got
Then what
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine
He says he got it from a woman Does n't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove
Thank you
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food no bill of sale or nothing It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped So we do n't get anything on the seller Except I actually managed to find this guy six hours on the phone Say thank you
Who 's this guy This is n't who we 're looking for her name was Hannah
Sorry I was seven at the time
I got a hit on the car An oh-five Tahoe blue with Wyoming tags AGT349 It was n't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers
Right here someplace
My name 's not kid It 's client As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle Now you got something for me or not
You got a punk-ass mouth on you kid
Yeah does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin on here
You drive away business roarin in like that
You did
I asked you to keep that thing outside
But of course there 's nothing self serving in that scenario
CINDY I say hang the bastard out to dry let her see him for the heel he is then maybe she 'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain
Besides think of the drama I 'm sparing Natalie
CINDY Only one I can think of
They do n't have a lot of moving parts
CINDY So are dogs
They 're prisoners to their genes
CINDY Please
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes
CINDY Friends do n't help other friends cheat
And because he 's my friend
CINDY Unlikely
Yeah 'cause maybe he 's learned his lesson
CINDY You 're actually gon na bail Sketchy out
It 's a secret
CINDY Where
Got ta go
CINDY More like a mystery Which is n't bad It 's just kinduv mysterious
A fog bank
CINDY And back at ya Only there 's a part of you that 's I do n't know
Because you 're probably my closest friend in the whole world
CINDY Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right
A long time
CINDY How long you and me known each other
If I knew what you were saying I would n't be asking
CINDY You know what I 'm saying
A little what
CINDY Hell yeah There 's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little
Yeah
CINDY He was just trying to blame you 'cause he 's a slut
No
CINDY You 're not seriously buying into Darren 's nonsense
Tell me the truth Am I a female fog bank
CINDY What
That 's odd
I just do n't go in with any expectations
CINDY You 're way more philosophical than I could ever be
What guys do 'Nother order
CINDY Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him
CINDY Shame wastin a girl like that on a guy but what 're you gon na do
Straight
CINDY Now why ca n't I find a girlfriend like that Brings him lunch everyday thoughtful sweet legs from here to there
CINDY No but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day know what I 'm saying
At least he did n't swing with your ride
CINDY Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes So now I got ta get my wheels fixed
Morning Sunshine
Okay idea Compromise right Bruno here comes with me He holds the money until mommy shows up then we close escrow What you do with her after I 'm gone does n't keep me awake nights
You get it when I get her
Can you put that in a bag or something
She 's gon na want to hear for herself
She 's got my word
She 's gon na need to know that her little girl 's alright
Make the call
I have sincere eyes
And she bought that
I told her it 's just business to you that all you want is a reasonable solution to this You give her daughter back she agrees to leave the country I play the guarantor drive her down to Mexico tonight and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever
So how do you get the woman to come to me
Pull the cash
Look you 're a player I 'm bringing you this on a plate and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business
What you gon na put me on your Christmas card list
Who are you
You 're gon na pay me fifty thousand dollars
I actually know how this works
Only way you 're ever gon na find out is reincarnation Fact is you are gon na pay me and I am gon na provide you with a service
Quite a mouth on a girl so young but my guess is talking is not what it does best
Right after you change your wardrobe your personality and drop about thirty pounds
Not right now Okay when
Not right now
I 'll bet you can Sit
Yeah I can see to it your winning streak continues
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow
Tell everybody hey
Here 's the dealio on Eyes Only He 's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment bored stupid So he gets off on scarin the poop outta folks like you I got ta go
What if he 's on the level
Do n't believe everything you hear on TV
I know what I got Max They put me back on that drug they 're giving the other vets Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff 's no good
Probably a touch of what 's going around
Feel like the dog 's dinner
Playing hooky again
You 're the best Maxie
It 's payday need me to pick up your check
Shut-up
That was extreme Did you see that one guy
Say the words I understand
Okay okay okay
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish And if I ever find out you 're going out the back door on Natalie again you 're the one who 's gon na be hanging by your ankles three stories up Understand
True but
None of this would 've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint which you did n't
She was the one
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she 's the villain in the piece You are
She 's toxic monster in bed but toxic
Lydia may not have been one of humanity 's finer specimens but
No I 'm serious That psycho got exactly what she deserved Yes
Easy Sketchy
You rock Max You Rock
You do n't
Max what did I do to deserve a friend like you
I 'll give it my best shot
She came by the apartment once already Fortunately I 'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution Lydia 's not gon na back off until she gets her pound of flesh
And we 're sure Lydia 's gon na make her move
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo
How 'd you get her out of town
I just do n't want Natalie to ever find out She deserves better
Or I dissolve into an angry hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again which is probably what would really happen
But you explain that you 're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me
a philandering pig
She tells you how I 've been
You set up on Lydia When she 's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie
So you 're straight on how this is gon na go down
Look Max I made a terrible mistake One I 'll never ever make again Natalie and I are soulmates I know that now She 's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that
And why should she
Even if she does n't dump me which is unlikely she 'd never be able to trust me again
What happens if you level with her
Who either does n't care or could have me killed Either way Natalie 's still gon na find out
Fight fire with fire Threaten to go to her husband
She 's as much as said so But she does n't want to share her toy with anyone else It 's just an ego thing with her
A toy
I 'm a toy to her
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way
Lydia
Does this person have a name
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie Now this person 's demanding I blow her off or she 'll do it for me by telling Nat about us
Then a sympathetic mouth then a sympathetic
Exactly
And you were a sympathetic ear
Hear me out This person I 've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married
Really
I 'm the victim here
Here it comes The part where the guy turns everything around
But there 's another side
You left out condescending
Lame self-serving arrogant guilty as charged
Or do you think we 're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we 'll look the other way which is arrogant and condescending
Max
Do guys actually believe their lame self serving excuses
I know what you 're thinking But the truth is this other person is not someone I 'm in love with As a matter of fact after what she just did she 's not even someone I like much So in a technical sense I 'm not sure you could call me and her cheating officially
I do n't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me
Not half as pissed as she 's gon na be when she finds out why I blew her off I need your help Max
You blew off your girlfriend last night even though it was the big one-oh I 'd be pissed off too if I was her
What 's up
We got ta talk
Hey Sketchy
But I 'll take a rain check
Right the big one-oh
I got ta meet Natalie for dinner
Quitting time Grab a cold one
Later
Catch you back at the wall
Theo 's dead
Hot run to 842 Beulah corner of Haight And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired Not that he cares but the wife and kid might
I 'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I 'm not feeling so hot
What about this
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I was n't feeling so hot
Fourteen-thirteen Market Get a signature then take it to this address By the way that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already
I do n't know how to break this to you Normal we 're all looking for another job
You tell Theo he 's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job
How 'bout you do n't break my sneakers on this The guy is seriously not well
For a change
He 's sick
And Theo ca n't pick up his own check because
I do n't sleep Theo asked me to pick up his check
More like deployed in bed asleep
What 's the difference if I 'm on call here or deployed in the field
I want you on call here
I was on call
This is a hot run Beat it You 're late
I 'm not paying you for the lovemaking Hawk I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer
Amanda as ironic as this is gon na sound I ca n't take any money for I 'm no Midnight Cowboy y'know It would only cheapen the whole deal for me
Well shame on him if he does n't
He 's a little spoiled but I know he does
And he loves you back does n't he
More than anything in the world
No I mean you love your son
I just told you he 's a big hairy
You love him
Believe it or not you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband the champion of lousy lovemaking The man who thinks he 's the biggest and the best The man who thinks every secretary stewardess and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor The man for whom faking it was invented Christ if I had n't gotten pregnant with our son I would have never known I even had sex with the prick
Well Amanda this has been quite a night So far you 've seen me and my dick throw up What 's next Projectile diarrhea Man What a stud huh
My name 's not Woody it 's Haw-haw
Well Obviously no one you have to worry about Woody
Who 's Whiskey Dick
Better ease up then Hawk Would n't want to give you whiskey dick would we
Whoa Some of this hard liquor 's a tad too manly for me I 'm a brewski man myself
Gin
What the hell is that
I 'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you 'd get in a position and spend some time on me
Huh
Do n't be so glum Hawk The night 's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities
Right well thanks for the drinks and stuff Amanda but there 's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore
You 're too kind I 'm Amanda
Thanks miss
Look people undress in public because A they 're exhibitionists B they 're nutcases or C they need the money I can tell you 're not A and I hope to hell you 're not B So my suggestion is think about why you 're a C and let your body party shake your groove thing boogie oogie oogie till you just ca n't boogie no more
I-I c-ca n't
You 're not gon na chicken out on me now are you We 've got your KISS song playing and everything
Oh Dicky I c-c-ca n't
Amanda Finch Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt She like 'em young And since you look a little new at this let me give you three words of advice Hard to get Think it act it know it be it Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games
Whoa she is a killer
Save your money stud muffin The lady at the end of the bar sends her love
Sure I have But not one with ice in it that 's all

Let 's not think about the past Let 's just think about from today on I 'll never forget you Jam
I feel like such an idiot Why did n't I just say something a year and a half ago Man think of how much time we wasted
That 'd be great Hey maybe someday your band 'll play there It 's a college town you know
Nah Once I get my own wheels I could come up all the time
Ann Arbor is n't that far from Cleveland right
My dad 's company is relocating him We 're moving That 's why I was acting so freaky in school today I thought it was the last time I 'd ever see you Anyway open the box I would have given it to you this morning except like I said I was freaking out
Ann Arbor
I have all your notebook doodles memorized Jam Here
Peter Criss is my inspiration man If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo I 'd consider it money Hey how 'd you know that
Your man is the drummer Peter Criss right
I dunno I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther I 'm not too up on Gene trivia
So Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow 's tongue grafted onto his real one Y'know to make it so long
Oh screw it
Right slow
We 've got to take this slow
You do n't know how long I 've been waiting to hear that Jam
Beth I ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how I 've always felt about you Call me Jam It 's my band name
I 've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you Jeremiah I 've just always been too scared to show it
I do n't care I wan na hear more
I did n't mean for that to be so intense Forgive me
Believe it
Beth I ca n't believe it
Yeah
Jeremiah
It 's okay
Sorry
Thanks
No problem
Whatever stella

Waitaminit dudes I got it We find four really small kids beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets What do you think

I have one question How could a kid who wails on the drums like it 's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say
Oh I 'll remember it till the day I die His name was Simpleton the Simian No Samson Samoan No simply similar
What was that D.J 's name again
Disco blows dogs for quarters

What 's in Sandusky
Let 's stop in Sandusky Hawk
Totally All I 've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo
I 'm starvin and it 's way past lunchtime
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know Just had to make it a little more complicated so he 'd understand
Just for the record I understood the last part of what you said but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever
Well the least we his only buds in the world can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence
Our band Mystery is a quartet and we ca n't go on the road without our drummer Jam 's mom said something about sending him to St Bernard 's right We got ta bust him out before we go anywhere
Namely
Stan Lee could n't think of a better one
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit but we 're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario
Maybe some tunage 'll chase those blues away
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this
For once Lex is right It 's over Things ca n't get any worse from here
Yeah
What are you high
Nah Could n't be
No You do n't think
Tickets
I found the Volvo
Still too risky for my money We 're running out of time here This is KISS A victory for one is a victory for the team I 'm sure I can barter with a scalper but if you dudes think you got better plans go for it We 'll reconvene at that intersection
Okay one of us sneaks in gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience comes back out and we all re-enter the concerto Voila
Four dudes sneaking in We 'd get busted fer sure Bad plan
I think we should try sneaking in
Okay shut the fuck up Lex Now then step number one we find us a scalper I got twenty-five
Holy shit I am in absolute trouble I never should have let you drive man Absolute fuckin trouble
Cool bro now listen up
I mean my mom 's got insurance What 's the worst thing she could do Ground me for the entire year I can handle that
Now listen up Here 's the game plan
Wake up Lex This is Detroit The cops are n't gon na waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car Face it the Volvo 's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced diced and julienned by Christine the chop shop gourmet
Here 's a suggestion Let 's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation
DUDES
Now there 's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood
Uh dudes
The paint
What the fuck
Lex am I gon na have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit Do n't worry these babies are built for speed
Jeezis Hawk can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit
Next stop the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car
Gim me a second dudes Lem me think
Now how are we gon na do this
Wait a minute We ditching the rest of school
Ok dudes follow my lead
Curly
Very funny Hawk Okay I 'm in on this hare-brained scheme but if anything happens to my mom 's car I 'm blaming you I 'll say you drugged me or something
Well Jam is in absolute trouble He could n't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse 's ass You know as well as me he 'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss 's drum solo never mind a whole KISS concert check
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity Yeah I 'm vaguely familiar
There 's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just does n't matter anymore Lex You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero
Then lighten up She 'll never know we touched it Alright here 's the plan We bus it to chez Lex grab the Volvo bail Jam the hell outta St Bernard 's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit
Sunday but
And when is she due back from that groinecologist 's convention anyway
Hawk all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati
Damn straight we are
We are not stealing my mom 's car
So Your mom 's car has a CB radar detector and cruise control check
But but St Bernard 's is way the hell over in the next county
Never mind with the too bad shit I got a crazy plan but only the craziest among us can pull it off
Too bad we 're stuck in electronics or
Weird
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life

I 've been in love with her since the second grade
That 's Sherry VanHafton

Excuse me I 'm a little deef-a hearin Can you repeat yourself
Well let 's recap shall we You slapped all of us yelled at me used my head for a rag threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8 track under the wheels of a passing semi So if the lesson was that you 're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut then yes I 'd say we learned it

Are you gettin wise with me
And if it ai n't cleaned off

Hey I invented fake I.D.s alright That 's not the problem They 're playing disco music in there man
Yeah you 're probably too young anyhow
Dude if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it I 'd give it my best shot I 'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time But this tribal ritualistic bullshit it 's way-too-spontaneous for me
Guess you do n't want to see the greatest show on earth And in Detroit no less Well take care chief
I ca n't just walk in and take my clothes off It 's embarrasskin
You look a little scrawny but it 's worth a shot
The easy way
Where the hell am I gon na scare up that kinda gravy in one hour
Sorry man no can do But I 'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy
Dude this is all I got
We all beat each other up then once we 're nice and bruised we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen They got ta let us in then
Go ahead Jam
Well I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak
See you at 8:30 Jam Later Dudes Later

It does n't mean anything Do n't pay attention to him
Well could n't you slow down so I can at least state my case Hawk If you do n't like it you can speed up and I 'll never mention it again
Oh no Jam I 'm not falling for that twice
What Are you mentally deranged Jam
Do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off
Check

Check

I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth Lord have mercy
BRUCE Jeremiah what 's gotten into you
BRUCE Just keep your lying heathenous trap shut Jeremiah
Mom what 're we
BRUCE If you truly are sorry son then you better pray like you 've never prayed before God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it
I said I 'm sorry
BRUCE What
If I 'm anything like you I 'll deserve him
BRUCE Someday you 'll have a son just like you Jeremiah A boy who lies through his teeth buys demonic records and smokes the dope just like you
BRUCE What else can I do Oh records and magazines and comic books are one thing but tickets TICKETS Jeremiah do you realize what this means That you 're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces Now you want to see the devil in the flesh You want to reach out and touch pure evil and in Detroit no less
You mean you 're sending me to b b-boarding school
BRUCE I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St Bernard 's We 're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot
BRUCE You 're a smart boy Jeremiah And so handsome
Grounded for the rest of the year
BRUCE Now do n't forget you 're on the honor system tonight I 'll be home a little after one and if you 've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music well need I remind you of the consequences
They 're not idiots
BRUCE Besides those jeans are so tight I can see your penis
But mom
BRUCE It 's dirty laundry for one thing and for another you still have n't worn the clothes I bought you You 're skating on thin ice already young man so I would n't push my luck Now get out of those rags
Change What 's wrong with what I got on
BRUCE You 're going to be late if you do n't hurry up and change soon
Ahh sunshine
Uhh nothing
BRUCE Jeremiah what are you doing
BRUCE NOW
Oh hi mom
Splendid I love a good game of Name That Nightie
Tell you what You keep guessing and I 'll say something when you get it
A bustier
No Much bet I mean much more sinful than that
Was it a teddy
Okay when she peeled off that gown you 'll never guess what she was wearing underneath
Well Continue Continue
Well she was a very tempting siren Father Built like you would n't believe So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour
Oh this is terrible Please go on
I was insulted so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o right Then she said no she wanted to take a bath with me
No
Alright Father here it is About two weeks ago I went to my cousin 's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath
Okay you better have something really sinful for me this time son My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute
Well then I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets I realize this is Detroit but I personally find what that rock and roll band is all about to be boring as Lucifer 's kingdom I 'll return in a little while
No
Well this is a unique confession to say the least son And not exactly the most interesting one I 've ever heard either You sure you do n't want to talk about oh carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad 's bed
Yeah
That 's it
So you see if it was n't for me me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now together
Just one Father but boy was it a doozy

Fuck you Lex This whole thing would n't have happened if it was n't for you jinxing us I just made an honest mistake
Really Trip can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change
Let 's lift up her shirt

Eyowch This is one hot pizza
Huh St Bernard 's Figures it 's named after a canine
Well here we are back at fucking school again
Hello summer detention
About fuckin time if you ask me I 'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway
Simple-icity is more like it And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before Wait till Mrs Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us
Simplicity Hawk
Yeah I have a saying too Lex It goes Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us asshole We 're going this time and that 's all there is to it
The Chinese have a proverb That which appears too good to be true usually is There 's got ta be a catch

Shrooms And even if it was LSD I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day
Trip a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make And even if it did at least my mom did n't give birth to me while she was on LSD
You 're one to talk Lex Your mom 's a fuckin dyke
Poor Jam man Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers No question Mrs Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen I hope he does n't get grounded again If he misses Peter Criss 's drum solo I do n't know if he 'll be able to handle it
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us
Look I want to live but I do n't know where the fuck I 'm gon na find two hundred bucks
KID You heard me nad breath My time 's precious and I think that 's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life

CUNNINGHAM Now that 's what I like to hear Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears They give in to their feelings of self-doubt they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs alcohol and premarital sex Empty solutions These are toxic chemicals and disease-spreading behaviour
GOOD MORNING
CUNNINGHAM Are you AFRAID
GOOD MORNING
CUNNINGHAM Now that 's better but I still sense some students out there who are AFRAID just to say GOOD MORNING
Good MORNING
CUNNINGHAM That 's all the gusta you can musta I said Good morning
Good morning
CUNNINGHAM Good morning mongrels
Did you know him
Yeah
I feel bad for his family
Donnie Donnie Darko
What was his name
He got smooshed By a jet engine
What happened
Horrible accident My neighbour he got killed
Hi what 's going on here
MONNITOFF Donnie I 'm afraid I ca n't continue this conversation I could lose my job
Not if you chose to stay within God 's channel
MONNITOFF You are contradicting yourself Donnie If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies The very fact that this choice exists would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future And that 's a form of time travel right
MONNITOFF I 'm not following you
If God controls time then all time is pre-decided Then every living thing travels along a set path
MONNITOFF That is highly unlikely You 're talking about an act of God
Could these wormholes appear in nature
MONNITOFF Uhh sure And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal in this case the wormhole or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach
MONNITOFF Beg pardon
Like a spear
MONNITOFF Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time along its centre of gravity
MONNITOFF Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness That darkness is part of their natural development
Well the thing is nobody remembers their infancy And anyone who says they do is lying We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life
MONNITOFF What effect do you think this would have on an infant
MONNITOFF A metal craft of any kind
Like a DeLorean
MONNITOFF The basic principles of time travel are there So you have the vessel and the portal And the vessel can be anything Most likely a spacecraft
So that 's it
MONNITOFF A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man
and be able to find one of these wormholes
MONNITOFF Theoretically
So in order to travel back in time you 'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light
MONNITOFF So according to Hawking wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time
I know that this is gon na sound kinda weird but do you know anything about time travel
MONNITOFF Donnie
Dr Monnitoff
Donnie Give it back
The Last Unicorn By Samantha Darko
You 'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this Samantha
I 'm telling Mom
When you fall asleep tonight I 'm gon na fart in your face
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie He stinks
Not until like eighth grade
When can I squeeze one out
Our saviour
What did you say
Dea ex machina
You know what I think that you did it
Well if you 're innocent then you have nothing to worry about
That 's not what I heard Now they think I did it
I did n't say shit
Did you tell them that I flooded the school
You should already know that Watch the movie Donnie I have something to show you
How much longer is this gon na last
It is the name of my father and his father before me
Why do they call you Frank
I am so sorry
What happened to your eye
Take it off I want to see you
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit
Yeah Tell me why you 're wearing that stupid bunny suit
You have a request
You have to do something for me first
I want to show you something
Do you believe in time travel Donnie
Where did you come from
You 'll know soon enough
Who is we
We just want to guide you in the right direction
Why did you make me flood the school
I can do anything I want and so can you
How can you do that
Go home Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine
What 'd you do Donnie What 'd you do
A hundred and one I think Every day she does the same thing But there 's never any mail
How old is Grandma Death
I do n't wan na talk about it
My dad said he found you on the golf course Are you sleepwalking again
We went to a hotel
DARKO CHEATS DEATH Man you 're famous I called you like a jillion times last night
Yeah
Is that a cellar door
Who 's Frank
No Frank
Why Is this about the book
Time is running out We have to go see Grandma Death We have to talk to her
Where are we going
Come with me
There 's something you have to know Gretchen Everything is going to be just fine
What
It 's safe here
I 'm so scared I just keep thinking that something awful has happened It 's my fucking stepdad I know it
Yeah they told me to get out of the house
Did you call the cops
But you 're OK
I do n't know She did n't leave a note The house is all messed up
Where is she
My mom is gone
Hey You OK
Hey
Then when I have to talk to you
Not now Donnie It is n't a good time
Will you please talk to me
What do you mean
What 's wrong with you
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge
The whole movie Let 's go
What How long was I asleep
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs And each photograph is of something peaceful or beautiful Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside
Yeah So the idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant and they wear them at night when they sleep
Infant Memory Generators
So we call them IMGs
Maybe she 's asleep
I know she 's here She never leaves the house
She wrote it There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I 've been seeing It ca n't just be a coincidence Will you come see her with me
Oh yeah The Philosophy of Time Travel What is this
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road
Who
I 've been seeing stuff a lot of really messed-up stuff Do you know who Grandma Death is
Are you okay
They suspended me for two days
What
We 're moving through time
Yeah And right now there 's some fat guy over there watching us
I always wanted it to be at a time when when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be
No Donnie wait I 've never
That 's alright I understand
You want to kiss me
Well
And what
You know we 've been going together for a week and a half
Like a Hawaiian sunset the Grand Canyon Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be
With like images
That 's not good enough You 've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them with whatever you wanted
Why not just buy your baby a night light
Babies cry because they 're afraid of the dark And because they have no memories for all they know every night could be the last forever Like perpetual darkness
I do n't want to talk about it So what happened to your neck
What happened to your neck
Well maybe someone is like giving you these dream steroids And sleepwalking is someone showing you the way
Why
Do you ever feel as though there 's always someone watching you
Yeah
Donnie
And you 'd never been there before
No Every time I wake up somewhere different Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge
So when you sleepwalk you go somewhere familiar
It 's like this big force that 's in your brain But sometimes it grows bigger and it spread down into your arms and legs and it just sends you someplace
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker because they could drop dead
No I just wake up and I look around try to figure out where I am how I got there
So when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward Like do you dream
I 'm going home
Where are you going
Sure
No I mean will you GO with me That 's like what they call it here Going together
Where are we going
Will you go with me
That was a compliment
I 'm sorry
You 're weird
We never would have had this conversation
Why is that
It 's a good thing the school was flooded today
Until it withers away
The best thing about soap is that it 's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty No matter what crap you throw on it it always rubs off And there it is again perfect
Wonder where we 'll be then
Do n't knock soap Without it disease would spread rapidly If we ran out you and I would never live to see the year 2000
You mean soap
I mean the whole sanitation thing Joseph Lister 1895 Before antiseptics there was no sanitation especially in medicine
That 's easy Antiseptics
I should go For physics Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind
What makes you think I 'm not
Donnie Darko is a cool name Sounds like a superhero
I 'm sorry I was in jail once I accidentally burned down this house It was abandoned I got held back in school again Ca n't drive until I 'm eighteen I think when I grow up I want to be a painter Or maybe a writer or maybe both Then I 'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book You know change things
He fled They still ca n't find him My mom and I had to change our names and stuff I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool
Wow Did he go to jail
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest
Oh I have those too What kind of problems does your dad have
Yeah My parents got divorced My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad He has emotional problems
So you just moved here
Fuck them
I 'm not But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit
Do n't look so freaked
Sure
Wan na walk me home
School 's cancelled
Hey
Hey
FARMER If you do n't complete the assignment you 'll get a zero for the day
People are n't that simple
Well yeah OK but you 're not listening to me There are other things that need to be taken into account here Like the whole spectrum of human emotion You 're just lumping everything into these two categories and like denying everything else
FARMER Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions
Well life is n't that simple So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet That has nothing to do with either fear or love
FARMER The Lifeline is divided that way
I just do n't get this Everything ca n't be lumped into two categories That 's too simple
FARMER Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline
I 'm sorry Ms Farmer I just do n't get this
It feels wonderful
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son
If I 'm lucky So I wo n't be back until the first Your dad will be back on Sunday so I 've put Elizabeth in charge until then She has the car so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow
Do you get to meet Ed
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow
Fine You know Dr Thurman is n't so bad a lady I can tell her anything
He ca n't Samantha He 's been suspended from after-school activities Donnie are you still with us How was your therapy session tonight
That is a terrible nickname
Grandma Death
Then why do n't you start taking the goddamn pills
You know it would be nice to look at you some time and see my son I do n't recognise this person today
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade Mom Get out of my room
I wish I knew where you went at night Did you toilet paper the Johnson 's house
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table
Oh please tell me Elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck
When did you stop taking your medication
You 're such a fuck-ass
No a year of partying is enough She 'll be going to Harvard this fall
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn 'Cause that 's a great place to raise children
I know I 'm not the best communicator But whatever happens in your life whatever obstacles you come up against you just say and do whatever is in your heart You be honest and tell the truth even if they look at you funny and they will They 'll tell you that you 're wrong They 'll call you a fool But what you 've got to understand son is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit and they 're scared of people like you Because you 're smarter than all of them
I know Dad
You 're my only son
A lot of people Teachers Younger kids It 's like they 're afraid of me for some reason But that 's OK because I know I deserve it
Who 's been giving you weird looks
I guess she just lost faith in the world
You 're right Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time Over the years as she got older she became more and more of a recluse now she just likes to stay up there all by herself
You know Roberta Sparrow We almost hit her with the car the other day
Grandma Death
Grandma Death
Oh shit
You tell Dr Thurman whatever you want
So we 're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows
No apparently they ca n't tell us what happened yet Something about a matching serial number that got burned But I had to sign a form saying I would n't talk to anyone about it
Where it came from
Know what
Do they know yet
Good Lord So the construction guys say it 'll take about a week to fix the roof Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match
It was great We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime And then during show-and tell my stuffed walrus was a big hit
So how was school today
POMEROY Then go find her Donnie Do n't let her get away She was right about the rabbits Go
I think I already have But now she wo n't even talk to me
POMEROY So will Donnie find his Cellar Door
POMEROY Sometimes it 's the only thing that keeps us going
Cellar door
POMEROY A famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language of all the endless combinations of words in all of history that Cellar Door is the most beautiful
What 's Cellar Door
POMEROY Tell them that everything is going to be just fine It is up to the children to save themselves these days Because the parents they do n't have a clue
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you
POMEROY Thank you Donnie And you 're a good student Lazy but a good student Unlike most of the others you question Mom and Dad 's rules
That 's bullshit You 're a good teacher
POMEROY I do n't know That 's a good question but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher They fired me
Where are you going
POMEROY Donnie it 's Friday Should n't you be off with your friends scaring old people
Ms Pomeroy what 's going on
Of course A rabbit is not like us It has no history books it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret I like bunnies and all They 're cute and they 're horny And if you 're cute and horny then you 're probably happy that you do n't know who you are or why you 're even alive But the only thing I 've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die
POMEROY Is the death of one species less tragic than another
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human
POMEROY Because the rabbits are us Donnie
Why should we care
POMEROY And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver 's vision do they believe him It could be the death of an entire way of life the end of an era
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit
POMEROY Who is Frank
Well they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds When they flood the house That like destruction is a form of creation So the fact that they burn the money is ironic They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart They want to change things
POMEROY Donnie Darko perhaps given your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion
THURMAN Goodbye Donald
Goodbye Dr Thurman
THURMAN Donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God You are an agnostic An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God but does not deny the possibility that God exists
Thank you
THURMAN Your medication They 're placebos Just pills made out of water
THURMAN You will survive this Donald I promise you that you will survive You must let me help you And when I clap my hands together you will wake up
It 's too late I 've already ruined my life
THURMAN If the sky were to suddenly open up there would be no law there would be no rule There would only be you and your memories the choices you 've made and the people you 've touched The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged by which you must judge yourself Because when this world ends there will only be you and him and no one else
He 's right there He can read my mind and he 'll show me the way out of this The sky is going to open up and then He will reveal himself to me
THURMAN Where is he Donald
I can see him right now
THURMAN Who is he going to kill
Frank is going to kill
THURMAN What is going to happen
Soon Time is almost up
THURMAN When will this happen
It would have to be God 's portal They will lead me to it Then I will go back in time and I wo n't feel regret anymore
THURMAN Then how is time travel possible
Grandma Death will teach me how Soon
THURMAN How is that possible
I have the power to build a time machine
THURMAN Where are we going Donald
THURMAN Where are we going
I think so I think that 's one of the clues It 's a clue that tells us to keep going
THURMAN God exists because you 're horny
Because I 'm so horny
THURMAN Why
I think now that he might
THURMAN If God exists
I have to obey him because he saved my life He controls me and I have to obey him or I 'll be left all alone and I 'll never figure out what all of this means
THURMAN Why did you do these things Donnie Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes
Yes I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert 's house I think I only have a few days left before they catch me
THURMAN You 've done it again
That I did it again
THURMAN What else makes you feel regret
Regret
THURMAN How did you feel being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos
Hungry Hungry Hippos
THURMAN What did you want for Christmas that year
They did n't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year
THURMAN Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead
Yes I went to jail
THURMAN But you were punished
People get hurt I do n't want to hurt anyone
THURMAN But it was an accident The house was under construction
People get hurt
THURMAN Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world to set the world on fire
I I was playing with fire
THURMAN So your parents why did you disappoint them
Yes
THURMAN And when I clap my hands together twice you will wake up Do you understand
THURMAN Have you ever made love Donald
Yeah you know Fucking
THURMAN The good stuff
I mean Gretchen She wo n't even let me kiss her She says because it 's our first kiss she 's like waiting for this big moment or something I just do n't get it I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff
THURMAN I know
Whoa That 's OK Dr Thurman it 's nothing to be embarrassed about I have sexual fantasies all the time too
You know every week I come in here and I tell you stuff and it 's all embarrassing I tell you stuff that I do n't tell anyone else and you know what It 's your turn Dr Thurman I 'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself
THURMAN Are you embarrassed by these things that you see
Yeah but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank
THURMAN Have you told Gretchen about the spears
Nothing
THURMAN What did you find
It was just like she described them in her book Like they were alive The way that they looked moved smelled They were like workers assigned to each one of us I followed my spear and I found something
THURMAN And they grow out of our stomachs
THURMAN No That makes you keep searching
I 'd like to believe that I 'm not but I 've just never seen any proof So I just choose not to bother with it It 's like I could spend my whole life thinking about it debating it in my head Weighing the pros and cons And in the end I still would n't have any proof So I do n't even debate it any more Because it 's absurd I do n't want to be alone So does that make me like an atheist
THURMAN Do you feel alone right now
No She died when I was eight We could n't find her for days She went and crawled underneath our back porch
THURMAN Is Callie still around
It reminded me of my dog Callie
THURMAN How does that make you feel
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman She wrote a book about time travel Frank asked me if I believed in time travel That ca n't just be a random coincidence My dad almost hit her with the car the other day and she said the creepiest thing She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone
THURMAN A sign from whom
I do n't know Gretchen has a theory That Frank is a sign I told her I thought it was ridiculous
THURMAN Who is they Is Frank part of some larger group
I do n't think so It 's like a TV station And they 're tuned into mine and no one else 's
THURMAN Can anyone else see him
Four times so far
THURMAN How many times have you seen Frank
THURMAN Donnie I want to hear about your friend Frank
No I do n't think about fucking my family That 's sick
THURMAN What about your family Donnie
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano
THURMAN Who is the boss
I think about Who 's the Boss
THURMAN What else do you think about during school
I think about fucking a lot during school
THURMAN I asked you about school
I think about girls a lot
THURMAN How are things going at school
Yes
THURMAN Do you think a lot about girls
Gretchen We 're going together now
THURMAN What is her name
I met a girl
THURMAN So tell me about your day Donald
Yes
THURMAN And when I clap my hands twice you will wake up Do you understand
No That 's stupid
THURMAN Do you believe that the world is coming to an end
Into the future Then he said that the world was coming to an end
THURMAN Follow him where
He said to follow him
THURMAN Frank instructed you to get out of bed just before this happened
A jet engine fell on my house landed on my bed While I was talking to Frank on the golf course
THURMAN I do n't own a television
Do n't you watch the news
THURMAN How so
I think he saved my life
THURMAN Frank
His name is Frank
THURMAN Would you like to talk about this friend
So I met a new friend
THURMAN All of this certainly is n't your mother 's fault Donald
I 've been taking it I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this You know abuse her Psychologically
THURMAN Your mother said that you 've been skipping cycles of your medication
Everything is going to be just fine
Okay but it has to be a small one
Mom and Dad wo n't be back until Sunday night It 's Halloween Carnival We should throw a party We could totally get away with it
Congratulations
I got in I 'm going to Harvard
That 's a nice name OK let me see it
Her name is Gretchen
Yeah well that 's not the way the world works If you keep being too honest the world will eventually find a way to destroy you
I was just being honest
It 's not that I mean mouthing off to your teachers I 'll admit when Dad told me what you said to Ms Farmer I laughed my ass off
Well do n't worry I 'm taking my medication
No I do n't She worries about you
Because you tell Mom everything
Why would I tell Mom
You 're not gon na tell Mom are you
What 's her name
Yeah
So I hear you have a girlfriend
Guess who wrote it
What does time travel have to do with philosophy
It 's called The Philosophy of Time Travel
Maybe you 'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication
Whoa Elizabeth A little hostile there Maybe you should be the one in therapy Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts so we wo n't have to
Well I think you 're the fucking Anti-Christ
CUNNINGHAM I think you are afraid to ask me for advice I think that you are a very troubled confused young man I think you 're searching for answers in all the wrong places
Well Jim I think you 're full of shit
CUNNINGHAM Well Gerald I think you 're afraid
Gerald
CUNNINGHAM Excuse me What 's your name son
How much are they paying you to be here
THURMAN But let me remind you that this treatment is experimental
If that 's what you think is necessary
THURMAN I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy and increase his medication
I What can we do
THURMAN He has described lengthy conversations physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind
You 're telling me my son has an imaginary friend
THURMAN Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination
Frank
THURMAN Frank the giant bunny rabbit
Come again
THURMAN Has your son ever told you about Frank
Well you know about his past And when you said to look for signs of aggression He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher
THURMAN What I think is going on with your son
Thank you for seeing us We just felt that it was time to discuss
He died remember On the way to the prom He was doomed
He was a year ahead of us
Frankie Feedler You remember him from high school
What
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound
So let me get this straight No airline will claim ownership of the engine So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof Fuck that We 're taking the money out of savings
You 're not a bitch
Our son just called me a bitch
Do n't worry Mom Just go you 'll miss your flight
Here are the keys to the Taurus There 's plenty of groceries in the fridge And I left money on the kitchen table And do n't forget
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet He knows you check the container
It is a big deal
I did n't realise it was such a big deal
How did you know
No I took a year off to be with you Of course I care Do n't get angry What
You can suck a fuck
That 's enough
Did you just call me a fuck-ass
Donnie You 're a dick
Excuse me
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out then I think you 're misinformed
I have n't been accepted yet mother
I guess they made him do it
COLE How did this happen
Yep
COLE Christ Is that an axe
What else Shit Principal Cole you ai n't gon na believe what else
COLE What else
I got twelve classrooms full of water All coming from a busted water main
FARMER Rose I do n't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters This has been a dream of ours for a long time Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion
Oh Kitty I do n't know This is so last-minute Eddie is in New York
FARMER Yes And believe me of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you given the predicament with your son But none of the other mothers are able to go
But now you ca n't go
FARMER Rose I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning And as you know the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning Now as their coach I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip
Beg pardon
FARMER Please Do n't say those words Well as you can see many of us are devastated by this news This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest which involves you
Yes I saw the news Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon
FARMER Rose we have a crisis I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham
Kitty
FARMER Rose
FARMER Rose I 'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN But after witnessing your son 's behaviour today I have significant doubts Our paths through life must be righteous I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear
Kitty I do n't know what to say They 've suspended him for two days Ever since this jet fiasco I honestly do n't know what has gotten into him
FARMER I think we 've all seen Bonanza
Do you even know who Graham Greene is
FARMER The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school 's curriculum
Excuse me but what is the real issue here The PTA does n't ban books from school
FARMER I AM THE PTA And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism
COLE This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation
FARMER And how do they do this They FLOOD the house by breaking through the water main
FARMER The bottom line Mr Cole is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour
COLE Kitty
FARMER Mr Cole not only am I a TEACHER but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child Therefore I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge
COLE Kitty I would appreciate if you could wait

Chicolini you 've come just in time We need a man who 's fearless brave A man who 's willing to die if necessary
He 's working very hard I got him a job driving Firefly 's car He's-a driving him crazy and I 'm driving him nuts P-E-A-N-U-T-S
Fine keep on yelling Do everything you can to disturb Firefly Now what about your cousin
How 'm I doing boss
The population must increase With great rapidity We give a couple seven years To raise a family If by that time there is no branch Upon the family tree we stand 'em up against the wall and Pop goes the Weasel
The husband steps outside Relinquishes his bride We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride
If any man should come between A husband and his bride We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide If she prefers the other man The husband steps outside We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel
So everyone beware Who 's crooked or unfair No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share
I will not stand for anything that 's crooked or unfair I 'm strictly on the up and up So everyone beware If anyone 's caught taking graft And I do n't get my share we 'll stand 'em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited I 'll put my foot down So shall it be This is the land of the free The last man nearly ruined this place He did n't know what to do with it If you think this country 's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it The treasury is low on dough The last man went and flew with it If you think we 're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it The country 's taxes must be fixed And I know what to do with it If you think you 're paying too much now Just wait 'till I get through with it
If we should choose to chew we 'll be pursued
If chewing gum is chewed The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden
We 're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL HAIL FREEDONIA
Tired I 'd like to stretch this into a week
Are you sure you 're not tired
Not at all When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water
Are you getting tired
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age
I shall dance for you tonight as I 've never danced before
Yes but I 'll talk to you about that when we 're alone
Oh Your Excellency is n't there something I can do
Carry out this tragic folly if you will But I for one will not be a part of it I will stay here in Freedonia
You keep that up and you 'll crab the whole war
You could n't hang me in your bedroom I 'll make a note of it Where 's my secretary
Your Excellency please do n't think me silly but I 'd love to have a picture of you I want to hang it in my bedroom
I still like UPSTART the best
Why er Mrs Teasdale this is an outrage This man is impossible My course is clear this means war You RUNT
That 's it
Oh yes UPSTART
No it was a seven letter word
Was it swine
No that was n't it
Oh you mean worm
I do n't remember
What I called you Why what did I call you
Nothing doing I 've taken a lease on the battlefield I 'd lose my deposit besides I 've already ordered the ammunition
I am willing to apologize I 'm willing to do anything to prevent this war
Forget You ask me to forget Why my ancestors would rise from their graves and I 'd only have to bury them again A Firefly never forgets
I 'm sorry we lost our tempers I 'm willing to forget if you are
THEN IT 'S WAR
Bah
How 're ya fixed for ammunition
Yes
Then it 's war
That 's it No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart
You upstart
Once more
You worm
Give me that again
You swine
That 's what you think
Well why not say the least and get it over with
This has gone far enough This interruption is humiliating to say the least
What can this mug offer you Wealth and family I ca n't give you wealth but we can have a little family of our own
Ca n't we go some place where we can be alone
When you get through with her feet you can start on mine I have n't been to a chiropodist in two years If that 's not an insult I do n't know what is Gloria I love you I
And Vera niece too
You do n't understand This is my niece Vera
Go ahead
Excellency may I present my niece
Why yes I met you at the dog races say you could have won that race if you tried a little harder
Your Excellency have n't we met before
I 'll tell you what I 'll do I 'll give you Mrs Teasdale as security or my jackknife If you want my advice you 'll take the jackknife I 've a better proposition Make it 25 and I 'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose
50
Well in the meantime could you let me have 50 personally
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum I 'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance
I 'll keep the greetings but you can send back the good will what we need right now is twenty million dollars
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people
That 's even a greater honor
TEASDALE The king can do no wrong
You know I think they think I should be king Although it would please me to govern the throng suppose I were king and then everything went wrong
You satisfied your selfish whims while nations tottered dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion Not bad eh
TEASDALE But
THIS IS TREASON What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms
TEASDALE I said I suspect the Secretary of War
Do n't bother me I 'm thinking What was that
TEASDALE I I may be wrong but I suspect the Secretary of War
WHAT
TEASDALE My purse has been stolen the plans of war are in it
That 's all right I 'll fix you right up
TEASDALE Your Excellency something terrible has just happened
Take a seat you 're next
TEASDALE I hope I 'm not interrupting
You can call me Gloria too Gloria what a beautiful name When I was born my mother named me Gloria two minutes later she found out her mistake
TEASDALE Why why of course
Gloria may I call you Gloria
TEASDALE Oh your Excellency you take me off my feet
Well they might come better but they do n't come any bigger and the bigger the better The bigger the betta you 've got on a horse the more you lose and speaking about horses why do n't you marry me Come come say yes and you 'll never see me again I 'll go 'way if it means your happiness
TEASDALE Now er
Guard them with your life do n't leave them out of your sight If the enemy gets those papers we 're lost If they do n't get them we 're lost Ca n't you see what I 'm trying to tell you I love you Mrs Teasdale you 're the salt of the earth They do n't come any better than you
Well maybe I am a little headstrong But you know it 's awfully hard to forget what he called me
TEASDALE Oh wo n't you reconsider
Let him patch up his own breeches
TEASDALE But Your Excellency the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit He came to ask you to patch up the breach
So you 've come to ask for clemency I 'll give the enemy no quarter not a dime
I would n't know what to say either if I was in your place Maybe you can suggest something
TEASDALE Oh Your Excellency I do n't know what to say
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head
TEASDALE Oh Rufus
He did I told my son not to leave it laying around Where is son
TEASDALE Why that 's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg
I wrote a speech last night that 'll knock them off their seats Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
TEASDALE Your Excellency you must n't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives Have you got your speech ready
That 's what I get for dressing in a hurry
TEASDALE You 've made a wonderful impression Your views are liberal It is easy to see you have an open mind
These are the laws of my administration No one 's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke And whistling is forbidden
TEASDALE If it 's not asking too much For our information just for illustration Tell us how you intend to run the nation
Well a gal a day is enough for me I could n't handle any more
TEASDALE Your Excellency the eyes of the world are upon you Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor This is a gala day for us
You 're not so bad yourself Mrs Teasdale when I look at you I can see that we 're facing a crisis We 've got to balance the budget we 've got to cut down everything including you
TEASDALE Your Excellency
No wonder he passed away I 'd like to be with you to the very end Ca n't you see what I 'm trying to tell you I love you
TEASDALE Why er my husband passed away I was with him to the very end
I have n't been on the job five minutes and already she 's making advances to me Not that I care but where is your husband
TEASDALE The future of Freedonia rests upon you Promise me you will follow in my husband 's footsteps
Well I wo n't stand for much And I wo n't stand for you if you do n't show some improvement soon Look at your report card last month D in spelling six in behavior Now who were the six A fine state of affairs no wonder you ca n't matriculate now what were you saying
TEASDALE In choosing you I feel that I serve my country well I heartily endorse everything you stand for
You can keep it I 've got a whole pack Now what were you saying
TEASDALE What 'll I do with this card
For you I would do anything
TEASDALE Oh would you
Mrs Teasdale I 'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency
TEASDALE This is terrible
I shall report this indignity the my President Mrs Teasdale I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war
I did n't come here to be insulted
TEASDALE Gentlemen Gentlemen
Gloria I 've waited for years I wo n't be put off I love you I want you Ca n't you see that I 'm at your feet
TEASDALE Well no not exactly but
Oh Then there his somebody else
TEASDALE Ambassador Trentino I am indeed honored But you see well I
but would further cement the relations of our countries
Mrs Teasdale no matter who rules Freedonia to me you will always be the first lady of the land
TEASDALE Ambassador I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator
What is money Mrs Teasdale for you I would do anything
TEASDALE Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis Without his country 's financial aid
Perhaps he will listen to you
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason
Maybe you can still win the old dame over why not try to
Fine nothing I did n't want war My plan was to marry Mrs Teasdale and overthrow Firefly
I thought everything was working out fine
This is all Firefly 's fault that idiot that fool
It is every woman 's problem Who supplies the sons the brothers the husbands Who
My dear niece I must ask you not to interfere War is not a woman 's problem
Uncle you ca n't do this
That 's where you come in I 'll leave him in your hands and do n't forget you 're supposed to be my niece
Maybe it 's not going to be so easy From what I 've heard Mrs Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T Firefly
With Mrs Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control
So that 's the one you want to marry
If only I could find her If only she could see me now here with such lovely kind friends You Mrs Treves and you Mr Treves Then maybe she would love me as I am I 've tried to hard to be good
Oh no Mr Merrick No No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment
She has the face of an angel She was an angel She was so kind so kind to me It 's not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant I 'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her
Oh why Mr Merrick she 's beautiful
Oh yes
I 've always thought that myself
They have noble faces
How lovely
And here is one of Frederick 's mother
Oh
Oh yes You have so many nice things and so much room
Two please
One or two
Yes please two
Mr Merrick sugar
Oh Frederick
Am I a good man or am I a bad man
Frederick just what is it that you are saying
But why did I do it What was this all for So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort Or so I could become famous
Oh that 's absurd Frederick No no Frederick that 's all wrong John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life And that is completely due to you
That I am very little different from him
Oh Freddie What could that wretched vampire say to upset you
Oh I 've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said
Freddie What 's the matter You 've been like this all evening
Hmmm
More romances for John
Dinner will be served shortly dear
You stay with me
And here are my mother and father
Yes
Do you
John loves the house
I 've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon when Carr Gomm meets him Somehow between now and then I 've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man Why am I fooling myself Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm
Well these things take time
I 'm sorry I do n't know either I just do n't know
I 'm sure I do n't know Freddie
And what qualities are those Intelligence or stupidity
Perhaps you 're just polishing a stone endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he does n't possess
I do n't know I ca n't explain it If this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then I 'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best I can to help him live as full and content a life as possible But If he 's an imbecile who 's body I ca n't treat and who 's mind I ca n't touch well then my obligation is discharged They can put him where they will he wo n't be bothered I wo n't be bothered and everyone 's conscience can remain free and untroubled And that is my dilemma what is in his mind
Frederick why are you so interested in this particular case
He is I mean I 've always thought he was I think he must be Is he simple Or is that just something I 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself
But I thought you said that he was rather simple
Well I was n't sure whether he was parroting me because that 's all he was capable of or whether he sensed that that 's all I wanted to hear and he was trying to please me
What do you mean
I should n't be We made great progress today I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases He did rather well too but I had to lead him every step of the way Though frankly at times I was unsure of who was leading whom
Freddie Freddie do n't look so discouraged
No I think a whiskey
Yes and they send their kisses Would you like your sherry now
Yes very well I think Are the girls in bed
Did it go well darling
I 'll join you shortly
You wo n't be long
I 'll get my bag
Like this
What is it
Our man is sick Come right away
Did you see it
I found it
Yes
Excuse me Mr Treves sir
Shut up
Do n't
I 'll show you I 'll show you
What are you going to do
If he does it 's his own fault But I 'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh
He 's sick Bytes He 's going to die
He 's doing it to spite me I tell you and it 's got to stop
Aw Bytes he 's sick
You sly bastard You 're doing this to spite me are n't you
Right Right
Now I think we really do understand one another
I 've got my rights damn you and I 'm going to the authorities
So you can beat him So you can starve him A dog in the street would fare better with you
I want him back
You do n't own this man
You think you 're better n me YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself you guv So I gave him to you On trust in the name of science And now I want him back
All you do is profit from another man 's misery
He 's a freak That 's how they live We 're partners him and I business partners You 're willfully deprivin me of my livlihood
I know what you 've done to him and he 's never going back to that
Pull the other one why do n't you We made a deal
You misunderstood This man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning He 's my patient now and I must do what
DO N'T Do n't muck me about You 've had plenty of time to fix him up and he 's leaving with me NOW Do you understand me Now Mr Treves We had a bargain
He 's still very sick Please come downstairs with me I 'll explain the situation
Never mind that I want my man
Just a moment how did you get in here
I want my man back
Everything will be seen to
I like doing business with you You and I understand each other completely I know I can trust you Ca n't I
You listen you 're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies He 's got the rale he 's very weak and I do n't know how much damage has been done by his fall Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab
Ca n't you fix him up here He 's my livelihood Listen
This man belongs in hospital
That 's the way he sleeps If he lays down he 'll die Head 's too heavy
Why is he sitting up like this He needs rest
He 's a clumsy git Never watches where he is going
He must have taken quite a fall
He fell He falls
What happened
I intend to
He was fine when he left here and now look at him
What do you mean
What did you do to him He 's been like this all night
Steady on Treves Have a seat
Do n't you think this is a bit premature We do n't have the backing yet to
Please do
Well I 'll let you know if there 's something in the afternoon post
But he 's so afraid he 's going to be carted off I 've promised him that wo n't happen
Frankly Treves it 's not what I 'd expected A few small cheques Well wishers Do n't worry these things undoubtedly take time
Has the response picked up
Well it 's up to us then is n't it
No we do n't Their committees have informed me that they 're unwilling to take Mr Merrick even if they were supplied with funds They do n't want him
Do n't we
Of course they will They 're reasonable men
Do you think they 'll go along with us
Excellent We shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee I want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities
Well yes
No not that way Broadneck and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly It makes them queasy Do you have any photographs of Mr Merrick
I could easily arrange
You are quite right Treves this is an exceptional case And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr Merrick
No you ca n't You ca n't begin to know no one can
Yes I think I can
Can you imagine what his life has been like
Not me sir Mr Merrick He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness
Treves Well done
Tell me John how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm
I do n't understand
How did you know the rest I never taught you the rest of it
I 'm sorry too He simply does n't belong here He 's be much happier somewhere else where he could be constantly looked after Believe me Frederick it 's better that it worked out this way Good day
Yes I 'm very sorry to have wasted your time sir I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him
It was a nice try Treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words
And what was that John
Oh yes
Fine fine You know your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing Treves But you must remember that this is a hospital and there are many patients here Patients who can be made well and you owe them your first consideration Just do n't become so obsessed old man that you begin to neglect them
Yes I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables I 'm afraid that they were n't very encouraging but they said they 'd bring it up at their next committee meeting so we should have their answers shortly
He need n't I have no desire to cause him any discomfort Did you make those inquiries we spoke about
As I said it 's only a physical problem but I do feel that Mr Merrick is very flattered that you 're taking the time and trouble to meet him and he 's most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous
Speaking is one thing Treves but can the man comprehend
It 's only a physical problem He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth But he can talk and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying just tell me and I 'll make it clear
Yes Sir
Two o'clock then you know Treves It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance
Wh whatever is most convenient for you sir
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon
Thank you very much Sir Shall we say in a few days then
Singularly unpleasant chap uh I do n't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient Mr Treves
Mr Treves it 's out of the question I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do I 'm sorry
Then will you meet him as a representative of the committee
No Treves it 's out of the question Now if it was up to me I 'd say Certainly let 's meet the fellow by all means I 'm sorry I simply ca n't speak for the other members of the committee
I do n't agree No one can make a reasonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met
I really do n't think that 's necessary Treves I 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are
Well sir perhaps I should explain
A few words I thought he was imbecile
He 's doing very well In fact that 's why I came to see you I think that if I were to present Mr Merrick to the hospital committee then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease but of the man as well If the committee had a chance to speak with him hear him say a few words for himself I 'm sure they would see him as a patient rather than as a violation of the rules
Good How is the patient
Ah no sir I had planned to see them in the morning
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital
Yes sir I 'll look into that Would you like to meet him sir
I certainly sympathize with your problem Treves Why do n't you try the British Home or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him
No more of an acquaintance
Oh is he a friend of yours
Yes I 'm well aware of that But this case is quite exceptional
What are your plans then Treves You are aware that the London does not accept incurables The rules are quite clear on that point
Yes sir
Deformed Is that it Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable
Well sir he 's quite seriously deformed and I fear the other patients would find him rather shocking
Why is n't he in the General Ward then
No sir he 's got bronchitis and he 's been badly beaten
A hospital is no place for secrecy Mr Treves Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment Why was n't this patient properly admitted and why is he in isolation Is he contagious
Indeed
Do n't be frightened He wo n't hurt you
Do n't be mad This muck can kill you
It 's quite nutritious sir
You 've acquired a taste for this
Good morning sir
Good morning Treves
I hope we can talk together again sometime Good day
I am very pleased to meet you
It was a great pleasure to meet you Mr Merrick
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies Thou anointest my head with oil
What is it Treves
Yes of course Well it 's been a pleasure meeting you Mr Merrick Good day
everyone has been very kind
Of course How long did you and Mr Treves prepare for this interview
I everyone has been very kind to me
Everyone has been very kind I am extremely grateful
Are you comfortable here
I feel much better Thank you
I 'm feeling very fit thank you How is your bronchitis
I feel much better Thank you for asking And you
How are you feeling today
He 's imbecile no doubt from birth He speaks but it 's all gibberish No the man 's a homeless idiot I pray God he 's an idiot
You never mentioned his mental state
Nothing of any importance eh
I do n't know what I 've got
Certainly if you insist You must have quite a find there
You 'll know presently At the meeting of the society But until then I beg of you Fox keep it to yourself
Good Lord Freddie What have you got in there
Oh nothing nothing of any great importance
I say Freddie what are you about
What a mess
Abominable things these machines One ca n't reason with them
Mmmm Hodges Pierce come closer Mr Hill take hold of the rope please It 's a machine accident I expect you 'll be seeing a good deal of this
Three quarters of an hour
How long has this man been here
HEN I know no way to mince it in love but directly to say I love you What A speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl 'd pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
HEN What say you fair one That the tongues of men are full of deceits
O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies
HEN An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
Pardonnez-moi I can not tell vat is like me
HEN O fair Katharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate
Your majesty shall mock at me I can not speak your England
HEN Fair Katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady 's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart
Oh no no you 're a Romeo
Oh no
Why Mr Merrick you 're not an Elephant Man at all
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
No but I certainly shall
Have you read it
That 's one thing the theatre has in great store which reminds me I have something else for you
Romance
It 's very difficult to put into a nutshell but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world to any time you desire You may look over the shoulders of kings unobserved battle with ruthless tyrants and marry the beautiful princess all in the space of a few hours Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be do anything you please and always always live happily ever after The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world Mr Merrick It is lights and music gaiety and joy It 's well it 's romance
Tell me about it please
Well you must go It is one of the most beautiful places on earth Of course I 'm rather partial
Alas no
You 've never been
Well even to work there would be wonderful Is it beautiful
Oh no Mr Merrick I just work there
Mr Treves says that you are in the theatre Do you live there
Yes
She 's very pretty your mother
Oh no I would never think it It 's so beautiful You are so I 'll give it a place of honor here next to my mother
I want you to know that I do n't go about giving my pictures to just anyone
I knew you 'd understand Here
Oh no
I 've brought you some things I hope you 'll like Mr Merrick I hope you do n't think it too forward
Good day
Yes
Well it 's all quite I 've never heard It 's quite
Yes There is nothing more frustrating nothing that makes a physician feel more useless than standing by watching his patient deteriorate And when that patient is a friend no no there 's absolutely nothing I can do
Is he dying then
And yet not once have any of us heard him complain
How awful for John
I fear not Mrs Kendal Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly as is his pain
Well it is a miracle he ever got back And I 'm sure Mr Treves under your expert care he 'll have many happy years ahead
I 'm very grateful to you Mrs Kendal This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal John will be very excited
It 's all arranged I 'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr Merrick You 'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box
Good day Mr Merrick
John I 'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage Mrs Kendal Mrs Kendal John Merrick
DWARF You know I saw you once there in London You 're a great attraction

The main spire

It 's alright it was thrown away No one wants it It 's just that it 's a little dirty that 's all
I meant no harm it was the only place where I could find cardboard I thought it has been thrown away
The hallway Oh the wastecan

But it 's so good I mean it 's so very good

You want a dressing bag John
Please John it would give me so much pleasure to give you something Something just for yourself Is n't there something you would like to have
Oh no There is nothing I have everything you have given me everything I could possibly want I am happy every hour of the day I only wish there was something I could give to you
How blind of me Is there anything else John anything at all that I could get for you
Yes soon I will start the main spire but I must finish these columns first How kind of her
The cathedral is coming along nicely
I thought as much
No John I ca n't I can care for you but I ca n't cure you
Can you cure me
Yes John
Mr Treves there is something I 've been meaning to ask you for some time
Never oh Never nothing will die the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting When will the heart be aweary of beating and nature die

I never thought to ask How can you ever forgive me
You did not ask me
Why did you let me go on like that teaching you what you already knew Why did n't you tell me you could read

That 's much better I could understand that yes
Yyess
Yyyess
Yyes
Yes John
Yyyy Yyye yyyess
Welcome home John
So you see John there 's no need for a lighthouse All your friends are here
John thinks it 's very dashing Something no gentleman should be without I 'm inclined to agree
Well
You do n't think it 's too gaudy do you
A dressing bag
Yes John wants it
Very smart indeed
A dressing bag
Yes sir What 's that
Thank you Mothershead Have a porter put them in my office
Mr Treves some more books arrived for Mr Merrick
You 're right Mothershead please forgive me Of course I appreciate everything you 've done for John and I 'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare But I 'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best I 'm also very late so please forgive me
I bathed him did n't I I fed him and cleaned up after him If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern then yes I did treat him with loving kindness and I 'm not ashamed to say it
Are n't you being just a little harsh Mothershead You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived
But you saw them sir They could n't hide their disgust They do n't care anything for John they 're just trying to impress their friends
Now Mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for John He relishes contact with people outside the hospital
I ca n't understand why you let those people go in there sir
Oh Well quickly please Mothershead I 'm overdue
Excuse me sir I 'd like to have a word with you
Incredible is n't it Well I think John has had enough visitors for one day Mothershead I 've got a lecture at the college I 'll be back this evening
I regret that I must leave you here m Lord m Lady Thank you so much for coming It was an act of the greatest charity
Watery headed bunch
I 'm sure that if Mr Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they 'd see that he 's the exception to their rule Now I 'm not expecting miracles I 'm not saying he 'll be able to read or write but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself I 'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now That was very good John very good That 's all for today We shall do some more tomorrow Mothershead
Parrots can do as much Mr Treves It 's all very nice but I do n't see the point You know they wo n't let him stay here
We 've made tremendous strides today Mothershead He listens and repeats with great attention and this certainly is n't easy for him
Good Lord Mr Treves
Perhaps you 've got the time for that Mr Treves I certainly do n't I 've got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients Do n't waste your time with him sir it 's like talking to a wall I do n't mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him I 'll be back later for his bath And Mr Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment Good day sir
He 's had his share of smacks Mothershead I expect that 's what drives him under the bed We must use patience and understanding with this man
Just being obstinate sir I 'll handle it
No he 's very upset about something
Wo n't come out eh
Not quite yet Mrs Mothershead There seems to be some difficulty this morning
Good morning Mr Treves It 'll be his bath-time soon Has he eaten
Yes The workhouse
The workhouse
Yes Yes let 's go in
Sir you do n't have to worry about me I 'm not the sort to cry out Shall we go in
Yes Well I want you to clear up a little mess a breakfast tray was spilt And bring up another breakfast When you 've done that you and I shall give the man a bath But Mothershead I 'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this Above all do not scream do not cry out or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him
I 've heard
Good Excellent Now then Mrs Mothershead I want you to come into this room with me Inside there is a man with a rather unfortunate appearance
Fine
Ah Mothershead How are you feeling today
YOU 'RE THE MONSTER YOU 'RE THE FREAK GET OUT YOU 'RE FINISHED
PORTER YOU 'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME I ai n't done nothing wrong People pay to see your monster Mr Treves I just take the money
YOU BASTARD You tortured him YOU TORTURED HIM you bastard WHERE is HE
PORTER When I left him he was in his bed safe and sound
HE 'S GONE
PORTER Take him Now wait I did n't take him anywhere We were just having some fun We did n't hurt him just having a laugh that 's all
Do n't lie to me I know all about it You were SEEN Where did you take him
PORTER I I do n't know what you mean Sir
WHERE IS MR MERRICK
I 'll send a cab Here is my card
Bytes Mr Bytes He 'll be there
So you 'll bring him to me tomorrow 10:00 a.m Mr
Never mind I 'm the owner
Pardon me
Handsomely Who sent you
I 'd pay handsomely for a private showing Are you the proprietor
I do n't think so No sir we 're closed
Just one of the curious I 'd like to see it
And who might you be sir
Are you the proprietor
ARNULF Well my dear I think you 'll find it 's all a question of what you want to believe in I have slightly more experience of these matters than you
It 's sinking Hy-Brasil is sinking
But Father it IS
ARNULF It 's all right It is n't happening
ARNULF But one day I 'll catch you Like I caught her
It 's your fantasy
ARNULF She did I tell you She could blind me as easily as the night the day
There is no magic Father My mother had no magic
ARNULF I do n't know how you do it Aud I sometimes think you 've got some of your mother 's magic
It 's all in your own mind Father It 's YOU who imagine that I 'm always up here with some man or other
You 're losing your temper
ARNULF Ah So you admit there IS someone
There 's nobody here Father Look for yourself
ARNULF Well where is he
There IS no one
ARNULF Who Who Whoever you 've got in here of course
Who Father
ARNULF Right Where is he
ARNULF Open up I know you 're in there
Ah It 's my father
ARNULF Open up I know you 're in there
But Aud I I came to find someone
I do n't want to live WITHOUT you
No no
Then I shall come too
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard The Gods will never let you return
There is something I must ask the Gods
Blow the third note The note to take us home
Not quite
Erik You 've done what you came to do
The second note to wake the Gods
The second note
Then let go
Yes I believe you do
You do n't have to love me Just do you believe I love YOU
I but I
Do you believe I love you
Of course
YOU still want to go to Asgaard
I MUST look Keitel Hold this
No Do n't look The abyss will suck away your strength
That 's right
No No We are in the spell of the Horn Hatred will destroy us
No WAIT ERIK The Cloak The Cloak Invisible It only seems to work on my father
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible
Goodbye Aud
But you do n't realize
No It 's YOU who does n't understand Aud Halfdan has come to kill and destroy We brought him here We must stop him
Erik You do n't understand
I 'll bring it back
No
Why
Where 's the Cloak Invisible
I mean you could have killed yourself
Just give me a hand
But Erik
Halfdan the Black
Who
We must n't let him land
And the week before that
You 're as bad as my father
Five this week how many the week before
That 's just what I was trying to tell you You ARE
And I thought you said it was something special
Oh for goodness sake
The fifth one this week
The Cloak Invisible It was my mother 's parting gift
I 've never been to bed with anybody
I 've never LOVED anybody
You 've been to bed with somebody else have n't you
Why do you go on about that What does it matter
We never went to bed together
But you LOVED her all the same
Oh oh I did n't know her very well
What was she like
It was different
What does that matter But you 've you 've FELT like this before
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else
No I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you 'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams
You mean you HAVE got into bed with somebody else
No of course not silly I mean FELT like this about them
What you mean got into bed with them
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else
But surely you know
Yes
WHY
Put them down PLEASE make them put them down
What
PLEASE You do n't know what you 're doing
What 's the matter
These What are THESE They 're swords
Those things in your hands
What are what
Please Please What are those
Well EVERYONE is friends here on Hy Brasil
How d'you KNOW we 're friends
Well of course We always welcome friends
WELCOME
I said welcome
WHAT did you say
SHE blew the Horn Resounding
We blew the Horn Resounding
How do we know this is the way
What d'you mean
But How is it you can see me You can all see me
It was my master Keitel 's idea
But
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods so I disguised myself to sabotage their plans
LOKI Where did YOU come from
That I can not tell you
And will the dead ever return Freya
I will go and wake them up
The Gods are asleep Erik
Is there nothing men can do
The sky WAS blue Erik once
Of course not but when I was a child I remember a dream it was as if the whole sky was blue
But have you ever seen it Think back
The sun is up beyond the clouds where it always is
Have you ever seen the sun Erik
Is it summer or winter Erik
It is day of course Freya
Is it night or day Erik
I see the world
What do you see Erik
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman 's stories
I should n't have come
Now what CAN you want with me Erik the Viking
ARNULF The important thing is not to panic
But it IS Look
ARNULF Then I expect you 'll be leaving first thing in the morning
Yes oh yes
ARNULF Well it 's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing You DO know how to play the horn do n't you
Oh No No of course not it 's just I had n't expected it to be quite so big
ARNULF Is there something the matter with it
ARNULF I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years and will keep it for the next thousand
You do n't know Halfdan the Black
ARNULF Not when we explain about the Great Blessing
He wants to kill US
ARNULF Do n't talk nonsense
Because that 's how he makes his money by war and plunder
ARNULF Why
He 's trying to stop us waking the Gods
They 'll be more than hurt if Halfdan the Black lands Ow
ARNULF It 's all part of our safety regulations You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then well
You 've got to let me go
ARNULF Careful They 're not supposed to hurt you
Yes
ARNULF I 'll tell you what
ARNULF YOU try to be nice to people when they 're rude about your singing
The Gods are asleep King Arnulf
ARNULF Well how d'you think I feel
Your Majesty We come from a world where there IS no music Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword
ARNULF They did n't like it Oh God I want to die
No
ARNULF Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY totally genuinely honest with me Did you really truly honestly like it
No no It was very er nice
ARNULF We 're just not a very musical nation
ARNULF Right Summon the musicians We 'll do the one that goes TUM-TUM-TUM TUM-TI-TUM-TUM
No
ARNULF And you 're not just saying it because you think we want you to
Really
ARNULF REALLY
Of course we 're not we 'd genuinely like to hear you sing
ARNULF You 're just saying that
Er well we we would be TERRIBLY grateful if you all would sing for us
No no We 'd love to hear it Would n't we
ARNULF But you do n't want to hear it
I 'm sure it 's lovely
ARNULF A lot of people like our singing
Oh no no no It 's just the Horn Resounding is
ARNULF You do n't think our singing 's going to be good enough for you
Oh well yes of course it 's just we 're looking for the Horn Resounding and
ARNULF What 's the matter do n't you WANT to hear our singing
That 's very kind of you but we 're in rather a hurry We 're
ARNULF Would you like us to sing to you
ARNULF Well is n't it great
Well OBVIOUSLY there 's no killing
ARNULF Well for a start er there 's no killing
How
ARNULF The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves
No we do n't
I do n't know I just did
Why should you care
Odin
You 'll have to wait till he 's finished his game
Is THAT Odin
Well no
Have you tried to ask the God for anything
I 'll ask the Gods to give you life again
What 's the point of being dead in the land of the living
Why
What a stupid idea
I 've come to take you back to the land of the living
Tell me your name
Why should YOU care
Why should you care
I dunno you looked so so vulnerable
You told them I raped you why
Oh that 's all right then it 's the thought that counts
I did n't mean to
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death
Oh thanks
Aaagh Rape
Louder
Ah
Scream
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on
I just said I did n't feel like raping you
Well you started it
Oh Stop talking as if we were married
But that 's a circular argument If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out
To pay for the next expedition of course
Why Why have you got to go round killing and looting
Oh well you 've GOT to do them
What about the killing and looting That 's just as crude is n't it
Well it just seems a little bit crude that 's all
You DO N'T like it do you
About NOT raping you
About raping me
I 'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone
What d'you expect You come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me
I do n't suppose you you DO like me at all
What
I do n't suppose no
Oh get it over with
No It is n't rape then is it
What rape
No right this is RAPE Mark you I 'm not saying I could n't get to like you in fact well to be quite honest I prefer it when there 's some sort of mutual feeling between two people
You do n't love ME
Of course I like women I LOVE 'em
Sh
It 's obvious you have n't raped anyone in your life
Shut up
What about the raping
Yes
Looting and pillaging eh
Me Of course I 've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast
Have you done this sort of thing before
Do n't you FEEL it
It 's not magic It 's just a trick
I know I know
But You 're not even afraid of DEATH Thorfinn
He wants to KILL us
I know
Halfdan the Black 's here
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed
That 's terrible
You do n't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make friends
What 's wrong with making friends
No
Let 's hack her to pieces
Very deep usually
How deep IS the ocean
It saved my father
Erik Row What are you doing
I know Snorri Get your oar out
It 's Halfdan the Black
Come on move it
What are you talking about
He was lucky Sit there
Nothing Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night

Find it AND cross it

So What 'd you do to her
She got me thinking
It 's always the women that start the trouble
I met this girl
Who have you been talking to
Where does it all get us Grandpa
You talking piffle son
We toil and labor we loot and pillage rape and kill and yet

'S DAD Ohh I wanted to sit next to Leif
'S DAD You may need a real Berserk
What are YOU doing here
Look Erik
But you 're the Gods
Erik the Viking The things you seek are not in our power We do n't make men love each other or hate each other
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed
So
Because you 're you 're the Gods
Why should WE care
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun men fight and kill each other the whole time
We do n't HAVE to help anybody
You must help us
No Arrgh
You 'll be sucked down too
I 've got you
No Let go Snorri
Oh I feel a little oh
Were n't we supposed to
To the oars
A magic dishcloth
Like fish
Listen Maybe we wo n't get to Hy Brasil Maybe we wo n't find the Horn Resounding but at least we 've tried and at least we shall have died like men
Well come on
First we 're flying now we 're sinking
Has anyone told him we 've got a dragon eating our boat
Row
Now you 've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other
That 's better
Now you 've got all the big ones on one side
That 's true You 'd better sit there You there and Ornulf there
You ca n't have Sven 's father sitting next to Sven They 'll argue the whole time
Trust me to get the missionary
Leif you sit there Even you sit there Harald you 'd better sit over there
It 's SO nice to feel wanted
Now stop it
Thank you VERY much indeed
No We 'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods
You mean we 'd be dead
No do n't say anything else
Right Farewell for the last time may the gods prevent
I think we should go
Oh right Well CHEERS everybody
Just say something cheerful
What 's the matter with them
Oh er yes
You need to say a bit more than that
Nobody gets killed
Who gets killed
There is another way
What are you talking about
Do n't you see Erik She wants revenge
What is it
So Halfdan the Black 's using magic is he Well I have a magic to match his
How about making friends
Well what else do we do
But
And you Keitel Blacksmith
But how could he know unless
What do you think
What 's the matter with Bjorn
Bjorn 's not He could have Bjorn 's place
Keitel Blacksmith
Wait Erik
I have to go
I came to find my grandfather
Let me do something for myself for a change
Sven
Over the Edge of the World
We must blow the first note he note that will take us to Asgaard

Hy-Brasil
She MUST have a knife or something
She has n't got any
DEATH
ROW
We have n't got a spare place
I AM one Dad
I do n't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time
Well what difference does it make where you 're SITTING
Yes it does We could be at sea for months
It does n't matter WHERE you sit
Look I bagged it last week
I was sitting there
Hey you two What 's going on
I do n't know but I 'm not afraid to try
But HOW
We 'd be the first
Nobody 's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard
What 's the matter Are you afraid to try
Only the dead reach Asgaard Erik
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge
What are you talking about Erik
I will join my grandfather there
And you Sven are n't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard
Please
That 's why they call me Leif the Lucky
What d'you expect me to do
You will wait
Yeah well
Bye sorry
Bye Leif
Well where is he then
'S DAD He has n't
Vanish into thin air
'S DAD Do what
How did he do that
Nothing I just immerse you in water
'S DAD What do we have to do
It ca n't do you any HARM
'S DAD The Dragon
What 's all the panic about
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord
Quite MY lord said The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick
Your lord
You know my son our lord said
No it is NOT
Same thing is n't it
Thorbjorn Vifilsson 's wife became a Buddhist not a Christian
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson 's wife You converted HER
Listen I 've been in this dump for sixteen years and I have n't made a single convert
You 're wasting your time
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way
You coming You do n't even believe in Asgaard
Mum Dad
Oh Who cares We 're HOME
Oh yes I had n't noticed that
That 's it AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory
And a sort of slightly sick feeling
That 's it
Is it sort of like a sinking feeling in your stomach
Bastard
He used to puke in his sleep
Look I do n't feel BAD about it I just feel ILL
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage the whole time non-stop puke puke puke
I know I know
I mean many of the greatest sailors were
How can you help feeling bad when you 're sea-sick
You do n't need to feel bad about being sea-sick you know
No I 'm not
Are you all right
Hang on
For your own sake For the others I
I 've got you Keitel Blacksmith If you go I go too
I 'm not worth risking your life for
What are you talking about
Let me go Sven
Got you
Aaagh
What have you got there
Get away Snorri
What are you doing Keitel Blacksmith
What
Oh
It 's me I 'm just going to water the dragon
Who 's that
I I
Well Come on
It 's not my business any more
By YOU Keitel Blacksmith Do n't you know Erik that is why he went with you Ragnarok was good for his business
Made by YOU Loki
Like you got rid of Snorri
I should have got rid of you long ago
You fool
We came to stop you waking the Gods Erik But I did n't want anyone to get hurt
You 've lost your mind
No It 's YOU Loki I should never have listened to you
Keep your mouth shut Keitel
She knows it was our fault
Shut up
Help
Help
You 'll drown us bo
Help
Urrgh Argh Let go you idiot
I 'm drowning Help
Relax
I ca n't swim I ca n't swim
You 'll be able to throw it further than I could
YOU do it
Sh Hurry
How can we stops him now
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods
Well I I thought
Was n't it Keitel
You ca n't let Erik do THAT
Together we stand
Honour and protect all blacksmiths
The Blacksmith 's Code says I must
That 's right
My brother blacksmiths
It 's not just YOUR livelihood that 's at stake but your son 's and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths
The bottom falls out of the sword business
The Age of Ragnarok ends
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky
But Keitel if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding if he ever crosses Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge if he ever wakens the gods
Ca n't make enough axe-heads
Ca n't make enough swords
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok Keitel Blacksmith it is GOOD to us
Yes yes of course the Blacksmith 's Code
Oh I could n't do that The Blacksmith 's Code says
You just ca n't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand You could charge Halfdan twenty and he 'd pay it
You could charge him what you like
Yes it is good But I told him ten
Ooh that 's a good one You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one
'S DAD I hate you I hate you
Dad
'S DAD And his you 'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper
Easy Dad
'S DAD He drove me mad
'S DAD Helpless
There is nothing we can do
GIVE US A CHANCE Dad
'S DAD Well go on Go berserk

KILL KILL
'S DAD It 's no good going berserk against a dragon
I must KILL Kill
'S DAD Not now Sven
We 're being attacked KILL Kill Kill
I KNOW I 'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES
'S DAD You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle
I must only let the red rage
'S DAD But it 's a responsibility being a Berserk
But it 's a responsibility
'S DAD So did my father and his father before him
So did your father
'S DAD I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald
You went berserk
'S DAD I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair
I know Dad
'S DAD It 's a tradition
Tell him I 'm coming

Thorfinn You ca n't die
Erik 's right We 'll all meet in Valhalla
Shut up

They ca n't erase memories It 's a joke It 's a nasty Clementine hoax
You were n't supposed to see that
I do n't know I 'm so I ca n't believe she 'd be so goddamn immature
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on Just make a clean break
She 's punishing me for being honest I should just go to her house
I do n't know honey It 's horrible
Hi Joel So no jokes about my name
No it was lovely
You did You liked me
And I just liked you so much
But I do n't know maybe we 're the normal ones y'know I mean what kind of people do well at this stuff
But I thought I do n't know I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it
Anyhoo sweetie I done a bad thing I kinda sorta wrecked your car
Shit The last time I saw you
Here we are
Okay I guess
How are you today
Hi
Ms Kruczynski
Yes please have a seat He 'll be right with you
Yeah hi I have a one o'clock with Dr Mierzwiak Clementine Kruczynski
May I help you
Nothing is wrong with you You 're the most wonderful person I 've ever met
What 's wrong with me
It 's gorgeous Just my taste I 've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked Thanks So let 's get going Long drive
I did n't have a chance to wrap it
I 'm excited too Oh and I wanted to give you this It 's a little thing
I 'm so excited Yay
Yay It 'll be great I 'll get my shit
Um okay I 'll call my study partner
Now Now I have to go now I have to see the frozen Charles Now Tonight
Sure We 'll go next weekend and
Come up to Boston with me
Nothing makes any sense Nothing makes any sense
Oh Tangerine
I do n't know I 'm lost I 'm scared I feel like I 'm disappearing I 'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me
Oh baby what 's going on
In the world
In the room
It 's so cool You 're by far the most sensational person in the room
I really want to but tonight 's important Test tomorrow
You rat
I ca n't I want to but I have to study
Come over after I 'm done here
I was not
You were not
I just thought I 'd say hi I was in the neighborhood
I think I know I think we can help Why do n't you start by telling me about your relationship Everything you can think of Everything about him Everything about you And we 'll take it from there
Maybe gay is n't the right word But anyway it 's been rough with him whatever the fuck he is Heheh My significant other heh heh And I guess on a certain level I want to break it off but I feel y'know it 's like this constant questioning and re questioning Do I end it Should I give it more time I 'm not happy but what do I expect Relationships require work You know the drill The thing that I keep coming back to is I 'm not getting any younger I want to have a baby at some point maybe right So then I think I should settle which is not necessarily the best word I mean he 's a good guy It 's not really settling Then I think maybe I 'm just a victim of movies y'know That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be But then I think no this is what I really want so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it You know Agreed But then I think he is a good guy and It 's complicated Y'know
What No I do n't like the term boyfriend It 's so gay
You guess he 's your boyfriend Or you guess you 're having a bad time with him
Well I 've been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend I guess
Well why do n't you tell me what 's going on Do you mind if I turn this on
Okay I guess
How are you today
I just wanted to say that Come by my house
What old mill Is that somewhere we
Yay Meet me after work by the old mill
I ca n't stop thinking about you
You 're still excited by my irreverence You have n't yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock
We should have sex It 's old hat for us
I sort of do But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality Cleaned up enough to be erotic
Says you were constantly calling me a slob It 's sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overly-familiar and bored Do n't you think
Says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
Does n't sound like me
I do n't know
Did I use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
Says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
Well sounds like me Sorry man Says you were jealous and suspicious
That 's what it says You drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
A bully Moi
Says you were a bully
Says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling
I 'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you
Well you obviously do n't know me
Yeah I would n't have thought that
I 'm nervous too
and I 'm just too nervous around you right now
Hey Joel
I 'm sorry I just wanted to say that This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
That 's okay I
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
Oh um
Have sex Y'know
Make love
Listen did you want to make love
Joel come here Please
I think I should go back
What if
I do n't know What if it breaks
I do n't know
Do n't worry It 's really solid this time of year
Yeah
Tonight Just to test out the phone lines
Tomorrow
When
Yeah
So you 'll call me right
I love you
Bye Joel
Come back and make up a good-bye at least Let 's pretend we had one
I walked out the door There 's no more memory
What if you stay this time
I did I walked out the door I felt like I was a scared little kid I thought you knew that about me I ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation You said so go with such disdain
So go
No it 's our house Just tonight we 're David and Ruth Laskin Which one do you want to be I prefer to be Ruth but I 'm flexible Alcohol You make drinks I 'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth I 'm ruthless at the moment
I think we should go
Ah-ha Now I can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet
Naomi
Yeah What 's your girlfriend 's name
It 's dark
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi was n't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
I knew
I could see you wanted to come in Joel
I hesitated for what seemed like forever
C'mon man The water 's fine Nobody 's coming here tonight believe me This place is closed up Electricity 's off
It 's freezing out here
What are you doing
Cool
At least I have n't been barking up the wrong tree
Female
Male or female
Oh
I do sort of live with somebody though
Let 's move into this neighborhood
Um no
I wish we did You married
Yes I love that poem It breaks my heart I 'm so excited you know it Look houses in which we do n't live
Yeah yeah It goes Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines
Do you know her poem that starts Seaside gusts of wind And a house in which we do n't live
Yeah maybe
Seems too coincidental that way
I think before
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
Me too There 's this poem
I think she 's great
Really Me too I do n't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store
I love her
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova
Okay
I 'll give you a couple See what you think
yeah
You should try Xanax I mean it 's a chemical and all but it works and it works just having it around knowing that it 's there Like insurance
I do n't think I 've slept in a year
But my sleeping is really fucked up
I know what you mean That 's why I stopped
No I stopped I did n't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated
Enjoy it Say good-bye
What do we do
I know
This is it Joel It 's gon na be gone soon
Nope No jokes My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll I think your name is magic
Yeah like that
You mean like Oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin Clementine Huckleberry Hound That sort of thing
I 'm Joel
Oh God how horrid
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
I 'm Clementine Can I borrow a piece of your chicken
You said
Yeah I know I 'm fishing
You know what I did
Even then I did n't believe you entirely I thought how could you be talking to me if you could n't talk to people
I ca n't tell you how happy I am to hear that I mean I do n't mean I 'm happy you 're uncomfortable but yknow I 'm such a loser Every time I come to a party I tell myself I 'm going to be different and it 's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod
Yeah I do n't ever know what to say
I saw you sitting over here By yourself I thought thank God someone normal who does n't know how interact at these things either
You said
Hi
Hi there
Remember me Try your best Maybe we can
It would be different if we could just give it another go around
I know
I still thought you were going to save me Even after that
Probably
You had the whole human race pegged
I had you pegged did n't I
I remember that speech really well
Joel I 'm not a concept I want you to just keep that in your head Too many guys think I 'm a concept or I complete them or I 'm going to make them alive but I 'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind Do n't assign me yours
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we 'll talk again
Okay
Look man I 'm telling you right off the bat I 'm high maintenance So I 'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there If you want to be with me you 're with me
Not yet Not married
Well you 're married
I 'd like to take you out or something
Yeah
Sorry to track you down like this I 'm not a stalker But I needed to see you
I did n't think you 'd show your face around me again I figured you were humiliated You did run away after all
I did it I guess that means something
Is that what you want
I told her today I need to end it
Yes exactly Exactly my point
It 's very late
Come up and see me now
I dropped you off after You said
And I did n't have an argument
So what Infatuation is good too
I thought I was foolish I thought I 'd mistaken infatuation for love You said
I was so nervous I remember I could n't think of anything to say There were long silences
But you were n't I could tell
I 'm sure I said
I said Are you sure You seem unsure
We did talk about Naomi
I 'll buy that Black 's always good
Right Something black though
No I think you were wearing that black dress y'know with the buttons
Egad were you horrified
God I should know Your hair was red I remember it matched the wallpaper
What was I wearing
Yeah
Naomi I guess
Do you remember what we talked about
This is our first date date
I want to enjoy my little time left with you
Yeah
I 'm done Clem I 'm just going to ride it out Hiding is clearly not working
I love it
I scoured the city for it
Thanks Joely A present Oh boy
Happy Birthday
I do n't like it either but I 'm just trying to find horrible secret place to
Joel
This kid Joe Early is going to beat the shit out of me
Look at you cutey What are we doing
Hide me somewhere deeper Somewhere buried
They found us before The plan did n't work I do n't know what to do now
Yes but I ca n't love a man named Wally
Do n't call me Antoine My name is Wally
But ca n't you see I love you Antoine
Gross You must remember to tell me this in the morning I 'm like so freaked out now
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased
Really Is he cute
There 's this guy I heard him talking in my apartment He 's one of the eraser guys And he fell for you when they were erasing you so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you 're dating him
What
There 's this guy
another rainy day Whatever shall we do
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good like you just woke up slightly sweaty And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like
You remember what happened next
I loved you so much this day On my bed in your panties I remember I thought how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties
You know we 're okay They 're not finding us You 'll remember me in the morning And you 'll come to me and tell me about us and we 'll start over
Joel Joely look it 's not fading The memory I think we 're hidden
I 'm scared I want my mommy I do n't want to lose you I do n't want to lose
I 'm right here
I want my mommy I do n't want to lose you Clem
Well if they 're looking for me in memories I 'm in what if you take me to a memory I 'm not in And we can hide there till morning
What do you mean
What if you hide me
I do n't know
Wow Um well ca n't you just force yourself awake
I hired them to We 're in my brain But I want it to stop before I wake up and do n't know you anymore
Oh
Yes indeed Fuck They 're erasing you Clem
Such a beautiful view
It 's my favorite book Since I was a kid It 's about these toys There 's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real I ca n't believe I 'm crying already He says It takes a long time That 's why it does n't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept Generally by the time you are Real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby But these things do n't matter at all because once you are Real you ca n't be ugly except to people who do n't understand
No
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit
Yeah Tangerine
Joely
No Thanks
More
Joel you 're a liar
I just do n't have anything very interesting about my life
I want to know you
No it is n't that
You do n't tell me things Joel I 'm an open book I tell you everything Every damn embarrassing thing You do n't trust me
You 're a whiz kid So perceptive so
You 're drunk
Would you get me another Joely
So um
It 's you It 's you who ca n't commit to anything You have no idea how lucky you are I 'm interested in you I do n't even know why I am I should just end it right here Joel Leave you in the zoo Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with
Oh thank God It 's going
I 'd make a fucking good mother I love children I 'm creative and smart and I 'd make a fucking good mother
Clem I 'm sorry I should n't have
You ca n't fucking say something like that and say you do n't want to talk about it
Joel We 're fucking gon na talk about it
I do n't want to talk about this here
What
Clementine do you really think you could take care of a kid
You 're not ready
I do n't think we 're ready
No I want to have a baby I have to have a baby
Let 's talk about it later
I want to have a baby
Oh shit I remember this Want to go
I 'm fucking crawling out of my skin
Where are you going
How can you watch this crap
Look at it out here It 's falling apart I 'm erasing you And I 'm happy
Fuck you Joel Faggot
Let me drive you home
No see Clem I assume you fucked someone tonight Is n't that how you get people to like you
A wino Jesus Are you from the fifties A wino Face it Joel You 're freaked out because I was out late without you and in your little wormy brain you 're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight
Oh Christ I did n't kill anybody It 's just a fucking dent You 're like some old lady or something
I do n't know maybe you did kill somebody
Well it is pathetic And fucking irresponsible You could 've killed somebody
a little I was a little tipsy Do n't call me pathetic
I ca n't believe you wrecked my car You 're driving drunk It 's pathetic
It 's three
Yo ho ho
You did n't say anything about my hair
How could she have done this to me How could anyone do this to anyone
Okay
Tonight Just to test out the phone lines and all
Tomorrow
When
Yeah
You 'll call me right
So I enjoyed meeting you
Yes
I would like you to call me Would you do that I would like that
Okay
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so
You should stay
Sounds good But right now I should go
I 'll pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and
Yeah Oh great
Okay
I do n't believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things We like the same writers This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to And he 's cute It 's fucked up Joel you should come up to the Charles with me sometime
I think so
Exactly I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but I was really disappointment to be there with him Y'know And that 's where psychic stuff comes in Like it just is n't right with him Y'know
That 's scary sounding
That made me cry But anyway we went up to Boston because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River It gets frozen this time of year
Oh yeah
Well for the last week anyway He 's kind of a kid Kind of a goofball but he 's really stuck on me which is flattering Who would n't like that And he 's like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart He 's the one who gave me that crow photograph
I do n't either I used to But I 'm through with that Y'know if I do n't love my body then I 'm just lost You know With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that 's coming 'round the bend So I 've been seeing this guy
No not at all
I 'm nervous You do n't need to be nervous around me though I like you Do you think I 'm repulsively fat
No
You 're very nice God I have to stop saying that You 're nervous around me huh
Yeah
Like I wanted to talk to you I did n't need any more reason to do it Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist
Yeah I think so It 's hard to
What 's the goal Joel My goal Joel is to just let it flow through me Do you know what I mean It 's like there 's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we 're all taught we should be consistent Y'know You love someone that 's it Forever You choose to do something with your life that 's it that 's what you do It 's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through And my feeling is that 's how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing You know
Yeah
And anyway you sell yourself short I can tell There 's a lot of stuff going on in your brain I can tell My goal can I tell you my goal
Thanks
I like you That 's the thing about my psychic thing I think that 's my greatest psychic power that I get a sense about people My problem is I never trust it But I get it And with you I get that you 're a really good guy
I do have a tendency to use that word too much
You 're really nice I 'm sorry I yelled at you before about it God I 'm an idiot
I think about that
Oh Does that make you sad Or anxious I 'm always anxious thinking I 'm not living my life to the fullest y'know Taking advantage of every possibility Just making sure that I 'm not wasting one second of the little time I have
Sorry My life is n't that interesting I go to work I go home I do n't know what to say
It 's helpful to think there 's some order to things You 're kind of closed mouthed are n't you
But I think I am I like to think I am
Yeah I guess
Exactly Exactly That 's exactly my feeling about it It 's hard to know Like okay but how many times do I think something and it does n't happen That 's what you 're saying right You forget about those times Right
Yeah I do n't know It 's hard to know
Me neither But sometimes I have premonitions so I do n't know Maybe that 's just coincidence Right Y'know you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it Y'know
I do n't know
Well I go to a psychic and she 's always telling me I 'm psychic She should know Do you believe in that stuff
Yeah
Y'know I 'm sort of psychic
Drink up young man It 'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant
Thanks
I know a man who needs a refill
No I
No stay Just for a little while Refill
Well I should probably get going
I do n't know I ca n't see them from here Joel Just pick something good
You just say I 'm not really
You pick it
What do you want to hear
No I 'm okay for now
Ready for another
Yeah Well have a seat anyway
I 'm fine
God that feels so fucking good Take yours off
Cheers
I miss grade school I do n't know why I 'm calling it grade school all of a sudden When I went we called it elementary school But I like grade school better Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it I 'd like to be from then Everyone wore hats Anyway cheers
It 's pretty
Yeah I 'm not like a Robert Frost lover by any stretch His stuff seems strictly grade school to me But this made me cry for some reason Maybe because it is grade school Y'know
Frost
Me neither Oh there 's an inscription on the back The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued
I do n't know
Do you believe in that stuff Reincarnation
Thanks That was good that crow sound
This someone gave that to me just like recently I like it too I like crows I think I used to be a crow
Very much
You like that
Never mind Sorry that was stupid I 'm embarrassed Good night Joel
Um
Hey do you want to have a drink I have lots of drinks And I could
Take care
Oh geez I 'm full of shit I already told you that Anyway See Ya
Well I would n't want to be
Thanks very much That was very nice of you
I 'm just a bit of a wreck I sleep in your hat makes me cry Me
What
Remember And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I 'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat Oh shit I 'm so stupid Sorry
Sort of um
The song 's 9th and Hennepin I spent most of the train ride trying to remember Till you 're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who 'll listen Remember
Yeah I ca n't remember that album very well I remember liking it But
Me too It is Rain Dogs by the way
I like to read
So you like bookstores huh
It 's okay I did n't think you were
Look I 'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso I 'm not really
Wilmont Near the high school
Yeah
You know Wilmont
I 'm not a stalker
You ca n't be too careful I 've been stalked I 've been told I 'm highly stalkable I do n't need that
Well I probably would n't say if I were but no
You 're not a stalker or anything right
Where do you live
Yeah
It 's okay
I do n't want to take you out of your way
You 're sure It 's cold
No that 's okay Thanks though
Hi I could give you a ride if you need
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job
Probably see you at the book store
Oh okay Well sure I 'll just Take care then
It 's no problem Anyway I have some stuff I need to
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you 're nice Right now anyway I ca n't tell from one moment to the next what I 'm going to like But right now I 'm glad you said that 's okay to me That was nice of you
That 's okay
I 'm sorry I yelled at you Was it yelling I ca n't really tell Whatever I 'm a little out of sorts today
Yes
Joel It 's Joel right
Shit Shit I know it 's here Hold on
Okay
I do n't need nice I do n't need myself to be it and I do n't need anyone else to be it at me
Well anyway Sorry
Now I 'm nice Do n't you know any other adjectives There 's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative mumpish
Oh I do n't know I was just I do n't know I was You seemed nice so
Why would n't you think that about me
See I would n't think that about you
Yeah Although it hardly fits I 'm a vindictive little bitch truth be told
Sorry It 's a pretty name though It means merciful right
Oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin Clementine No
I 'm not nuts
Huckleberry Hound What are you nuts
I do n't know what that means
Huckleberry Hound
I do n't know any jokes about your name
No jokes about my name Oh you would n't do that you 're trying to be nice
I 'm Joel
My name 's Clementine by the way
Yeah I got it
Sorry I was just trying to be nice
Well you do n't know me so you do n't know do you
Oh I doubt that 's the case
I think Anyway I 've tried all their colors More than once I 'm getting too old for this But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality I apply my personality in a paste You
You sure That does n't sound
My writing career Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs
I 'm sure you would
Someone 's got that job Agent Orange I came up with that one Anyway there are endless color possibilities and I 'd be great at it
You think that could possibly be a full time job How many hair colors could there be
Purple Haze Pink Eraser
I do n't really know how
Anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names Red Menace Yellow Fever Green Revolution That 'd be a job coming up with those names How do you get a job like that That 's what I 'll do Fuck the dole
I ca n't remember
Exactly Tom Waits Which song
Yeah Tom Waits says it in
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering
I like it
Ah the hair Blue right It 's called Blue Ruin The color Snappy name huh
I noticed your hair I guess it made an impression on me that 's why I was pretty sure I recognized you
I 'll go on the dole Like my daddy before me
I do n't have one
Well I 'm there I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible You have a cell phone I need to quit right this minute I 'll call in dead
because I go there all the time I do n't think I ever saw you before
Jesus is it five years I got ta quit right now
Really Because
Ucch really You 're kidding God Bizarre small world huh Yeah that 's me book slave there for like five years now
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you I thought that earlier in the diner That 's why I was looking at you You work at Borders right
Get out Me too What are the odds
Rockville Center
Just you know to chat a little maybe I have a long trip ahead of me How far are you going On the train I mean of course
It 's okay really
No I do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to
I mean it 's okay if you want to sit down here I did n't mean to
Oh So
No I mean I do n't know I ca n't really think of much to say probably
It 's okay if I sit closer So I do n't have to scream Not that I do n't need to scream sometimes believe me But I do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to write or something
Anyway Sorry Hi
Aw c'mon live dangerously Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car
Well I did n't want to assume
Really
No I did n't know if you were talking to me so
Why are you sorry I just said hi

Why
I 'm sorry

It 's true
That 's what you have to say How could it be true I never even heard of any procedure like this It 's a joke
'S VOICE Maybe it 's true then It 's my voice on the tape
I mean I have n't even told anyone I 've met you Who would even know to do this
'S VOICE I probably got the same thing as you
Did you send this Is it a joke
'S VOICE Yeah

'S VOICE That 's me
'S VOICE Long day thinking

'S VOICE Yeah I tried you at home Did you get my message
I know I had to take the day to think
'S VOICE Good I called you at work today They said you were home sick

'S VOICE Hi
Hi Naomi it 's Joel
I did n't want to go I was too nervous I thought maybe you were a nut But you were exciting You called from upstairs
I really should go I really need to catch my ride
I could n't believe you did that I was paralyzed with fear
Clementine
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf
So you 're still on the Zoloft
But I went back to my food The next thing I remember I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye
I remember being drawn to you even then I thought I love this woman because she 's alone down there looking out at the black ocean
Your back to me In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually At the time I thought how cool an orange sweatshirt
This is it The night we met My God it 's over
Okay I wish you could come
On the couch Dark Quiet I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times I thought I could take it back erase it explain I had momentarily lost my mind Then I told myself we were n't happy That was the truth That what we were was safe It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it was n't much fun But I wanted fun I saw other people having fun and I wanted it Then I thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun I 'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit then I thought maybe not maybe not And then I thought as I always do at this point in my argument about dying
Naomi
I did n't want to do this But I had to or they would 've called me a girl
I ca n't I have to go home I 'll do it later
I loved you on this day I love this memory The rain Us just hanging
She 's so sexy
Is that like us Are we just bored with each other
How 's the chicken
And what are you like A wino
Right She called me an old lady here too And I remember I said
Any messages Carmen
I was n't going to call her Not after the way she was
So then she just stops calling
Oh God I miss her I ca n't believe she 's with that guy now I 'm never going to see her again I love her so much What a fucking monster she is
Got ta get home How could she do this to me How could she not care about what we meant to each other What a fuck What a fucking monster she is
That 's your look for me
Clementine
Maybe if I just explain what happened I would n't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and
I love you and if you knew that if I told you what happened I 'll explain everything what we meant to each other I 'll tell you everything about our time together You 'll know everything again and
Clementine I should just maybe talk to her
I should maybe talk to you
It 's too late
It 's them
The pill was pink I remember It had some letters and numbers on it What were they AL 1718 AL something Four digits I do n't like taking pills when I do n't know what they are I have no choice
Pink There was a number on it I remember AL 1718 I have to follow through with this I have no choice
Fuck you Clementine
Maybe I 'm making a mistake Maybe I just need to learn to live with this First of all I 'll get over it Secondly it happened Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it Who said that Churchill I 'm not sure But I do n't care She did it to me I have to rid myself of this Fuck her
I might be making a mistake
I 'm like a joke to them
The driver waved So casual friendly
There are two of them Could n't make them out The orange glow of a cigarette
It was snowing
Yes but I 'm just something you 're imagining What can I do I 'm in your head too
I 'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased Stop it now
What What do you mean
You have to stop this
We can help you through this Why do n't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about
It was a mess I do n't know how it got this way
We can help you through this Why do n't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine
Well I did
I 'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards You never should have
Well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking Nothing you 'll miss
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage
We 'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards There is an emotional core to each of our memories As we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process By the time you wake up in the morning all memories we 've targeted will have withered and disappeared Like a dream upon waking
'Night
We 'll speak soon
So I 'm going to get some sleep I 'm glad you 're okay
I had a good time last night I really did
Okay Joel I suppose you 're right
I do n't know I 'm not sure there 's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny
So you think the dissertation will get published
I 'm glad you called
I 'm sorry I really should n't have
A religion instructor at Columbia A good guy He 's a good guy
Oh Great That 's great
Miss you too I have been seeing someone for a little while
I miss you
Oh sweetie It really does cut both ways We were taking each other for granted and
Well it was my fault the break up I 'm sorry
I 'm sorry
It 's been a pretty lonely couple of years
So you have n't been involved with anyone in all this time
Yeah
I hope you get your work done
Say hi to Rob and Carrie Have some fun
I 've got to finish this chapter anyway
So you do n't mind
In a minute
Yeah Come to bed I 'm cold
Go back to sleep
Hi Rob and Carrie
You did n't miss much Rob and Carrie say hello
How was it
Hi
Hi
It 's not somebody else
The thing is Joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off you 're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems
No I just need some space maybe
Bullshit Who is it You met someone
I think maybe we 're both so used to operating at this level that How can one person be unhappy If one person is unhappy both have to be by definition
Do n't say we when you mean you
Y'know we 've been I do n't know sort of unhappy with each other and
What
I do n't know I 've just been thinking maybe we 're not happy with each other
So what 's going on Joel
Do n't do this to me now Joel Really
Naomi I really value our relationship I hope it 's possible for us to stay in touch
You take it I do n't know
Yours
I think he 'll be in Bartlett 's one day
Definitely
I like to read what smart people say So many beautiful important things
Very cool Trippy
The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts
Yeah Cool
I love quotes So did Winston Churchill He actually has a quotation in Bartlett 's about Bartlett 's Is n't that trippy
Nah I do n't know
Oh Patrick you did n't want any did you
Hi Mary How 's it going
Oh hey Patrick
Mary please This is hurting people
Remember the Alamo Remember the Alamo
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased
I wo n't allow it Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it What do you think of that That 's from my quote book
Mary people come to him voluntarily
They have a right to know Howard is a thief He steals the truth I ca n't remember my baby I ca n't remember my baby It existed and I ca n't even remember Do you understand that
I do n't know I just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office
Then why did you ask me
I know what it is
Nothing
What 's this
Can I I brought some
What do you want Stan
Hi
Oh
Thanks Stan
You were in red That red sweater with the little flowers I think You were leaning against his car He looked a little like a kid Kind of goofy and wide-eyed I 'd never seen him look like that before Happy You looked beautiful You looked in love
Do you remember anything else What I was wearing Was I standing close to him Was I leaning against his car like I owned it How did he look at me when I giggled Tell me everything
I really like you Mary You know that
I never saw you together like that again So I figured I was imagining things
And after that
Happy Happy with a secret
How did I look
It was here At his car I was coming back from a job and spotted you together You seemed caught I waved You giggled
Once maybe
And you never even suspected Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together
I swear
Do you swear you did n't know
Hey
Hell no
You better go
He 's coming
This guy 's only half cooked There 's no time to fuck around Stan
No way I can handle this
Shit
Sor-ry We have to do something He ca n't wake up half done
I do n't know I just said that
Well what should we do
I do n't know what to do I do n't know what to do Crap Crap
I do n't know He 's not on the map
Where
It 's not erasing He 's off the screen
Listen it 's not erasing
What
It 's stopped
You love him do n't you
To let people begin again It 's beautiful You look at a baby and it 's so fresh so clean so free And adults they 're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness hopelessness And Howard just makes it go away
Yeah
It 's amazing is n't it Such a gift Howard gave the world
Go
Let him go Stan I can help
Yup
Do n't you think Howard 's like that Smart Important
Yup
It 's a good one all right
Yeah I ca n't wait to tell Howard It seems really appropriate
That 's a good one
Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil Found it my Bartletts

Hi
Boo
I did n't make you You thought it best But look I take full responsibility
You made me have you erased I loved you I love you How could you
It was a mutual decision
You made me have an abortion
I have a family Mary
Do you love me Did you love me Something I listened to my tape I ca n't believe I 've been sitting right in front of it for a year It 's like listening to someone else 's story I mean I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I ca n't even imagine you naked I ca n't even say naked to you
I do n't know what I 'm supposed say Mary I want to do the right thing here
Thanks So do we talk about this or what
We have a history I 'm sorry You wanted the procedure You wanted it done to get past I have to finish in there It 's almost morning We 'll talk later
What Howard
No you 're right Once again You 're a decent man Howard
We ca n't do this
I wish I was your wife I wish I had your kids
I 've got a wife Mary Kids You know that
I 've loved you for a very long time I 'm sorry I should n't have said that
Okay Good Great Thanks I like you Howard an awful lot Is that terrible
It 's fine Mary I 'm happy to hear it
Really I thought it was appropriate maybe That 's all I really admire the work that you do I know it 's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we 're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to
That 's lovely
You are such a sweetheart
It 's no big deal
Yes shit Oops sorry Sorry It 's just I told myself I was n't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it Like I psyched myself out
Alexander Pope
There 's another one I like I read It 's by Pope Alexander
It 's a good quote Mary I 'm glad we both know it
Yeah yeah it is Howard And here I was thinking I could tell you something you did n't know
Is that Nietzsche
Okay um there 's one that goes Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders
Oh Well I 'd love to hear some
Oh um like famous quotes I find reading them inspirational to me And in my reading I 've come across some I thought you might like too
How do you mean
Do you like quotes Howard
Well thank you Mary
That was beautiful to watch Howard Like a surgeon or a concert pianist
Okay we 're back in
Welcome Howard
Thanks
Cole slaw ice tea
Order me a pastrami for after
Yes
Mary
Thanks Mary You can bring her in
Howard your one o'clock
'S VOICE 1062 Sherman Drive Apartment 1E Rockville Center
Jesus All right what 's the address
'S VOICE He went home sick
Well where was Patrick
'S VOICE I was away from the monitor for a second I had it on automatic I had to go pee
Okay what happened right before he disappeared
'S VOICE The guy we 're doing He 's disappeared from the map I ca n't find him anywhere
Stan What 's going on
Jesus
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people
I do n't know what you 're talking about Howard
She should not have done this Stan As mad as she was as justifiably
Thanks Stan Thanks
So I 've got to drop the van off
That 's fine Stan
I 'll go out for a smoke If no one minds
Oh dear
Howard they 've disappeared again
Yeah probably a good idea
You get some sleep Howard I 'll take it from here
Yeah Of course
Did you try going through C-Gate
I tried that already
She came to help Howard
Mary What are you doing here
December 15th 2004 I met someone tonight Oh Christ I do n't know what to do Her name is Clementine and she 's amazing So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long
Ah your journal This will be invaluable
Maybe after the holidays then
WOMAN This book It 's essential that people read it because It 's the truth And only I know it
Of course Please have a seat
WOMAN Would you just try him You never know As long as I 'm here You never know
I think he 's in a conference Unfortunately I 'm really sorry
WOMAN Hi I was in the neighborhood and thought I 'd see
Oh hi
Thanks Stan I owe you
I can handle it He 's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway
She 's right in the neighborhood She 's upset
Patrick we 're in the middle of
Hold on Let me ask my friend Stan can I leave for a little while My girlfriend is very
It 's a quote book
What 's your bartlett 's
Okay There 's more Stan
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties
Mary hates me I 've never been popular with the ladies
Jesus Patrick
She was beautiful So sweet and funky and voluptuous I kind of stole a pair of her panties is what
She was unconscious Patrick
I got ta tell you something I kind of fell in love with her last night
Patrick we need to focus
The thing is my situation is a little weird My girlfriend situation
This one 's history Moving on
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend
You can if you want
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over too I have a girlfriend now
She likes you okay
I like Mary I like when she comes to visit I just do n't think she likes me
Just wanted to let you know
Yeah
Yeah
Patrick let 's just get through this We have a long night ahead of us
Not a dump then but kind of plain Uninspired And there 's a stale smell Sort of stuffy I do n't know Stuffy
It 's an apartment
Yeah that looks better Thanks
Does that help
Then check the connections
The voltage looks fine
That 's your problem
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I 'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics All in Siwash Cave In a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools It would have to rely on its wits and its senses It would have to live with animals and plants as virtual equals It 's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve
The world is n't going to end you dummy I hope you know that much But it is going to change It 's going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue But there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption It is n't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but there 'll be some of us it 'll miss Little pockets of humanity Like the Clock People Like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave There 's almost no worldwide calamity famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you could n't survive in that cave
Well if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard
Easy come easy go
But that 's an old story now I ca n't believe that you would leave the Butte
You mean she 's dead
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City
I want to go back to the Clock People I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they 're up to What 's happened to Jelly
The Countess has come to our aid The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls And I have been asked to oversee the ranch For 300 a week And as it turns out the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was here 's a picture
Yes everything is getting worse But everything is also getting better
Is everything getting worse
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
What do you believe in then
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese And the name stuck In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled Indians through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that Indians misnamed me The Clock People however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes They have lived together since 1906
Then if you are Japanese then why are you called the Chink
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp as a Japanese-American I had been put there and watched over I found refuge with the Clock People who discovered me in a snow bank near dead I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains
The Clock People
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe ha ha ho ho and hee hee
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own
Siwash huh
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People
Clockworks
Clockworks
What was that
Neither do I ha ha ho ho hee hee
But I do n't know how to polka
Save your breath for the climb
Oh Well there 's been some trouble on the ranch I came up here to get out of the way It 's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down If you could help
I know who you are
I 'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean 's
Oh Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home
Where are the others
You might say that although I do n't think of it as traveling
A traveler eh
Well no I do n't reside anywhere in particular I just keep moving
You do n't
I do n't
I know but where do you reside when you are n't visiting New York
I 'm staying with the Countess
Where do you live Miss Hankshaw
If I flinch when you say you love me it 's both our problems My confusion becomes your confusion Students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts
Every time I tell you that I love you you flinch But that 's your problem
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains It 's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years
'Drugged is a stupid word
No I guess not
How did this business get started anyhow Why are the birds nesting here
Hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but I 'm not in this for whooping cranes I 'm in it for cowgirls If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise I want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised
So be it It looks serious this time though All these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess
FROM MEN THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE 'S MARSHES STOLEN ITS EGGS INVADED ITS PRIVACY POLLUTED ITS FOOD FOULED ITS AIR BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT
That 's Jellybean
I would n't say that I expect she 's right ultimately But I 'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what 's mine I ca n't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink he could probably teach her a thing or two Ee That grass tickles does n't it God knows I love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits Still this is cowgirl territory and I 'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it I guess I 've always been a scrapper Look This scar Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet
You do n't agree with Debbie then
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they must n't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age She 's a real dreamer that Debbie-dear
What is Debbie 's position
Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her Third Vision has n't happened Niwetükame the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools Tension Cowgirl tension What a drag
Learned from the Chink Oh my Ha ha That 's hard to say We mostly Uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy
Really The Chink huh I 've gathered that you sometimes speak with him What else have you learned from the Chink
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth It 's not original It 's something I picked up from the Chink
No ma'am No way There 's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political but I do n't share their views I got no cowgirl ideology to expound Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
You 're political then
Cowgirls exist as an image A fairly common image The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture Therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail Otherwise they 're being fooled In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls Two And both of 'em are trick-riders Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks That 's what prostitutes call it you know 'tricking
About being a cowgirl What 's it all about When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
About
Tell me about it
Well that does n't matter that part never interested me anyway The beatnicks were before my time and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichés and the clap But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl
No I 'm afraid that part is n't true Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover Besides I always travel alone
Oh I know about Sissy Hankshaw all right I 've done a little hitchhiking myself Ah shucks that 's like telling Annie Oakley you 're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone I 'd heard tales about you from people I 'd meet in jail cells and truckstops I heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac 's girl friend
Er you seem to know who I am and maybe even what I am Thanks for the breakfast
Welcome podner By God it 's great to have you here It 's an honor Sorry I took so long getting to you but we 've had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do
COUNTESS Aw he 's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies too But though he be old and dirty he 's alive I 'll bet clear down to his toes They do n't have his juice in a jar in New Haven Well I suppose that I 'll have to write Sissy out on the road
What guy
COUNTESS Chink 's the guy 's name for Christ 's sake
If we Ivy Leaguers are n't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we do n't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink Next thing I know you 'll be calling me 'chief
COUNTESS What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools anyway Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck Why send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he 'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy Jesus H.M.S Christ If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they 'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps Oogie boogie
I suppose it was mine Yes it definitely was my fault
COUNTESS Whose fault was that
Oh we did n't get it all the way on
COUNTESS Shit O dear Julian Do you mean to tell me you did n't get it on
Well er
COUNTESS What do you think
COUNTESS Like what
How does she like what in bed
COUNTESS She always leaves town you dummy That does n't mean anything What about in bed How does she like it in bed
I think she 's disappointed that I 'm not more ah sort of atavistic She 's got some naive sentimental notions about Indians I 'm sure she liked me though but then she left town
COUNTESS Ninety degrees to the left I hope How does she feel about you
Countess I 'm really in a dither She 's turned my head
COUNTESS It 's high time you realized honey babe that a woman does n't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language
Oh you I 'm not talking about her hands They 're difficult to ignore I confess but I 'm speaking of her whole being Her whole being is extraordinary The way she talks for example She 's so articulate
COUNTESS She 's obviously that Jesus Which would you rather have a million dollars or one of Sissy 's thumbs full of pennies
Extraordinary
My thumbs hurt I 've made a mistake I 've been negligent I have n't exercised I have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what It 's like a musician practicing his scales When I do n't practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore
Why Why do you have to go
I have to go Julian
But I do n't want you to leave Please stay We can go to dinner I owe you a dinner And tonight we can really make love
Getting dressed I 've got to go
What are you doing
It 's not the air conditioner that 's making me cold Nothing moves in here Not even your birds
Here I 'll turn down the air conditioner
I 'm cold
As I developed however I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style Time in terms of M.P.H no longer interested me I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast When I am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then I embody the rhythms of the universe I am in a state of grace
Whooee
When I was younger I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
You 're the best
I 'm the best
Hitchhiking
Yep
So now you 're bummin around
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off
For magazines
I was a successful model once
Are you in show business
American Cheese The king of road food
Thanks
You bet your raggedy white ass I am
Going north
COUNTESS Sissy You 're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches Well let your conscience be your guide as my mommy used to say but it wo n't work Those stinking sluts are going to suffer
I do n't know anything about it
COUNTESS Sissy do n't play dumb with me You 're a good model but a shitty actress The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance You know perfectly well they are Last seen in Nebraska Did n't make it to Canada Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake And who else but Jellybean 's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds How much do you know about it Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
COUNTESS Good good good you 'll enjoy it you 'll see Julian is a gentleman
Well okay I 'll try it I do n't see the point in it but I 'll try it Just for you It 's kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in New York City However
COUNTESS I ca n't be certain that you would But what have you got to lose
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship
COUNTESS Yes well what I 'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity She ca n't wait too long you know Now there 's no reason why you must lose yours I mean just ponder it a bit that 's all
Why yes technically Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close but he was afraid of me I think
COUNTESS But here you are still a virgin you are virginal yet are n't you
COUNTESS Now now Do n't get exasperated I realize that you 've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and I might add you 've been wise Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage For men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics The male gets his food bed laundry TV pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he does n't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about But for a woman marriage is surrender
But Countess
COUNTESS Purely personal I believe you might enjoy one another
If you do n't want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him
COUNTESS Shit O dear that 's enough to make me asthmatic The nerve of those twits What do they know about female odor Do n't interrupt Here 's my concept My ranch out West It 's a beauty ranch Oh it 's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes But it 's a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows mainly can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment My ranch is named the Rubber Rose after the Rubber Rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world So get this It 's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence Well these cranes stop off at my little pond Siwash Lake it 's called twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do I 've never seen them understand but I hear they 're magnificent Very big specimens I mean huge mothers and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads Now whooping cranes in case you did n't know it are noted for their mating dance It 's just the wildest show in nature It 's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons Picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground Dears it 's overwhelming And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV Right there on the home screen creation 's most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground In a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum And a can of Dew Off-camera a string quartet is playing Debussy A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love Are you starting to get it Does n't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud My very goodness gracious Grandiose lyrical erotic and Girl Scout oriented you ca n't top it I 've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios the best wildlife cinematographers around You 're my eternal favorite Princess Grace herself could n't be better not even if she had your personality which she does n't Anyway dear I 'm out of photography now and into water colors Ah how circuitous conversation is We 're back at the beginning The exact man I 've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
COUNTESS I am once more about to make advertising history And only you the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl could possibly assist me
A job for me
COUNTESS Sissy Sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways The Countess has arranged a job for you And what a job
COUNTESS Oh my dear yes I bought a little ranch out West sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder A tax write-off actually
Your ranch
COUNTESS She 's a young thing who works on my ranch Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that She 's cute as a hot fudge taco and of course it takes verve to change one 's name so charmingly But she stinks like a slut just the same
COUNTESS What Oh yes Tee-hee Jellybean
Bonanza Jellybean
COUNTESS You were the Yoni Yum girl from let 's see from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy You 've always smelled so nice Like a little sister The irony has just killed me You the Dew Girl one of the few girls who does n't need Dew I loath the stink of females They are so sweet the way God made them then they start fooling around with men and soon they 're stinking Like rotten mushrooms like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool like a tuna fish 's retirement party They all stink From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean they stink
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me
COUNTESS Shit O goodness you wo n't be thirty for another year and you 're more beautiful than ever
I 've always been proud of the way nature singled me out It 's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for I 've been steady moving for eleven years and some months Maybe I should rest up for a spell I 'm not as young as I used to be
COUNTESS Freak schmeek Most of us are freaks in one way or another Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you 'll see what I mean
A born freak can only go uphill
COUNTESS That 's the very first time in the eons that I 've known you that I 've ever heard you complain And now you 're tired poor darling
Tired
COUNTESS To my own special Sissy Cheers And welcome So my letter brought ya flying eh Where were you Salt Lake City La Conner Well I may have a little surprise for you But first tell me about yourself It 's been six months has n't it In some circles that 's half a year How are you
I think I found something
Justin
Holy shit
I 'm in the Second Containment area It 's pitch black in here There must have been a coolant leak Man this shit is everywhere I ca n't see a damn thing
Shit Do not do that Where the fuck are you
Uh yeah Coop I 'm still here
do you copy
I 'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it Now step aside old man
You still need the rope I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins
So if the ship did n't blow up what happened
I can see why they sent you along
I heard it
That means top-secret Cooper
I am your best friend I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
Ballast
It worked for Weir Prep the tanks
Will it work
You prep the gravity couches I 'm going to manually arm those explosives
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before
On my way
Captain Miller we 're ready to repressurize the Clark
I 'll get him
But Justin
Hold on Coop
The containment Second Containment
Coop where are you
We have a man down
I 'll be all over it
You 've had plenty EVA Coop it 's Justin 's turn Stay on station If anything happens
come on Skipper I already put my shoes on
You 're convinced the crew could still be alive After seven years
From what
EVERYBODY SHUT UP Let the man speak
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission
This is Cooper what the hell do you do on this ship anyway
You can call him Baby-bear he loves that
Okay listen up As you all know by now we have an addition to our crew Dr Weir this is Starck navigation Smith pilot Justin ship 's engineer
Do n't start with me Cooper
Time to play Spam in the can
Roger that
Smith clear that airlock man I 'm coming in
Solid as a rock Hey Smith
We 're still venting trace gasses gim me twenty minutes to plug the hole
It 's holding She 's holding
What about the accumulator
We 'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU
You 're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel do n't you It fell down
Shit Smith you 're going Biblical on me
You heard me This ship it 's crazy trying to go faster n light that 's like the Tower of Babel
What
I 'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can This ship is bad It watches you
You been out there a long time Trying to break my record
I know what I saw and it was n't a fucking optical effect
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
I 'm telling you I saw it
I do n't know what happened to Justin
Saw what Mr Cooper What did you really see because what you 're describing is not physically possible
You were n't there I saw it
No he did n't
It was like nothing was there and then Justin appeared and the Core became metal
Skipper do we get hazard pay for this
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months It seems impossible but in light of the transmission I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
No thank you
Coffee
What
Damn Dr Weir do n't scare us like that Coffee
Run
What
Hurry
I 'm gon na activate the emergency beacon
I do n't want to go where the last crew went I 'd rather be dead
I do n't know the process Dr Weir was the expert
Can you shut it down
There must be a way What about Engineering
How The Bridge is gone
You 're okay now it 's over
Let me breathe let me breathe
I do n't know the screens are dead
What 's happening
It is not
Is that an offer
Oh God
Please kill
Oh God DJ what do I how do I
Please
Weir He used one of the explosives from the Corridor
What happened
DJ The Clark 's gone Smith and Cooper are dead
No I do n't believe in that sort of thing But if Dr Weir is right this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe of reality Who knows where this ship has been What it 's seen And what it 's brought back with it
Save yourself From Hell What are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
It sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi Hell
Hear what
Do you hear it Right there
It gets worse
It 's not a distress call It 's a warning
They thought it said Liberatis me Save me but it 's not me It 's tutemet Save yourself
Go on
I 've been listening to the transmission And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation
What is it
No
I I tried to go back for him to save him but I could n't get to him in time The fire Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity It 's like a liquid it slides over everything It was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire And then he was gone I never told anyone until now But this ship knew DJ It knows about the Goliath it knows about Corrick It knows our secrets It knows what we 're afraid of And now you 're going to tell me it 's carbon dioxide
Another man Who
Of course not Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it Just one of those things I swore I 'd never lose another man I came close today Real close
We 'll make it
He 'll live if we ever make it back
I do n't need sleep DJ I need answers
To conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity Anyone who can should get some sleep
Goddammit DJ it was not a hallucination I saw a man he was on fire And then he disappeared
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
His vitals are stable but he 's unresponsive to stimuli He might wake up in fifteen minutes He might not wake up at all
How is he
No time We need whatever 's left in our suits to repair the Clark Like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
We have n't tested the air yet It could be contaminated
And this is mission specialist Dr William Weir We all know where we 're going Dr Weir is going to tell us why
Trauma
He 's a rescue technician Peters medical technician DJ
One thing at a time let 's keep him breathing Start the drip 15cc 's fibrinogen Christ he 's bleeding out
His peritoneum has ruptured
Intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
He 's crashing
90 over 50 and falling
Pressure
I 've got a pulse he 's alive
You did n't hear it You must have heard it
What 's wrong
A power drain
What 's happening
Nothing It 's nothing
What 's wrong
Do n't thank me Bill I 'm not doing you any favors
Thank you
It 's against my better judgement but I 'll run this by the Man downstairs You 'll know my decision by the end of the day
A written briefing ca n't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this I have to go with them
That ship was lost in deep space seven years ago If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor I 'd find it more plausible Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team investigate the source of the transmission If it really is the Event Horizon they 'll attempt a salvage We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship 's systems for the salvage crew
It 's the Event Horizon She 's come back
I would n't bring you here on a hoax Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D codes
Incredible These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened This is n't some kind of hoax
I apologize for the short notice Bill but we 've had something come up that requires your immediate attention Lyle
You wanted to see me Admiral
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt she 's docked in bay four
I want our best people on this Where 's Miller
Some things you do n't get over
It 's been two years since she died He 's over it
He does n't belong on this mission Responsible or not he blames himself He 's too close to it And then there 's his wife
What 's on your mind
Does he know that
That does n't mean a damn thing They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill But he 's not responsible for what happened to the ship
The official inquiry blamed Weir 's design for the ship 's loss
You do n't just dismiss Bill Weir The man held Oppenheimer 's chair at Princeton If the Event Horizon had worked he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein
You 're not seriously considering sending him
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel This was the only response
It 's not that simple Lyle play the recording for Dr Weir
Starck
Oh my god OH MY GOD
From the Other Place
The dark inside I do n't understand
It 's inside and it eats and eats until there 's nothing left
The dark inside me
What does
It wo n't stop it goes on and on and on
What Justin what shows you
I 'm going in
That 's the Second Containment Seal Beyond that engineering
I 've reached another containment door This thing 's huge
Background radiation Perfectly safe
We still have pressure The radiation count 's steady at 7 millirads an hour
You 've reached the First Containment Seal The engineering decks are on the other side
I built it
How do you know all this
is zero That 's what the singularity does it folds space so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time After the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal It 's called a gravity drive
Justin I wo n't let you die
But I ca n't I got ta get out of here Skipper please
You 're not going to die Not today I want you to do exactly as I say and I 'm gon na get you out of there alright
I do n't want to die
Skipper you got ta help me
Justin
Patch me through to him
Almost done I just got ta check one thing
Justin finish your sweep
Yes sir
Okay We do it the hard way Deck by deck room by room Starck deploy the umbilicus I believe you 're up for a walk Mr Justin Go get your bonnet on
Start the countdown
Everything green on my boards Skipper
Someone sent that message Admiral you have to put me on that ship
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months They 're been gone seven years
The crew Could they still be alive
Since the initial transmission there 's been no further contact Just the beacon every two minutes
This is not about my reputation This is not about me at all The Event Horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds Seven years ago we did n't just lose the ship and the crew We lost the dream I have to go
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation Dr Weir but it does n't factor into this
I designed the ship 's propulsion system I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive You ca n't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed That would be like like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle
Dr Weir you have no experience with salvage procedures
Dr Weir Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
This is Weir
Thanks
I 'll get back to the log But on the bridge I wo n't go back back in there
Peters We need to know what happened to the crew Before it happens to us
Justin
That 's a negative Starck
Do it
I can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
Fine Starck I want you to repeat the bio-scan
I can use the station in Medical keep an eye on Justin
Peters I want you to go through the ship 's log see if we ca n't find some answers
Yeah I 'm I 'm okay
you okay
Peters
Skipper
Can anybody hear me
Crystallized
how 's the client
Justin check the containment for radiation leaks Peters
Frozen
Alive
I found one
The science workstation has power I 'll see if I can find the crew from here
Everything 's been shut down Conserving power I guess Green light on the hull it 's intact
What you got Peters
Okay I 'm on the bridge
There 's no one here Skipper
The blood came from somewhere Peters
Starck you still showing those readings
I can see the hatch
I do n't know this place is really dark I ca n't see a thing
Peters is right no one 's here
So where are they Starck any luck with the bio-scan
That means they did n't abandon ship
Ice crystals everywhere This place is a deep freeze
Jesus its huge
Clear and open on my mark Three two one mark
We 've got pressure
I am sorry But now we have to go to work
No no its alright I talked to my ex he 'll keep Denny over Christmas and I 'll get him this summer Goddam it Skipper I have n't seen him in two months
I put in for a replacement for you but no one
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers Good for four months
What 's the hold up
NOOO
You ca n't have them Go to hell
Starck Cooper
I 'm not asking you to believe me You 'll see for yourself and so will your crew You 're all coming with me
You 're lying
There is no Devil There is no God There is only NOTHING
Better if I just show you
Then what what are you Tell me
I 'm not the Devil
You want me to believe you 're the Devil well I do n't that 's bullshit
You know
What are you
Your fear Do you remember the Goliath Miller
Then who the fuck are you
Weir is dead
What makes you think I 'll miss
If you miss me you 'll blow out the hull You 'll die too
Do you know what a singularity is Miller Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is It is NOTHING Absolute and eternal NOTHING And if God is Everything then I have seen the Devil It 's a liberating experience
What are you talking about
I do n't need them anymore Where we 're going we wo n't need eyes to see
Your eyes
Son of a bitch
I told you She wo n't let you leave
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark doctor or you 'll find yourself looking for a ride home
You ca n't leave She wo n't let you
Watch me
You You ca n't do that
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed Fuck this ship
What about my ship
It 's done
Do n't do n't do this
Maybe you 're right But it 's still my command and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew And I think there is Starck download all the files from the Event Horizon 's computers Coop Smith finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark
You 're insane You 've lost your mind
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship The crew is dead Dr Weir This ship killed them And now it 's killing us
You ca n't your orders are specific
We 're leaving
That 's exactly what we do n't have Doctor
I DO N'T KNOW I do n't know There 's a lot of things going on here that I do n't understand Truth takes time
The Other Place what is that
I do n't know
Where has it been for the past seven years
I do n't know
To what Where did this ship go Where did you send it
Yes
You said this ship creates a gateway
What do you want me to say
That 's bullshit and you know it You built this fucking ship and all I 've heard from you is bullshit
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations
I want to know what caused that noise I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
Justin just tried to kill himself The man is clearly insane
Is that your expert opinion The only answer we 've had out of you is I do n't know
Do it
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
We 're a long way from home and we 're in a bad place Let 's not make it worse If anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time
Check the Core for radiation Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
We do n't get the power back our air 's gon na go bad
The Core
We barely have enough power for life support as it is if we ca n't stop the drain we 're not gon na make it
I do n't know
What the hell is that Dr Weir
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time it 's possible Black holes make sense on paper it 's all math you see but as to what really happened The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like Lazarus returned from the dead
Explanation
Exactly The ship 's internal clock is off by seven years
It 's 2041
The Event Horizon 's computer think 's it 's 2034
What about it
The date
You have something Dr Weir
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart It may have killed one of my men No one goes near that thing
There 's no danger The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it 's under control
I want this room sealed The Second Containment is off limits
If it worked yes
If it worked
Insane The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star The Event Horizon could be there in a day
It 's insane
How much time do you need We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes Now what is in the Core
It 's complicated
What could cause them What 's in the Core
It 's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core distorting space-time They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark
Hold on what 's this gravitational distortion
One of my men is down I want to know what happened to him
Yes
Dr Weir 's right Get on board the Event Horizon I 'll meet you at the airlock
It beats dying Mister Smith
They 're empty Dr Weir Moving forward
No one
Negative
Any survivors
Captain Miller the foredecks are just ahead
Easy Peters we 're okay we 're okay Let 's finish the sweep
In an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship That way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
I can see that what 're they for
Peters and I will search the forward decks Justin take Engineering No hot-dogging not on this one alright
You 're in the central corridor It connects the personnel areas to Engineering
once we 've secured the ship that 's the way it is I need you to guide us from the comm station This is where I need you Help us to do our job
That is not acceptable
Once the ship is secured we 'll bring you on board
Captain I did n't come out here to sit on your bridge I need to be on that ship
Dr Weir I need you on the bridge
Be careful It 's not a load bearing structure
Smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
That 's the engineering containment And there 's the main airlock We can dock there
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
What does it say
That 's what we 're here to find out
Where has it been for the last seven years
It was the ship 's maiden voyage to test the drive The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive And the ship vanished from all our scopes No radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind They disappeared without a trace Until now
Until then do what you 're told and stay out of my way
I 've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space
Doctor Weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to We were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no one 's even told us why
Captain Miller I appreciate this opportunity
The clock is running Dr Weir If you 'll follow the rest of the crew they 'll show you to the gravity tanks
Captain Miller I just want to say
Smith Smith Fuck
Where is it where is it
Get out of there now
No no we just got her back together
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor I think Weir may have put it on the Clark
Come again Skipper
Smith get out of there
I just saw Weir I think he was messing around on the Clark
What is it Smith
Skipper
Alright Prep the Clark for launch I 'll find her
She was right behind me I turn around she 's gone She could be anywhere
Now what
Captain we got a problem
Thank you
Get outside go back to work I 'll join you shortly
Sir
That 's enough
you break all the laws of physics you think there wo n't be a price You already killed the first crew
Understood
We do n't have time Smith In twenty hours we run out of air
I 've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize it 's gon na take some time
I 'm here Smith how 's the Clark
Captain Miller you copy
You heard me Smith Peters are you with me
But
They 're gone
No one 's dying on my watch Smith What about the reserve tanks
We 're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked In three minutes our atmosphere will be gone We are fucking dead
We do n't have time to fart
Do we have enough time for a weld
We have a situation here
Smith where the hell have you been
Captain Miller
Starck give me a read
It is now We 're locked in
Love to
Put it through TACS Smith you up for a flyby
Starck
Proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 we 're right on top of it we 're gon na hit
Where is it
1500 meters We 're getting too close
I noticed Starck anybody home
We 've got some weather
Dr Weir
Yes sir
I guess we 're about to find out Keep us slow and steady
Something like that yeah
What are you trying to say If God had intended Man to fly he would have given us wings
That 's not it That ship was built to go faster than light That 's just wrong it goes against everything we know
We 're all on edge Smith We 're a long way out
Bring us in tight Starck get on the horn see if anyone 's listening
We have a lock on the Event Horizon 's navigation beacon It 's in the upper ionosphere we 're in for some chop
One-four degrees
Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
Heading three-three-four
What is that
Jesus
Locked and cocked
I do n't like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go Is the course locked in
He 's dead
Weir
Miller he 's back he was in the tank
repeat we 're armed
We 're armed This fucker 's ready to blow
No I 'll be right back
I 'll do it
We blow the Corridor Use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship We stay put
Blow it up
BLOW THE FUCKER UP
We 've got to shut it down we 've got to
Weir activated the drive He 's sending us to the Other Place
Whatever was on that bridge was n't Weir
Weir ca n't be alive
Five seconds
Tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
You better hurry He 's engaged the override we ca n't open the inner door
I 'm on my way Starck
Stay here Do n't stop working
He 's awake he 's in the airlock he 's not wearing a suit
What
Justin 's in the airlock
What 's going on in there Starck
Miller come in
I 'm going outside to work on the Clark And Starck do n't tell anyone what you just told me We 've got enough to worry about
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes
What I want is to survive the next ten hours
I thought you wanted an answer And that 's the only one I have
If you knew it was impossible then why 'd you waste my time
I know that
Starck do you know how crazy that sounds It 's impossible
It 's not bullshit it 's the only conclusion the data supports
We 're hanging on by our fingernails and you 're giving me bullshit stories
I did n't say that I said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
To what What are you saying This ship is alive
You 've got to listen
There was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged What if there were a connection between the two The gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system
Go ahead
I 've got a theory
bio-readings of indeterminate origin do n't you have anything useful to tell me
I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin
What is it Starck
Miller
Dr Weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
Who
No It was someone else
Maybe one of the original crew
Do it Dr Weir
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12 amylase proteins
Not acceptable I want to know what 's causing those readings If the crew is dead I want the bodies I want the crew found
What 's the point I 'll just get the same thing
So where is the rest of the crew We 've been over every inch of this ship and all we 've found is blood Dr Weir Any suggestions
I do n't know but whatever it is it 's not the crew
What 's causing the readings
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing Bio-readings of indeterminate origin Right before that wave hit the Clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now it 's back to its previous levels
What about the life readings you picked up
I thought of that with the filters from the Clark we 've got enough breathable air for twenty hours After that we 'd better be on our way home
We can take the filters from the Clark
It 's building up with every breath we take And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot
Carbon dioxide
Oxygen is not the problem
How much oh-two do we have
The antennae array 's completely fried we 've got no radio no laser no highgain No one 's going to be coming to help us
But you can breathe it
It tastes bad
Okay Let 's find out how much time we just bought
We 're all here
Everybody okay
Keep your eyes open
That 's an affirmative
There 's not enough radiation to throw off the scan I 'm picking up trace life forms but I ca n't get a lock on the location
Radiation interference
Something 's wrong with the bio-scan
Come around to three-three-four
Crossing the horizon Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
Then what are you doing here Come on people let 's go And Cooper Put some pants on
I just finished drying
Starck why are n't you on the bridge
Let 's go
Ion drive will engage in T-minus ten minutes
Justin
We 're past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever you 're ready
I 've seen bodies before This is different
Is n't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
About an hour ago In medical I saw my son He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were
I did
No I saw nothing
There 's no one here
Can you see a body
Blood Looks like arterial spray
Yes we can see some kind of mist What is that
You 're at the Bridge Ms Peters You still have n't seen any crew
Dr Weir what 's this the door to
They 're explosive charges
Here 's another one They 're all over the place
DJ It 's okay You 're okay Just breathe
Claire
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan The shuttle 's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen There was a spark and both ships were incinerated The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat Captain Miller was able
Was n't that ship destroyed
He served on the Goliath
He 's been past Mars
Do n't worry about it He 's hard but he 's fair You 're lucky to be shipping out with him He 's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach
Yes
First time in a grav couch
I do n't care
It 's cold
You got any coffee
Skipper Justin just activated the door It 's on a thirty second delay
We have to do something oh God
Come on Baby-bear open this door
Almost got it
Do you know what it was
Keep him talking
Yes Yes Justin we heard it
Can you shut it down
He 's engaged the override
Not according to the computer
There 's no one in the corridor but us
Hey You do n't need to be a scientist figure it out
Thank you for that scientific analysis Mister Smith
I did n't see anything and I do n't have to see anything This ship is fucked
It still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
What
We 're losing atmosphere
The safety circuit 's failed
That 's the Core the gravity drive The heart of the ship
What the hell is that
Shit Doc any closer and we 're gon na need a rubber
Foredecks Crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area Can we move in closer
She 's not ugly
Jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
Dead ahead 5000 meters
Where is she
Say this paper represents space-time and you want to get from point A here to point B here Now what 's the shortest distance between two points
Hey
I do n't think this is a good idea we do n't even know what happened on that ship
What if the air has gone bad We ca n't wear these suits forever
I 'm trying goddammit
Get them back
Miller do you read me Peters
Decompression would n't do that
Explosive decompression
What happened to his eyes
Picking up magnetic interference
Range 500 meters and holding Turbulence is dropping off
1000 meters
The scope is lit it 's right in front of us
Range 3000 meters and closing
If they are they 're screening their calls
Matching speed now Range to target ten thousand meters and closing Skipper I got a bad feeling about this
This is U.S Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark hailing Event Horizon Event Horizon do you read This is the Lewis and Clark hailing
The law of relativity prohibits faster than-light travel
You ca n't do that
All boards are green everything 's five by five
30 hours to Neptune orbit
Smith 's right Neptune There 's nothing out there If something happens we 'll be on our own
I ca n't believe this I have n't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit Why not Mars Cap Mars has women
It means nothing
Justin said something about The dark inside me What did he mean
Miller Smith Cooper any of you in the airlock
The forward airlock
What is it
I 'm alright Please
In our current environment Dr Weir self-control is an asset
It wants me I have to go
What are you doing
No there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind It 's as if time just stopped for seven years
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system
I 'm sorry
Yes I miss her She died Two years now
It must be hard being so far away from her
Yes
Claire is your wife
Hmmm Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her I told her that was n't true I just knew the Event Horizon better that 's all
Why Dr Weir I think you 're in love
I ca n't believe we built this
That 's how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black hole 's immense gravitational power to create the gateway That 's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light
I do n't know The life readings just went off the scale
What is it
Ship 's log
What is it
If they were in stasis I 'd get a location but these readings they 're all over the ship It does n't make any sense
Could it be the crew If they were in suspended animation would n't that effect the scan
Affirmative The hull 's intact but there 's no gravity and the thermal units are off line I 'm showing deep cold The crew could n't survive unless they were in stasis
Do they have pressure
The reactor 's still hot We 've got several small radiation sources leaks probably Nothing serious
Wrong The shortest distance between two points
A straight line
Well in layman 's terms you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
How
Relativity yes We ca n't break the law of relativity but we can go around it The ship does n't really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another light years away
I like the sound of that
We 're going to have to work on your touch
My step-dad 's I 'm strictly into stone I was wondering when you 'd walk by
Those yours too
No I mean I 'm a little dusty
Relax it 's casual
I 'm not really dressed for a party
I 'm blind not deaf Wan na come in
How 'd you know it was me
Trust me this ai n't one of those times
Such a sad face You know sometimes being different is n't a bad thing
You would n't say that if you could see me
I do n't think She 's real big on hate
Tell me When you grew up in Brooklyn how many astronauts did you know You went your own way then You did n't listen to people So why start now
THING I mean
I would n't know anything about that
THING You do n't know what it 's like out there Walking around like some kind of circus freak People staring whispering
THING This ai n't permanent My friend Reed 's working on a cure I think
Sensual blind chick seeks three ton rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship
THING You know you could a run an ad in the personals
Victor must 've taken him
Where is Reed
No it 's not I thought I was done waiting for Reed We 're all in this together now Ben
It 's easy for you to be patient
Just give Reed a little more time You know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one
It 's not him It 's them I ca n't live like this
He did n't mean it You know Johnny He 's always been a hothead
What did he do to the uniform
Oh he did
He did n't
I would n't be caught dead in that
The suit will stretch You should try it
You look like an eighties rock band
Well why did n't you say so You want me to lift some weights or something
We need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped
Would n't want to keep Vic waiting
I can only stay for one drink Ben I 've got to meet with Victor
Is it safe
We can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here
Victor did
I can handle the ship I can even handle Mr Blonde Ambition But I do n't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits Who the hell came up with them
I 'll schedule the launch Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
Way to not overthink it So when do we leave
And you can Power it up
He could n't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass Yet another mistake for Mr Fantastic
He also said we 'd avoid that storm in space And we know how that turned out
Reed said it 'd be weeks till
To help you I 've run every test known to man And they all yield the same result the machine is ready
What do you want Vic
Where do you think With Sue
What is this Where 's Reed
Ben come in
Come on Let me buy you something to eat Looks like you could use the company
About me How sweet
I 'm worried about you
What are you doing here
I already got it Everything I want
What did you wish for honey
Deb it 's me It 's still me
Oh my G-g-g What did you do to Ben
Baby you 're scaring me
Do n't come any closer for a sec This is gon na be kind of a shock You remember when we said together forever no matter what
Ben
Out front You home baby I got a surprise for you
Deb It 's me I need you to step out front
I do n't care about rocks I care about you You bring him back in one piece or you can forget being Best Man
Soon as I 'm back I 'm gon na trade that in for a bigger rock
Just get back soon or I start looking for a new groom
I 'll be watching over you
Forget it egghead I 'm good as is
Ben I 've been crunching the numbers on the machine I think if we can rework the power settings
Got it teach
Time for your lesson Vic Chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal Ben
Ben I do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse I need you to be patient for a little while longe
Glad nothing could take you away from your work
Yeah I can tell Victor was right
We 're working as hard as we can
Oh you remember my name do you You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body
Ben
This is n't permanent Johnny We need to be careful until we 're normal again
It 's about to be a broken face
O-kay We 'll skip that question
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
Ben I 'm afraid I 've got to ask
Yeah You do n't wan na know the details
Okay I 've uh got some questions from Sue That she thought might be better coming from me Can you you know go to the bathroom like normal
If we 're going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes
You got a chisel round here
Yeah nine years straight
We had a tough year
Am I okay You wan na explain that
Ben Are you okay
What the
I think I need to lie down Bad shrimp
Are you alright
Well maybe you should date him
He 's smart powerful successful
I 'm sorry did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws
What Come on She 's got a good thing with Victor
Reed I 'm not talking about Debbie
Yeah you and Debbie and perfect
You go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life
I should have done more run more tests
Reed Even you ca n't compute every little thing
I do n't know I just keep going over and over the numbers
Solid
Three days I was worried about you How are you feeling
How long was I out
Ben This is serious Turn around
I ai n't done arranging your flowers egghead
Should
The shields on the station should protect us
Victor 's better at these things
This is your dream Reed You should be the one up there
He 's made a few changes
Is n't that your speech
This makes five
I had it at four
Five times
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do
I 'm sure he 's matured since then
They crashed it into a wall A flight simulator
Youthful high spirits
No I can not take orders from that underwear model That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator
External SRBs orbital system engines Its just like the shuttles you flew in
Ca n't do it I can not do it
I know I know I 'm just worried about what he wants Speaking of which
We got what we wanted That 's enough
Maybe you should think about yourself for once You always let this guy push you round
Ben think about all the people we can help if this works
He knew about NASA What if he made the call to shut us down
Ben the money 's not important We could save lives
What about his first born
Ben This is business Just work
I ca n't take this
You 'd never know it
He 's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century
This was n't our first stop in case you forgot NASA And Victor 's not that bad He 's just a little Larger than life
Good thing it ai n't workin Reed what are we doing here This guy 's fast-food strip-mall science
Hey I 'm Mr Sensitivity now Clear the way wide load coming through
No more cracks about how I look
Really With a name like Von Doom Never saw that one coming
The machine works And Vic 's gone Mister Hyde on us
Go back to the drawing board
Hey That 's a prototype
Give me the god damn mirror
They said that 's not such a good idea the shock alone could
Give me a mirror
I swear to you they 've done everything humanly possible The best plastic surgeons in the world Ben You had the best
What 's wrong with me
They 're fine Everybody else is fine
Reed Sue
Back on Earth Victor 's medical facility We 're in quarantine
Where where am I
Do n't you wander off boy
Put your tiny little mind at ease
Let 's see you got Victor stud of the year more coin than God Or Reed the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp Hmmm it 's a toss-up
Hey two hearts got busted last time Maybe she 's not over it either
Yeah well his eyes say different
'Course not Strictly business
Please tell me your dawg 's not trying to rekindle things with my sister
Keep talking there wo n't be a next time
If you behave maybe next time daddy 'll let you drive
Actually the engines are SMEs Hydrogenbase carbon propellant Couple generations past your last ride I 'm not as dumb as you look
What the hell you smiling at Just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those SMBs
That 's terrible news
But this disease is progressive degenerative
The Center for Disease Control If this thing is contagious
What
I wish I could tell you I ca n't pretend to know what we 're dealing with here I 'll notify the CDC and
What do you mean complete
At this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks
Like the shields Reed said would protect us How long
I do n't really know A compound organic-metallic alloy Stronger than titanium or carbon steel Harder than diamonds
And they 're changing into
Your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing Every system is still functioning somehow
NURSE No You 're ON FIRE
Not this again
NURSE You 're on fire
NURSE Last one down springs for room service
I though we went over this
NURSE Stay right Left is trouble
Me like-y
Meet me at 4:01 top of the run That 'll give you a minute to freshen up
NURSE My shift ends at four but I could n't
I 've never felt better in my life When do you get off work
NURSE I mean you feel a little feverish
So are you
NURSE You 're hot
I do n't know if we 've noticed but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window
NURSE And where do we think we 're going
Now
But all these people
Johnny SUPERNOVA
A higher calling like getting girls and making money
Act Here we go again Reed what if we got these gifts for a reason What if we have some you know like calling
You need to control yourself and think before you
Right whatever have fun
That 's what I 'm trying to calculate And it 's not rubber It 's muscle tendon I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to
They 're not costumes
He 's right These costumes are missing something I ca n't put my finger on it
Oh well that 's easy I 'm hot You 're well you 're a little limp Sue 's easy to see through And Ben 's always been a hardass Why are n't you writing this down
What No I 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
What are you trying to say Just because I dress well and like to dance
Is there something about flames About flaming that you
Gotcha Okay Supernova bad
Not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to Earth 's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it
I can go hotter
Back it down Johnny
and figure out how to reverse them Let me show you to your rooms
This place is deluxe You got cable
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
Oh it is
Twenty From outside the place looks a lot taller
What he 's trying to say is every team needs a mascot
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who 's been through a terrible orde
You 've been working out
This is wrong in so many ways
Ben are you there
Oh you dawg you Better not be my nurse
Cool What 'd it do to you guys
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA
Now what is up with that
Ben Ben
He 's not responsive
What about you
Victor 's right Johnny get to the command center Close the shields
But Johnny you ca n't fly
Sis Let me take care of you for once
What are you doing
No I 'm sorry for pushing you out
I 'm sorry sis for leaving you guys
As soon as you stop acting like one Come on you 're smarter than this You think those people out there care about you You 're just a fad to them
Look around sis She 's not here So you can stop talking to me like I 'm your little boy
Johnny slow down Think You know mom did n't raise us to
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody 's science project
Is that what you call it Real
Yeah for the last time I hope I 'm done with this freak show I 'm moving back to the real world
Johnny Did you see Ben
Blockhead started it
You two need a time-out
You gave us names What are you the face of the Fantastic Four now
You 're gon na pay for that Pebbles What
Dude That 's my sister
I 'm driving
Girl
Uh we call my sister the invisible girl the Invisible Girl
That 's the temperature of the sun
Sweet
You were at 4000 Kelvin Any hotter you 're approaching supernova
You 're really cramping my style here
Is that a trick question C'mon I ca n't be the only one who thinks this is cool
Grow up Johnny You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
Wait You mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic
I think that thing is Ben
What is that thing
Okay mom
Stop it
Johnny
Flame on flame off Flame on flame off
Please tell me you go silent too
Apparently I can disappear
Keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
The synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to
Top left like you asked Today Wall Street Tomorrow who knows maybe Washington
Front page
Yes sir You 've got the Mayor at eight then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal
Make sure you find Ben bring him back here And keep it quiet I do n't need this to hit the press
That 's why Because I could have any other woman You know when they asked Caesar why England he said because it 's not mine
Sir I 've always wondered Why Sue You could have any woman in the world but
Later First I 've got some unfinished business A deal that needs closing
You know maybe you should get some rest
And that 's a good thing
Actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
Get me on the AM shows Larry King cover of the Journal I 've got to do something about this scar Make sure they only shoot my right side
Sir I 'm sure he would n't put himself
Reed 's disaster You know I half think he did this to me on purpose
Stable We 're looking at low twenties It 's a good number considering the fallout from
How 's the IPO
Recording sir We see you perfectly
Leonard how 's the feed
History Leonard History Everything else is conversation How 's the other matter
Then what is it
It 's not just the money I could make money in my sleep
Our numbers are through the roof The IPO 's tracking at fifty sixty a share The bank 's five times oversubscribed
Showtime
They 're ready for you sir
Reed 's always right Good thing he does n't always know what he 's got
And if he 's not
If Reed 's right then this little trip will double our stock offering
A gasket Reed we 're at a party
I found a broken gasket from space
I 'm sure I can come up with something
Sue I need some of that anger rage frustration
You need a doctor
The power I need more power to control the storm
Reed stop you need to rest your
I can make it work
That would have kinda defeated the purpose And Reed I 'm saying it now
Why did n't you say something
When I walked out I waited ten minutes outside your door Ten Waiting for you to come find me
I did I did Reed but I wanted you to be that man
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you speak his mind One who was n't afraid to tell you what he wanted
I gave him twenty
You know I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
Of course I was I 'd read all your papers on bioethics Some of them two times just so I 'd have something to say to you
You were
Remember our first date here God I was so nervous
Reed Shh Just be quiet And look up
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter 's main power to generate enough voltage
I 'm not the only one in there I got you Vic Ben Johnny all rattling around in there
Every variable but yourself You do n't eat sleep You ca n't live in your head like
Which is why I 'm working twenty hours a day checking every variable
Better than your life Victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing We are
He was going to take away all my data equipment
Do n't let Victor push you into making a mistake
No way to know Without more tests experiments
Reed How close are we to a cure
With the right energy we can stabilize the storm Maybe tie into the city grid
And you sure you can control this thing Last time did n't work out so well
Of course Of course
But we 're the focus right Reed Reed
Curing countless diseases not just ours
And reverse the mutations
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm we can reverse the polarity
The plants from space Their particles are still charged With the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm
What are you doing
No There were n't There was you And me No variables no math It was actually the simplest thing in the world But your head got in the way like it always does
There were a lot of variables to consider
I just wanted to share an apartment What was so complicated about that
I think it was a little more complicated than
Reed I was ready for the next step you were n't ergo I walked
No I distinctly remember you walked out my door Ergo
Are you kidding
I mean you broke up with me right
What in the world would give me that idea
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I did n't mean to do that You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or
I 'm sure I can come up with something
Okay Is there any way to duplicate that feeling Some memory or
Anger Rage Frustration
I 'm saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger Can you remember the exact emotions when
Excuse me
You should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better
What about you You have n't eaten in days How come you 're never on this side of the microscope
It 's not invisibility per se You 're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field That 's what you projected on the Bridge
If it happened to him then it could
That 's what we 're here to find out
How come Ben ca n't turn it on and off like us
What Oh
Sue Your clothes Lose them
We need to get past them
What
Let 's not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
It has to be the cloud It 's fundamentally altered our DNA
Sue look at your hands
What What do you mean you
Uh Sue I ca n't
You are such a dork Reed You never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics
For science
Passion
Which was
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
You 're happy for me and Victor
You always had a way with words I should be getting back
That 's good That 's uh good
Yes thanks
Feeling better
Great minds think alike
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules I 've been working on a formula for this
Well he 's welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll You remember my brother Johnny
As far as crew I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission
It 's been changed
I uh think I remember the number
Right That 's exactly what I meant
Well uh based on our history you can handle the biogenetics and I 'll focus on the molecular physics Or uhm maybe I should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho
I was talking about us Working together
Those solar winds are flaring but I factored them into my coordinates and
Never better
You 're you 've I mean how have you bee
Which is precisely the point Analysis is over It 's time for action My men could have mass-produced this by now
But I 'm not done with the machine
What I should have done a long time ago Applications and patents Reed This all belongs to me
What are you doing here
I do n't want to understand it This is n't one of your science projects I just want to fix it Fast
Victor if we could understand what happened to us
Abort Reed I put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and I will not let you make me look like a fool
I ruined With all due respect I told you to abort
Did n't go as planned It was a catastrophe You ruined the lives of four people
Not much We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
I 'm starting to wonder the same thing How much do you know about what happened to you
He 's had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud And he 's not the only one
Ben did this
Ben did this
Just a little banged up A couple scrapes Why
It 's too late for him and soon it 'll be too late for all of us
Not until Ben is back inside
Reed we 're running out of time
Come on Ben come on
So reel him in But we came here to do a job So let 's do it Quickly
Ben 's still out there
Get a grip Reed We did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch Just close the shields
We 've got minutes until it hits not hours Victor that storm 's deadly the radiation 's lethal We need to abort
Sure
Got it So take a walk Ben I 'm going to borrow Susan for a second
Hilarious
Funny how things turn out is n't it
The number 's seventy-five And it 's applications and patents
You back this mission and I 'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or
Not at all
This is n't going to be a problem is it
You remember in school we talked about working together That 's what I was about to explain
But dreams do n't pay the bills do they Same old Reed the hopeless optimist Still reaching for the stars with the world on your back
Victor we ca n't do anything until the research is ready
Oh I think you already have
Please do n't make this personal
Then why is Reed dragging his feet Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass It 's ironic is n't it You 're finally the perfect woman for him because you 're his science project
If these molecules are n't stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us
Same old Reed All analysis no action Was n't that the problem with you two
He 's working round the clock But the data needs to be tested analyzed before
Susan What are you doing
Victor wait slow down a second I want you to know I appreciate everything you 've done for me but I just do n't
It is There 's something we need to talk about Something I need to ask you
You said it was urgent
Please no apologies I 've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos You 'll have round-the clock care
I 'm sorry I did n't get a chance to
I told you I 'm fine It 's you I 'm worried about
Victor your scar
Just find him
Victor I 'm sorry I
Victor are you feeling alright
What 's going on
You ca n't leave them out there
Raising the shields
What are you doing
Sue I 've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps And this is the biggest step yet If it helps think of this as a promotion A merger of sorts Four little words that can change our lives
Uh Victor I hope I have n't done something to make you think
Right of course the company But you see I 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with
It 's been a good two years Victor The company 's accomplished so much
Well when you 're looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past
I understand the business reasons
Surprised I agreed to Reed 's proposal
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research Susan Storm
It 's just business
THING Skeptical
For your sake I hope you 're right I 'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
THING Reed 's gon na fix me up
I 'm just saying I know what it 's like to lose something you love To see it slip away and know it 's never coming back
THING If you 're trying to cheer me up you 're doing a helluva job
I know it ca n't be easy Life has n't changed that much for Reed Sue and Johnny At least they can go out in public But for you People staring Whispering behind your back
THING 'Scuse me
All right
I can probably get you in there Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor
Oh man if you could swing something there I 'd do anything for you I want to work with you guys
You want to work at Carl 's
Brad I really fuckin hate McDonald 's man Ever since they started in with the chicken everything went downhill
Arnold What 's happening
Brad can I talk to you a minute
Look Brad I 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this We 're almost out of high school this is our last year I think we owe it to ourselves to be free and meet some new people Then if we get back together we 'll know it 's the right thing
I 'm just glad we 're still together Lisa because I need you this year
Apologize to that wimp No way Fuck Dennis Taylor
If you 'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back
Man I do n't even want to see those guys from Carl 's again
I do n't want to talk about it here Brad
Tool Tool for what We 've been going together almost two years
Brad I do n't want to have to use sex as a tool
What 's there to do at the Point God Lisa we 've been going together almost two years and
Do n't worry about it
How much did they cost
Of course
Were those flowers really for me Brad
Later
Easy mon
There it is
First door on your left
On the ledge
It 's the first door on your left
I ca n't find it mon
It 's the first door on your left
Totally
Go ahead Just make it quick
Come on Spicoli Why do n't you just put your shirts back on See the sign
Something happened to them mon
Yes I think so Show some pride Hamilton
You really want me to put all this stuff back on
Come on Hamilton You 're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips We have stores all over Southern California Part of our image part of our appeal is in our uniforms You know that
I thought I 'd take it off for the drive over to IBM It 's kind of uncomfortable
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform
This is how I dress all the time
Hamilton come over here What is that you 've got on
Manager
Mister if you do n't shut up I 'm gon na kick 100 of your ass
I am so tired I am so tired of dealing with morons How hard is it to
I 'm sorry sir Just let me find the forms here
Look Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my 2.75 back Okay Please Brad
I ca n't do that But if you wait a minute
See that sign It says 100 Money Back Guarantee Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee Do they teach you that here Give me my money back
Well that 's not the way it works really And you ate most of your food already too
No I want my money back right now
Well I believe you have to fill out a form There 's a pad right around here
All right then It 's your secret
No
You 're not going to tell me are you
Brad Please do n't tell Mom and Dad
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway
Thanks a lot Brad I really appreciate it
See you later

Well it pretty much speaks for itself Peter you want to run with it
I hear you brought a film clip with you Do you want to set it up for us
I do n't go at all
How often do you go
School School is no problem All you have to do is go to get the grades And if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time
I wanted to talk a little bit about school if I could
Seriously Merv everything is great I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend maybe going up to the mountains
I 've been swimming Merv
I was going to say your eyes look a little red
Outrageous Merv Nice to be here I feel great

This ai n't no cop
What the fuck is this guy doing
I like sex
All right
Suzanne Somers tits
Naw Any good
Seen the new Playboy
Then do n't hassle it
He is
I thought he was out of town
Hey slow down This is my brother 's car
Hey Doug Stallworth It 's his loss
There 's a world of guys out there I just wish I did n't have to date any of them
I ca n't believe it But what about Doug
I did n't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I 'd make it
Dartmouth
Well I might go to Dartmouth
But what are you going to do
Yeah like maybe never
Sometime
He says he 's got to stay in Chicago He says I should visit him sometimes
Not coming What happened
He 's not coming
Where 's Doug
Romance in Ridgemont We do n't even get cable TV
I want romance
What do you want
You know Linda I 've finally figured it out It 's not sex I want Anyone can have sex
Come on There 's lots of men around here Keep your eyes open
Another summer of working at Swenson 's
Stacy he 's not a guy He 's a little prick
Do n't do anything Linda I 'd rather just forget about it I do n't even like the guy
There goes your stereo for another year Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick I 'm not letting him get away with this
I paid for it and everything
That little prick
Then I called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father
That little prick
I really thought he would show up I waited and waited and waited
You 're right I did n't tell you that
You did n't tell me that they can be so nice so great but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they 're five years old
What
You know there 's one thing you did n't tell me about guys
But it costs money to have an abortion Even at the Free Clinic You tell Damone to pay for it It 's the least he can do It 's the guy 's responsibility too
I 'm not going to tell him He 's an asshole I hate him
Of course it was Damone If it was Ron Johnson you 'd be out to here
It could be I had a pregnancy test at the clinic I 'll find out Monday I guess it was Damone
It could n't be
What do you think it is
What do you think it is
I do n't know I just do n't feel right
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks
I do n't know I 'm just so depressed Everything is just so depressing
God Stacy it 's not that sad It 's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban
God I do n't think so Better look in the house
Stacy I 've got water in my ears Do you have any Q-Tips
I know He hates to have to wear uniforms
God he hardly even talks anymore
No
I did n't ask for any help Did you Linda
I think they 're both virgins
What do you think
He works for the airline He 'll be out here You 'll meet him
What 's Doug do in Chicago
I do n't know Thirty to forty minutes
How long does Doug take
Listen to this it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex but they do n't have real orgasms
No But it 's a nice idea
Does that ever happen
Climax together
All right Here 's another one 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together
You 're right Probably penis mouth and neck
Would n't penis and balls be the same category
Okay penis that 's one balls
Listen to this 'What are your mate 's three most erogenous zones
Why do n't you put your mother 's secret book back
You really ought to look at this Linda There 's a drawing on every page and all these quizzes It 's like school
I sent a letter to Doug today I 'll be so glad when he gets out here
Sixteen
Oh come on What is he Fifteen
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre You know Mark Ratner
Thanks a lot
Stacy How many times do I have to tell you You are really going to be beautiful someday
I should quit this job I 'm going to get so fat working here nobody will ever take me out
Stacy What does it matter He 's a stereo salesman You want to marry him You want to have kids with him You want this guy to come home fifty years old and he 's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on Come on
Do n't you think it meant anything to him Even if I am fifteen
Not since November
I guess Ron has n't called yet
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people
You 've got to get used to working Christmas People are always screaming and yelling then they get home and they 're all Christmasy
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games
If he ever calls again I 'll say I 'm eighteen
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like That 's why I 'm marrying him
Does Doug care that you 're seventeen
Do n't you dare you 'll never hear from him again
There There 's his car I know he 's at work tonight He has n't come into Swenson 's since he called my house My mother told him I was still at high school after I told him I was nineteen I guess I should tell him I 'm fifteen
Hey That 's my line
Come on Linda It 's just sex
So tell me do you like Ron Is it serious
It was nice
You 'll always remember your first time
It was okay
Was it great
Oh That 's where that group got its name from
Just kidding About 10cc
There 's nothing to it
Well I never did it
What 's the big deal
Like you know giving blow jobs
What variables
No there are variables that like I might not be good at
What do you mean 'better in bed You either do it or you do n't
Yeah but they look more sophisticated You 'd probably think they 'd be better in bed
Oh give me a break Stacy You 're much prettier than them
Do you think guys find that attractive
I know
Linda That girl looks just like Pat Benatar
God People exaggerate so much at this school
No way He just called him a dick
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr Hand this morning
Believe it
I ca n't believe I start high school tomorrow
If I did n't have a fiancé in Chicago I 'd go for it
He was hot was n't he
Stacy what are you waiting for You 're fifteen I did it when I was thirteen It 's no huge thing It 's just sex If you do n't one of the other girls will
Really
Face it With some guys you have to make the first move A lot of guys are just wussies
I ca n't do that
I called them If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer I 'd sit closer If I wanted to kiss him I 'd just do it You want Ron Johnson Grab him
So what did you do
Listen Stace you want to know about guys I 'll tell you They 're mostly chicken Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute I thought if I gave out a vibe they 'd get the message and call me up Well guess what They do n't call
Come on Linda I have n't had a boyfriend all summer You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change Do you think he 'll call this week
Should we buy a frame for that
He gave me his card 'Ron Johnson Audio Consultant
Just take his order look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny laugh a lot
What should I do
Come on Stacy it 's your section and your man
Yeah but I fucked up You can take it Really
Do n't you like him
Do you think that guy 's cute
How 's it going

Of course And now I have to get back to the news Send up some ice
What Ah yes yes I see what you mean Yes so you 'll be responsible then
Do n't worry You 're protected Just treat this poor woman like you 'd treat any other human being in trouble
Well certainly We 're always happy to cooperate with the police
Look you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again We 're watching her very carefully this woman has been into laudanum It 's a controlled experiment but I suspect we 'll need your cooperation before this thing is over
Well uh She did n't say Mr Duke But since I know you 're here with the Police Convention
Crying Why was she crying
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed I think she was crying
Tell me What do you want
Oh yes yes This terrible war When will it end
IN VIETNAM ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION
Killed
WHAT What was that crazy bitch said to him There 's a war on man People are being killed
Mr Duke Hello Mr Duke I 'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago I thought I should call again because I was wondering
Holy shit
Ah yes Mr Duke You have one message Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel room 1600
What 's the message My light is blinking
Well thank you
Do n't worry about a thing sir Just enjoy your stay
Oh and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey two fifths of Baccardi and a night 's worth of ice delivered to my room please
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible Can you have someone drive it around to the room
Certainly Mr Duke
Listen you fuzzy little shithead I 've been fucked around in my time by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it 's MY turn Fuck you officer I 'm in charge here and I 'm telling you we do n't have room for you
Of course I could hear what the Clerk was really saying
Righto
Let 's have lunch
Not for me
There 's no hurry The race is over
Look That telegram was all scrambled It was actually from Thompson not to him Western Union must have gotten the names reversed I have to get going I have to get out to the track
But he will be available Perhaps later this morning
Of course But if I were you I 'd leave the Doctor alone until after he 's eaten breakfast He 's a very crude man
Well the manager Mr Heem would like to meet him Nothing unusual Mr Heem likes to meet all our large accounts put them on a personal basis just a chat and a handshake you understand
Awake What do you mean
Tell me When will the doctor be awake
You did the right thing Never try to understand a press message About half the time we use codes especially with Dr Gonzo
What confused us was Dr Gonzo 's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles When we knew he was right here in the hotel
He is Do n't worry I 'll get it to him
I checked the register for this man Thompson We do n't show him but I figured he might be part of your team
Yes It makes sense
Sir This telegram came for you Actually it is n't for you It 's for somebody named Thompson but it says 'care of Raoul Duke Does that make sense
What
Dobermans do n't talk
Hell no We 'd never hear the goddamn end of it
WHAT
Cut their goddamn heads off Every one of them That 's what we 're doing in California
Naked
Naked
Not where we operate
Naw That 's science fiction stuff
Witchcraft Shit you ca n't mean it
They 're everywhere Nobody 's safe And sure as hell not in the South They like warm weather You 'd never believe it In L.A it 's out of control First it was drugs now it 's witchcraft
You 're another one of these California boys Your friend here 's been tellin us about dope fiends
Rum and ice please
You know what I mean We 've done it before and we can damn well do it again
What do you mean by that
You 're going to need to take the bull by the horns go to the mat with this scum
Hell I really hate to hear this Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way sooner or later Mostly Atlanta But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance They did n't roam around much But now Jesus it seems nobody 's safe
That 's how he got so big When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy
Really
He wanted the pineal gland
Naw Not a major
We know where he lives but we ca n't get near the house
A major
Yeh The big guy used to be a major in the Marines
And nobody did anything
Do Jesus Christ man They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood
What happened What did they do to her
Not down in my parts
They 'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives They might even sit on your wife 's chest Put the blade right down on her throat
Naw
You will One of these nights you 'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart
I 'm a whiskey man myself We do n't have much trouble from drugs where I come from
Do n't worry and I 'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County Just another good American like yourself
This is my granddaughter
Oh my God
That 's a fine combination You ca n't lose
I know I 'm a triple Scorpio
A great town that Vegas I bet you had good luck there You 're the type
Las Vegas
Where ya comin from young man
Wait a minute Come back and have a beer
Thanks for the ride Thanks a lot I like you guys Do n't worry about me
Never mind Let 's get right to the heart of this thing Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel
What
I did n't think so Because in spite of his race this man is extremely valuable to me Hell I forgot all about this beer You want one How about some ether
Hell no
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney He 's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip He 's a foreigner I think he 's probably Samoan But it does n't matter does it Are you prejudiced
Yeah Explaining my Position Some asshole wrote a poem about that once
Do n't take any guff from those swine Remember if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People
Why not But for Christ 's sake just do it fast
Ridiculous Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up You never saw me before Shit this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate You ready
No I ca n't get out They 'll crucify me I 'll have to take the blame
Never missed a plane yet
The airport is over there
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by burning the locals abusing the tourists terrifying the help The only chance now I felt was the possibility that we 'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it
What are you doing You were supposed to turn back there
Her eyes were turgid with fear but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level
How much is the lemon meringue pie
I was stupid with shock not knowing whether to run or start laughing
Two glasses of ice water with ice
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard
Yeh This foreign made crap is sucking our dollar balance dry
Fuck the car They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio
Inspector Rock will pay you In cash A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month
Alright Alice you 'll be contacted by Inspector Rock Arthur Rock He 'll be posing as a politician
Do you think you can handle it
I think we should put her on the payroll See what she comes up with
So do we lady
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY What happened What about the glands
Man I 'll try about anything but I 'd never touch a pineal gland
then you 'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back
Yes
grow claws bleeding warts
Right
Man your head would swell up like a watermelon you 'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours
Sure That 's a good idea One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia
Extract of pineal
Some of what
Why not We should get some of that Just eat a big handful and see what happens
I could already feel the stuff working on me the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine maybe I should take a swim I thought
I know but the guy did n't have any cash to pay me He 's one of these Satanism freaks He offered me human blood said it would take me higher than I 've ever been in my life I thought he was kidding so I told him I 'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on
Jesus what kind of monster client have you picked up this time There 's only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body
Never mind it 's absolutely pure
Where 'd you get this
I remember slumping on the bed his performance had given me a bad jolt For a moment I thought his mind had snapped that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies But the room was quiet again
I remember thinking Jesus what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid
Hi Lucy Yeah it 's me I got your message what Hell no I taught the bastard a lesson he 'll never forget what No not dead but he wo n't be bothering anybody for a while Yeah I left him out there I stomped him then pulled all his teeth out
Adrenochrome
You wo n't need much Just a little tiny taste that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer Adrenochrome
What is this
Relax Let me handle this You 'd make a piss-poor lawyer Room 1600 please As your attorney I advise you not to worry Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit
It 's gone too far
OK goddamnit Look I 'll call her I 'll get her off our backs You 're right She 's my problem
She really flipped over you The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself I guess she figures you won That phone message was n't for me was it
Me
No she 's looking for you
Lucy is looking for you
Good work They 'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that
They 'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs
Sometimes it 's easier to just rip out the backstraps
We keep it quiet It 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to talk about upstairs Not with the press around
Sure It 's all on the Q.T but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line
Hurry up with those drinks We 're thirsty Only two rums Make mine a Bloody Mary
What 's wrong with you Hell somebody has to do it
They were all veterans
Yeh naked except for the weapons
and every one of them stacked naked
Like big lizards
They just ran back out into Death Valley you know where Manson turned up
What could they do The guy that took the head was about six-seven and maybe three-hundred pounds He was packing two Lugers and the others had M-16s
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald 's hamburger stand She was a waitress about sixteen years old with a lot of people watching too
Hell in Malibu alone these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day All they want is the blood They 'll take people right off the street if they have to
Man you do n't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice
Read the newspapers
Right Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you 're partying with a thousand cops
This is a fucking nightmare
Do n't mention that word around here You 'll get them excited
Man I know these people in my goddamn blood
They 're actually nice people when you get to know them
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider but I did n't believe they were real Not like this Not hundreds of them
Right Let 's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon I feel a powerful lust for red salmon
Maybe we should take it easy tonight
As your attorney I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline
That 's good You ca n't be subtle in this town
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe Also I told him I 'd be there myself in an hour and if she was n't I 'd come back out here and rip his lungs out
I felt like a Nazi but it had to be done
Okay Lucy it 's time to go meet Barbra
Us
It just occurred to me that she has no witnesses Anything that she says about us is completely worthless
What What kind of goddamn monster are you
We have to cut her loose She 's got two hundred dollars And we can always call the cops up there in Montana where she lives and turn her in
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards But it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect My attorney
You 'll go straight to the gas chamber And even if you manage to beat that they 'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy She 's got to go
NO I felt sorry for the girl I wanted to help her
In a few hours she 'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing uncircumcised member
You filthy bastard I should cave your fucking head in
I figure she can do about four at a time Christ if we keep her full of acid that 's more like two grand a day Maybe three
NO Stop talking like that
It 's straight economics This girl is a god-send Shit she can make us a grand a day
Jesus Christ I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff
She 's perfect for this gig These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her We can set her up in one of these back street motels hang pictures of Jesus all over the room then turn these pigs loose on her Hell she 's strong she 'll hold her own
Listen she 's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months It 's terrible
Well It 'll probably work out We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention
Shit I met her on the plane and I had all that acid You know those little blue barrels I gave her a cap before I realized she 's a religious freak Jesus she 's never even had a drink
Lucy
Plans
WELL What are your plans
It ca n't be helped This is Lucy You know like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
You degenerate pig
You 're supposed to be in Vegas We have a suite at the Flamingo I was just about to leave for the airport
What Fuck telegrams I 'm in trouble You worthless bastard I 'll cripple your ass for this All that shit in the car is yours You understand that When I finish testifying out here you 'll be disbarred
What are you doing in Baker Did n't you get my telegram
You bastard I need a lawyer immediately
Who said anything about slicing you up I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead Nothing serious
There 's no choice I would n't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife
The cops
Why not Hell just a minute ago you were asking me to kill you And now you want to kill me What I should do goddamnit is call the police
You cheap honky sonofabitch
Why worry You 'll like it Nothing in the world like a Mace high Forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves
You bastard You 'd do that would n't you
Are you ready
Fuck yes I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it
Do it I want to get HIGHER
Jesus
BULLSHIT Do n't make me use this
Not me It would blast you through the wall stone dead in ten seconds and they 'd make me explain it
Back the tape up I need it again Let it roll Just as high as the fucker can go And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME
Do n't touch it Get back in that tub
I want that fucking radio
Whatever 's right
How about a check
Of course I 'm your attorney I 'll give you all the time you need at my normal rates 45 an hour but you 'll be wanting a cushion so why do n't you just lay one of those 100 bills down there beside the radio and fuck off
OK But do me one last favor will you Can you give me two hours That 's all I ask just two hours to sleep before tomorrow I suspect it 's going to be a very difficult day
I dig my own graves Green water and the White Rabbit Put it on
You 're doomed I 'm leaving here in two hours and then they 're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps Right there in that tub
Jefferson Airplane White Rabbit I want a rising sound
What tape
Music Turn it up Put that tape on
You evil son of a bitch You better hope there 's some Thorazine in that bag because if there 's not you 're in bad trouble
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight I have to put the car in the lot
Have you made a deal with him Did you put him on to her
They did n't have any They do n't grow in the desert
What limes
Room service sent it up I wanted something to cut the limes
Where 'd you get that knife
That 's right laugh about it You goddamn honkies are all the same
That little blonde groupie with the film crew You think he sodomized her
That dirty bastard I knew it He 's got hold of my woman
He told me he was turning in early
Do n't kid yourself That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous He 's watching us like a hawk
No we should leave the poor bastard alone I get the feeling that he 's avoiding us for some reason
Let 's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose
What for
Yeah I thought we might need it
You drive I think there 's something wrong with me
Do n't run They 'd like any excuse to shoot us
Do n't go near that elevator That 's just what they want us to do trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement
Good God Let 's get out of here Where 's the elevator
Probably the bartender He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress
Did you see that Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back
It wo n't stop It 's not ever going to stop
When does this thing stop
Do they pay you to screw that bear
OK Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly It 's going to be a long walk
I want to leave fast
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door
Can we make it
OK I 'll lend you some money Let 's go outside and see how much we have left
No This is serious One more hour in this town and I 'll kill somebody
Calm down You 'll be straight in a few hours
Yes Leave the country Tonight
GO
I have to go
Not much Why
Please do n't tell me those things Not now This is my last drink How much money can you lend me
Look over there Two women fucking a Polar Bear
That 's what gives me The Fear
Nonsense We came here to find the American Dream and now we 're right in the vortex you want to quit You must realize that we 've found the Main Nerve
I hate to say this but this place is getting to me I think I 'm getting The Fear
Get sheep over side women and children to armored car orders from Captain Zeep
Dogs fucked the Pope no fault of mine Watch out Why money My name is Brinks I was born Born
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think What 's happening here What 's going on Then you hear yourself mumbling
Where 's the ether This mescaline is n't working
This is the place They 'll never fuck with us here
We wandered into a fucking time capsule
Did the mescaline just kick in Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig
Jesus creeping shit
What do you expect I 'm your attorney You owe me five bucks I want it now
Holy shit They almost had us there That was quick thinking
Why what
Why
To do the job of course Here we go a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars
Look what are we doing here Are we here to entertain ourselves or to do the job
How about Nickel Nick 's Slot Arcade Hot Slots that sounds heavy Twenty nine cent hotdogs
Total control now Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible stoned ripped twisted Good people
They 'll probably have a big net for us when we show up
I think he 's lying to us I could see it in his eyes
That 's good
You bastard They 'll never let us back in that place I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around yelling about reptiles You scared the shit out of those people They were ready to call the cops Hell the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there
What are you talking about
Not yet I want to study its habits
Shoot it
No no Do n't leave me
That 's the press table Where you have to sign in for our credentials Shit let 's get it over with You handle that and I 'll check on the room
But what about our room And the golf shoes
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda I told him I knew what he was up to He says he 's a photographer But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked He knows we 're onto him
If you think we 're in trouble now wait until you see what 's happening in the elevators
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things It wo n't be long before they tear us to shreds
Lacerda
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side Who 's Lacerda he 's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor
Thirty minutes It was going to be very close
Maybe thirty more minutes As your attorney I advise you to drive at top speed It 'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal Are you ready for that Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid
How long do I have
You whore
You better be careful Plenty of vultures out here They 'll pick your bones clean before morning
God did n't do that You did it You 're a fucking narcotics agent that was our cocaine you pig
Oh Jesus Did you see what god just did to us
And eat them That bastard wo n't get away with this What 's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism
Savage Henry has cashed his check We 're going to rip his lungs out
The truth is we 're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry I 've known him for years but he ripped us off and you know what that means right
Pay no attention to this swine He ca n't handle the medicine
What the fuck are we doing out here Somebody call the police We need help
You scurvy shyster bastard Watch your language You 're talking to a Doctor of Journalism
Turn up the fucking music My heart feels like an alligator Volume Clarity Bass We must have bass What 's wrong with us Are you goddamn old ladies
The medicine Yes it 's right here
Where 's the medicine
My heart
He said he understood but I could see in his eyes that he did n't He was lying to me
My attorney understands this concept despite his racial handicap But do you
Damn right
and we 're chock full of that
We will You Samoans are all the same You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man 's culture
We wo n't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit
Do n't take any guff from these swine Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment Nothing dinky One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike for picking up conversations in oncoming cars
O.K O.K yes Hang onto it We 'll be there in thirty minutes I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring What OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card Do you realize who the fuck you 're talking to
Indeed We must do it What kind of story is this
I tell you my man This is the American Dream in action We 'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end
Why not If a thing 's worth doing it 's worth doing right
God hell I think I see the pattern This one sounds like real trouble You 're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over As your attorney I must advise you that you 'll need a very fast car with no top and after that the cocaine And then the tape recorder for special music and some Acapulco shirts This blows my weekend because naturally I 'll have to go with you and we 'll have to arm ourselves
It 's okay He 's admiring the shape of your skull
Or just think it Was I talking Did they hear me
Jesus Did I say that
If so well we 'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere Because it goes without saying that we ca n't turn him loose He 'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency and they 'll run us down like dogs
No more of that talk or I 'll put the leeches on you
We 're your friends We 're not like the others
One toke You poor fool Wait till you see those goddamn bats
One toke over the line sweet Jesus
I fear nothing
The password is One Hand Washes The Other The minute you hear that you say I fear nothing
Alice Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice
You 're damn right But the first time you say anything about this to anybody you 'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life What 's your name
You 'd pay me for that
No I swear I 'm not
Maybe she 's telling the truth Maybe she 's not part of it
I know you 're cops but I thought you were just here for that convention I swear All I wanted to do was clean up the room I do n't know anything about dope
The dope ring You must know what 's going on in this hotel Why do you think we 're here
Nobody I 'm the maid
What made you do it Who paid you off
YOU 'RE UNDER ARREST
Please please I 'm only the maid I did n't mean nothin
I 'll try I 've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time I 've heard a lot about it
PATROLMAN Not my jurisdiction The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area Can you make it that far
How far is Baker I was hoping to stop there for lunch
PATROLMAN Okay Here 's how it is What goes into my book as of noon is that I apprehended you for driving too fast and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area your stated destination right Where you plan to take a long nap Do I make myself clear
A nap wo n't help I 've been awake for too long three or four nights I ca n't even remember If I go to sleep now I 'm dead for twenty hours
PATROLMAN You know I get the feeling you could use a nap There 's a rest area up ahead Why do n't you pull over and sleep a few hours
PATROLMAN That 's a strange attitude
Yeah I know I 'm guilty I understand that I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway Shit why argue I 'm a fucking criminal
PATROLMAN You realize
Why not It was getting warm anyway
PATROLMAN Could I have that please
Of course officer
PATROLMAN May I see your license
Do n't worry it 's all over now Thank God for the decent people
Whatever you say gentlemen I ca n't tell you how sorry I am about what happened
Oh and do n't bother to make up the room That way we wo n't have to risk another of these little incidents will we
You and a lot of other people
Oh Lord I 'd do just about anything for that
One phone call every day Just tell us what you 've seen Do n't worry if it does n't add up that 's our problem
What
Yes I 'll help you all you need I hate dope
In that case maybe she can help
No No I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff
Come on baby do n't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman

That 's not the point Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you No No that young lady has a contract and she 's going to honor it
Well you could always dump her Mr Bebe Teach her a lesson There are a million beautiful girls out there who do n't give a damn about politics
I do n't know who she fucked to get where she is but I do n't think it was me
Excuse me sir
I 'm sure it was n't me it was n't me
And on top of her political activities now she 's got a lawyer She wants out of her contract Mr Bebe She says she 's through with motion pictures
Very fine bone structure
I guess so sir
Okay Good tits Ca n't we show them off a little more
Frances Farmer contract player six month option
Who 's this
Good morning Mr Bebe
I 'd like nothing better
Look Mr Bebe you can hold me to my contract but you ca n't break me I 'm back and I 'm gon na make the best of it
That 's right You 're an actress Miss Farmer and your job is to act
But I 'm the one up there on the screen
No I 'm concerned with everything
But I 'm concerned with everything Mr Bebe
Society is falling apart Miss Farmer and people have to buckle down do their jobs You see I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry and I ca n't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights now can I
Never mind that I 'm concerned about you Your attitude
Really That 's a very good book It 'd make a terrific
Since we have you on a seven year contract I 'm planning long-range I 'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called Come and Get It
I intend to make a great deal of money off you
Thank you
I like your looks You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties Garbo Dietrich
You see We 've got to change that name
That 's Frances I 'm not the cookbook
acts I 'll relay your message
I know 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs The writer writes the director directs and the actress
I 'm sorry Frances It 's my job you know
Yup Claire please please tell Mr Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life we 'd make a lot better movies
That 's not all Frances Mr Bebe is very concerned about your politics He hears you 've been donating money speaking at rallies
Uh-huh You mean what if the public finds out I perspire And wear slacks And drive an old jalopy What if they find out I 'm a real person Oh no Say it ai n't so Not a real person
You know what I mean
I do n't care if my clothes are taken seriously Or my car
Yes but Really I hate to sound it 's just that the public expects something different from its stars People wo n't take you seriously
It 's a perfectly good car It runs
Yeah I mean slacks and work clothes and that awful car
My clothes
Well I suppose I should just say it It 's your clothes
Sure Claire If you do n't mind walking my way
Hi Frances got a minute
Come here I want to show you something
Huh
Okay but come here first
Oh well I guess I better leave then
Oh my God Frances I 'm such a cad I ca n't go through with this My wife is in Europe but this is her house her bedroom I ca n't ask you to
Thank you
Madam
What
Good good Give them that
God damn it Clifford will you shut up I tell you I want to give these things I want to give them to the audience and I can give them I will give them so shut up
You do n't want to show your whole soul ugly mis-shapen and pitiful you do n't want to show it
I 'm not
You 're afraid
I 'm not
Face it Confess it You 're weak
He knows Frances
Does Clifford even know You did n't tell him did you I 'm gon na tell him Where is he
Right now we have to be practical
What does Clifford say
I know but
But but wait a minute We 're supposed to be different right Clifford says This theatre is supposed to be different And this play this play is all about what greed and money do to people
Yes That 's the deal She plays Lorna
A rich actress
An actress
Who
What Good Lord no it 's just It 's money We needed backing and well we found it
You do n't think I 'm good enough
Well well you see that 's the point You wo n't be opening in London
That 's right I do n't want them breathing down my neck while we 're in London
I hear you 're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract
What 's up
Oh
He 's not here
Where 's Clifford
Frances
Hello Harold
I 'm not afraid of struggle Clifford
Not only an artist but an instrument of change We must look to the world around us not content to observe but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy We contribute our profits for if fascism is not stopped in Spain it will spread across Europe jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive The artist to be vital must be a soldier too
Who is she
Forgive my indulgence Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy The point is Mr Odets here has written a wonderful play Most of the roles are cast but we have n't found our female lead
Really Mr Clurman you do n't have to sell me
The Group is more than a theatre company It 's the embodiment of an ideal Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense a creative individual and an instrument of change You see
You 're under arrest
GET OUT
Get your clothes on lady
You have no right You have no fucking right you bastards Get the hell out of here
Get your clothes on
I did n't make the law lady I just enforce it
Come on You 're seriously trying to tell me the Japs ca n't find Los Angeles without my headlights
Cool off beautiful Did n't you see the sign says Dimout Zone There 's a war on you know
In my eyes officer
Hey where 's the fire sister
You want his name
The premiere I never pressed you about it but god damn it you 're gon na tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were
What night
No It 's all about that night is n't it
No
I do n't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too that I might want to do theatre No 'cause you do n't want me along do you And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock
Dick
Dwayne I 'm Dwayne now And you damn well better get used to it
Dick I ca n't even breathe here
Hey I 'm not a complete fool you know I can see you 're going sour on me and when I try to do something about it you turn your back and say it 's nothing
Dick we need some time apart
You were n't going to tell me were you Just pack up and leave is that it
Showdown
Without me
Yes
There was another call too From your agent He says your summer stock deal is all set So you 're going back east huh
Yeah She said she delivered your message and that you 'd understand
Fired
Yeah Claire She said she was fired Too bad huh
Claire
Well about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called what 's her name
Who
There 've been some calls
Sort of
You learn your lines
Good 'Cause I do n't want to see you again
All square Doc
We 're all square now Harry Right
I got ta go now
Harry
Frances we got ta do it this way Just remember tomorrow remember what I told you What 're you gon na tell 'em
Let 's get out of here I 'll lose my job
I 'm taking care of that Harry Just hold her Reserpine I guarantee you this 'll clear her head She 'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing
Look at her She 'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow
The hearing 's tomorrow If she gets out legally they ca n't come after her
Oh God Let 's get her out of here tonight right now Let 's take her with us
Thank you Harry
We 'll get you home Frances
Harry Oh Harry I knew you 'd come I love you Harry I love Take me home Harry
One question If I 'm not myself now just who do you think I am
We 'll talk more about this I 'll see you later
I see
Be patient that 's all Take an interest in your treatment and do n't dwell on your resentments You 'll be yourself again I assure you
You I 'm sorry forgive me Doctor tell me honestly what do I have to do to get out of here
Listen to yourself Frances The resistance the anger in your voice
No Cut this runaround Doctor I know better
I 'm afraid not You see we observe things that you 're unaware of signs indicators Your problem cuts very deep Frances and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out you 'll really feel secure Does that make sense
Do n't you
I know you believe that
Doctor it may sound odd but I believe I 've profited from my stay here It 's just what I 've needed to get away like this But I 'm recuperated now I 've had lots of time to think and I 've made a few decisions about my life I 'm ready to get on with it
Thank you
TEACHER New York Frances Broadway This is your chance You belong on the stage
Really
TEACHER Yes yes it 's all arranged Everyone 's collecting subscriptions in your name And the best part is the trip returns you to New York
But I 'll never win that
TEACHER This is the answer a subscription drive to Voice of Action First prize is a trip to Moscow You could visit the art theatre maybe even meet Stanislavski
Thank you Frances And after the show we 're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood 's own Roosevelt Hotel
Thank you Ralph
No Never
Were you a drug addict
No
Were you an alcoholic
No Ralph I do n't believe I ever was sick But when you 're treated like a patient long enough you 're apt to act like one
until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution Were you mentally ill Frances
I pity us Dad I pity us both
Are you are you hungry
Daddy
Please Francie
You know where you 're taking me You know what she 'll do Just give me a minute slow down give me an instant for once in your life please
But I gave her my word Besides she 's still your legal guardian My hands are tied
Dad here You do n't have to stop just slow down You can tell Mama I jumped out She knows that 's the kind of thing I 'd do She wo n't blame you
They 'll just catch you again Francie Besides your mother will know
Why It 's such a simple thing You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again
Francie you know I ca n't do that
I love you too Francie
I do n't care Dad I love you
I 'm sorry I I do n't have a desk in my room and
Always Always
Dad whatever I decide will it be okay with you
Well Francie sometimes after you get your hands on something you want it just does n't look the same Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it 's all you 've got or just let it go This is the way of things but I guess you already know that
But Dad I 'm asking about me What do you think I should do
What you have to understand Francie is that she well she wanted so much for herself too and for me and she never really got to The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers but she could have been if times were different she could have been a politician or I do n't know
I know that Dad but
I do n't know honey Your mother has such big plans for you
So what do you think
Be careful Francie
I love you Mama I love you Dad
Then go
If I did n't I would n't put you through it
And you think it 's worth all this
Of course
You really want to go
What do I do Dad
Francie you 'll learn that sometimes it 's best to stay low and just walk away
Dad please do n't leave early Just because of Mama
And I ca n't understand how it can hurt to be honest but the more I tried to explain
I know
It 's already started Dad with me
He 's a socialist then
No no no All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation
Is Kaminski a Communist
Yeah well it 's possible Harry York and I both work for Mr Kaminski right now and well There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break That 's the way of things but Mr Kaminski wants to change it and when it comes to new ideas the people in power get nervous
He talked to me today Told me to keep my mouth shut or I 'd get everybody in trouble
Well Harry York is a guy who well he does a lot of things Why do you ask
Yeah I suppose Dad who 's Harry York
You wrote it did n't you
I did n't have much to do with it
An essay contest a national contest That 's pretty impressive
Thanks Dad
I 'm I 'm really proud of you Frances
See you next weekend Dad
Bye baby
That 's a thought Lil That sure is a thought
Do n't make me sick I 'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound
Lillian I 'm more than willing to meet you halfway
As usual Everything as usual Mr Farmer Just give me my due
See you next weekend
Good
I 'm going back to the hotel
That 's right I ca n't understand a man who puts strangers over his family a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure
No Lil It 's just you ca n't understand their brand of patriotism
How What do they do for you Kaminski and his friends They 're all anarchists Traitors
They need help Lil They pay me back in other ways
You 've sacrificed If you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents
I have a right to talk to her She 's my daughter and she 's beginning to understand why I 've sacrificed so much in order to achieve
You 're poisoning that child 's mind
When 's the last time you saw a hundred dollars Ernest Farmer
Thank you
Bread
I can thank you for that It was a hard-earned talent
It always amazes me Lil how you can whip up a hot hearty meal out of thin air

Whattaya think you 're in now
I do n't think I 'd be much good in a war
Take advantage of me
That 's right
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone
What
I should 've known
Couple hours from Idaho We 'll cut across to Montana I 've got friends there with a ranch
Where are we mean man

Evening gorgeous
You 've looked a whole lot better C'mon
Oh my God I look awful
Who said I was a lady
Take a walk pal
Well to get a crack at something good you got ta earn it you got ta climb the ladder first So you do you work hard and all these people behind you are pushing you up shouting you on And then one day you realize you are you 're at the top and there 's nothing there And you look behind you and there 's no one below You 're just left there all alone swaying in the god-damned breeze
And
I just wanted to be part of something one thing one play or one movie something that was really fine memorable And I could say I did that I made something good
You 're coming
No Harry I ca n't
Hey look I got some business down in San Diego Whattaya say you come with me stay a few days
Beats me
Yeah and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are what 's going on inside their heads Sometimes you can hear it like a buzzing the things that happen in their heads And you wonder does anybody ever love anybody really
So you drink and you fight with a cop
I do n't know It hurts Harry Some things no matter what you do with them they just hurt
I 'll bet
I took the early rounds
Six months probation You got ta learn when to do battle Farmer You 're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops
Well I would have you know I just did n't know how to cook it
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter

Some people starve kid Until we can do something about it they might as well see a movie Makes 'em feel better
I do n't have what they want Harry Harry will you tell me something How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving
Frances you 're a movie star now If you give them what they want you can get anything

If they say they love it they 'll probably love it Not everybody lies you know
You know the funny thing is it 's not a great movie I mean it could 've been but they screwed it up gave it a happy ending And all my friends I know they 're going to smile and say they loved it
Forget it

Pretty morning
You are a deeply troubled young lady I only hope you change your course before it 's too late
Fine
Miss Farmer In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail
Miss Farmer you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen
Sure it 's true I was fighting for my country as well as myself
Miss Farmer is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night
That 's fine with me Get it Fine A fine Hey c'mon c'mon what is this an audience or a jury
You 're on your way to a contempt citation young lady

Thank you for understanding Mama

Have n't you heard what I said
They want you back Your agent called today Do n't you understand He 's sending the scripts He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people Frances you ca n't do this to your fans Why they 've been praying for you all through this nightmare You ca n't turn your back on them now Look at this fan mail I 've been answering
Mama

Not long
How long will you be
For a walk Mama Just a walk
Where are you going
Nothing I think I 'll just go out for awhile
What 's wrong
I think I need a little air
Please I want you to It would make me so happy
Oh Mama I 'm so tired of that song
Frances you remember my lawyer Alma Styles
Well who have we here
Go on
What
You kill me Mama
It 's your fan mail little sister
Then why did you bring them
Well they needed immediate answers Frances It 's good manners and good sense You should n't be bothering yourself with these right now
Why are these all opened
And here 's one from nice Mr Zeiss He says that
Are you crazy Unhand that woman That 's Amelia Earhart
Tell them who I am Tell them who I am
You 're taking me home
Shhh shhh You 're not going to jail Frances The Judge has put you under my care I 'll see you get the rest you need
Mama what 's
It 's alright now little sister everything 's going to be just fine
Smile little sister smile
It 's okay
You will
I do n't care
Yes but important people are concerned about this Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles
It is n't in your hands Mama It 's my life
Oh Mama do n't you understand
I 'll pay your way to New York I 'll work I 'll slave I 'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers or
Oh Ma they 're not using me It 's just a chance to travel see things Besides it 's the only way I can get to New York
But they 're using you
And you should be proud You won that contest and made a name for yourself
Yes Ma
Do n't listen to him little sister When you 're proud of what you are you do n't refuse the label understand
I 'm not hungry You two just enjoy yourselves After all this is a celebration
Mama
Oh bullshit
HILLIER 'S WIFE No my dear You must be mistaken
Sure You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay
HILLIER 'S WIFE I do n't believe so
Do n't I know you
HILLIER 'S WIFE Yes
Excuse me
HILLIER 'S WIFE On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club as a token of our vast admiration
Sedate her
Symington says
No I 'm warning you Who do you think you are God You bumble around with your folders and your pencils and your god-damn buttons all your badges of authority But you have no authority You 're nothing You 're a zero
Frances I 'm warning you
I want outta here you understand I 'm ready to get out So you go back there you go back and you tell them to let me out
'Cause if it 's long enough which I doubt why do n't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass
Huh
Dr Symington how big is your dick
I 'm sure you 'll see it my way in the end
Mental illness is an elusive thing and though I 'm pleased you 're feeling more capable it 's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time Do n't you agree
You what
Frances you 're still filled with anxiety You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends Consequently I did n't recommend your release at the staff review
Doctor I hate to break this to you but my mother is a little batty
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative Whom do you think I should believe
I 'm sorry She misunderstood that 's all
Oh for Christ 's
And you accused her of tampering with your mail
I never said Oh look That 's just a figure of speech She said something funny and I said
She told me you said Mama you want to kill me
What
Do you really believe your mother 's trying to kill you
No What I mean is I 'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life that 's all
You 're telling me you feel guilty
Not at all She brought me my fan mail I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me But I guess that 's the best thing about working in the movies You make so many friends I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me was n't a mistake
Really Any problems
Yes It was very good to see her
I 'm sorry to keep you waiting the staff review ran over Did you enjoy your mother 's visit
You did n't say 'Symington says
Is there something else
Oh that 's good very professional In control But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away
I 'll have someone show you to your room
No you stay calm Doctor But you 're finding that difficult are n't you Why are you attracted to me Perhaps later in some of our more intimate sessions after we know each other a little better and you 've torn my personality to shreds and I 'm weeping and vulnerable then you 'll really get your kicks wo n't you Doctor
Stay calm please
This whole thing is a joke
Just a little joke Miss Farmer
Did you really say that
All right Will you please sit down now Symington says
Normal Average
And what 's that
Besides I do n't want to be what you want to make me
I see
You may discuss my predicament Doctor You may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me I 'm not interested I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian
Please sit down
Do you expect me for one moment to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do
Among persons such as yourself creative people under great stress erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of It 's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which
Oh Are you really
Why Doctor We 've only just met
So it seems May we be serious for a moment
It ai n't for lack of trying
I 'm glad to see you have n't lost your sense of humor
Aw shucks ma'am T'were n't nothin
Thanks are hardly necessary
Am I supposed to say 'thank you
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance
Good Because Brothers that 's you
CROWD No No
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country
CROWD No
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future and the future of your children
CROWD No
And do you think it 's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family
NURSE 'Incurable
NURSE What
NURSE Yeah well you know doctors They sure hate to use that word
NURSE You 're kidding
NURSE I checked the files This one holds the record for shock treatments Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight
NURSE Yeah
NURSE I do n't know why they even bother She 's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant
Build for him a pyre Light up the sky with his passing
What kindness
I 've never been shown a kindness Show me one now
Would you not He was father And mother We fell from grace together He from his God I from mine
Then why weep for him
And he drove me to mine
You drove him to his torment
I am as he made me In his own image
What is that to you Evil as you are
I longed to be with him But I wanted his final moments to have peace I could see you were a friend to him
I was watching
Yes
You were with him at the end
I am afraid
People can be kinder than you think
I have been afraid Afraid they will hate me because I am so very ugly and they are so very beautiful
Why do you not go to them
Yes Very close
Friends Do they live around here
Yes I have been seeking my friends
You 're an outcast
Worse
It ca n't be as bad as that
I 'm very very ugly People are afraid Except you
Why
Better that way for me
I 'm glad you finally came to the door A man should n't have to scurry in the shadows
The music Or the fire
Nice
SHE 'LL NEVER BE YOURS SHE SAID MY NAME SHE REMEMBERS
GET AWAY FROM HER SHE 'S MINE
I 'm sure the lady knows her own mind Does n't she Let her decide the proper suitor
She 's not for you
She 's beautiful
That is mild compared to what will come If you deny me my wedding night I 'll be with you on yours
I will not Kill me now
You will honor your promise to me
No I draw the line
What does it matter She 'll live again You 'll make her
This was not taken from a grave
A brain Extremities
What is this
Her body pleases me
Why her
I 'll be waiting And watching
Yes I want this over and done with
Soon
We 'd travel north my bride and I To the furthest reaches of the Pole where no man has ever set foot There we would live out our lives Together No human eye would ever see us again This I vow
And if I consent
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being I would make peace with all I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine And rage the likes of which you would not believe If I can not satisfy the one I will demonically indulge the other That choice is yours You 're the one who set this in motion Frankenstein
Like you Oh God you do n't know what you 're asking
A companion A female Like me so she wo n't hate me
Friend
There is something I want A friend
What can I do
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all
I do n't know
Stolen memories Stolen and hazy They taunt me in my dreams I 've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her Whose woman was this I 've seen boys playing splashing about in a stream Whose childhood friends were these Who am I
Trace memories in the brain perhaps
In which part of me did this knowledge reside In these hands In this mind In this heart And reading and speaking Not things learned so much as things remembered
You 're wrong Do you know I knew how to play this
Materials Nothing more
What of my soul Do I have one Or was that a part you left out Who were these people of which I am comprised Good people Bad people
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand
Why Victor Why What were you thinking
I 'm not sure I believe But then I had no one to instruct me I had no mother and my father abandoned me at birth
I see it before me
Evil Do you believe in evil
How dare you You 're disgusting and evil
Your crime as well as mine
Fine words from a child killer You who murdered my brother
More to the point why am I here What did you want with me What does one say to one 's Maker having finally met him face to face Milton gave it voice Did I request thee Maker from my clay to mould me Man Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me
Then why am I here What did you want with me
Kill you Hardly that
Kill me and have done with it
The letters in your journal That and a geography book Your Elizabeth sounds lovely
How did you find me
Yes I speak And read And think and know the ways of Man I 've been waiting for you Two months now
You speak
Come warm yourself if you like
Fine
Are you all right
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it We 'll say it came today It 'll set his mind at ease
And not a word of them to Father He 's agitated enough not hearing from Victor
Elizabeth If it 's true travel into Germany would be banned You 'd never get near Ingolstadt Besides they 're only rumors
I should go I should leave today
So have I
Something 's wrong I know it I 've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg
It 's been months It 's not like him
Nothing Still nothing
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a pompous Fellow
Must 've been a terrible row
And you look so lovely
You dance so beautifully together
One-two-three one-two-three twirl two-three
Scandalous What would your dear mother say
Elizabeth really He 's quite mad
Quite right
That 's the nature of all progress William Do n't let your brother sway you otherwise
There there shhh
Poor William What indignant tears
It 's far too late for him to still be out
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time They say he never arrived
Is he not back yet
Have you seen Willie
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left He 's coming home to marry me
What does it say
He set things right with a proper apology and now they 've put him in charge of dissection lab
He always was opinionated
Open this door for no-one
Victor
I have been waiting for this ever since
I remember the first time I ever saw you Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side So beautiful even then
Now husband and wife
Brother and sister no more
I do But you must trust me for now
Victor tell me why Trust me
Yes We 're in danger here Every moment we stay
Does this have something to do with that man you saw
We 'll leave this afternoon right after the ceremony Pack only what you need
It is
It was misguided and pointless Is your answer yes
Why the change What about your work
No Not tomorrow not next week Marry me today
A month at most that 's all I ask Elizabeth please Things have not yet resolved I must take steps to see that they do For our family 's sake For our sake You are life itself We shall seal our vow The moment I am done
We need each other now I need your comfort and strength not separation and solitude
So do I
What of our marriage Victor we 've had so much tragedy I want this family to live again
It 's not something I can explain now Perhaps someday
What sort of task
I 'm all right I 'm safe
I thought I 'd never see you again
I know only that he is a killer And I shall bring back his carcass
Do you know this man Is there something between you
They 've done a fine job Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend
If what you say is true it is a matter for the police
I 've no choice
But why risk yourself Has n't this family suffered enough
My mind was not playing tricks He was there in the storm gloating over his crimes challenging me to come
Elizabeth My more than sister
Victor I love you
until our wedding night When our bodies will join
I give you my soul
Your decision For us
Our decision Together
Not as weak as I
You make me weak
I will be here when you return
Only you
If only I could But one of us must stay Father 's not strong Willie 's just a child Who can look after them in your absence Who can run the estate
Then come with me to Ingolstadt Marry me now
I wish to be your wife
I wish to be your husband
Brother and sister still
Is that what makes it so delicious
This feels incestuous
All my life I 've known
I 've loved you all my life
To be the best there ever was To push our knowledge beyond our dreams to eradicate disease and pestilence to purge mankind of ignorance and fear
You will What do you want Victor
I 'll have to do better than that
Prouder still You 'll be the handsomest student there
And you
Father 's so proud
Quite a send-off is n't it
Smell the air Wonderful
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel
Do n't listen Willie Progress is a feast to be consumed Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run Or run before you can waltz
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies Make yourself heard Willie Learning to walk is not an easy thing Why should it be so
Oh do give him here He needs to be comforted and held
The world is a dizzying place
Victor have a care You 'll make him dizzy
He left a beautiful gift in her place A baby boy To cherish and love as our very own Your brother
God took her from us
She was mother to me as well But ours is the job of the living It 's up to us now to hold this family together We must think of Father and be strong for him I can not do that alone
What kind of God is He to will this
It 's not ours to decide All that live must die It 's God 's will
How could all my father 's knowledge and skill fail to save her
Nothing can Not ever
Are you sure it ca n't hurt us
Are n't you
Do n't cry Elizabeth
Aye Captain
He died Raving about phantoms He was mad poor devil Gather a detail Have the body removed from my cabin
This ice will break yet How 's our guest
A warming wind
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny
They knew the risks when they signed on I 've come too far to turn back now
Captain I implore you The men are frightened and angry They want your assurance
It would n't dare
It 's going to ram us
Oh God
Professor
Thank goodness We 'd be out of work
No But someday
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes
I 'm convinced Not by treating symptoms but by diving nature 's most jealously-guarded secrets
You 're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated
I 'm quite serious Look at all the charity and clinic work we do Up until thirty years ago the concept of vaccine was unheard of
Let it go
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave By my hand
I owe you that Done
Only if you 'll tell me who he is
I 'll be back as soon as I 've got her far away and safe We 'll hunt this fiend down together
Yes do n't worry I 'll look after your father You look after her
Are you sure you 'll be all right
I did n't find what I was looking for
What happened up there
This My home My family If not for you I 'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere
For what
Thank you Henry
Quite a place
Victor This place looked like a charnel house What went on here
No They do n't
It 's the down-and-outs I pity most Those who ca n't fend for themselves They 'll be dead by the thousands before this is done They do n't stand a chance out there
Nothing in moderation Frankenstein
Everything in moderation Clerval
We catch a few hours sleep where we can Usually here at your bedside
You 've been going round-the-clock
Mine and Professor Krempe 's We 've been trading off nursing you in shifts The rest of the time we 're out working with the cholera victims It 's his turn for that just now
Is that your diagnosis
We feared cholera Turned out to be pneumonia brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm
A week
Thank God your fever broke Slowly now Just a sip I 've been worried we might lose you It 's been touch-and-go for a week
You 'll be leaving then Just as well You never were cut out for this Henry Goodbye
Listen to what I 'm saying The militia 's arriving to quarantine the city Most of us are getting out while we still can
Yes And
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak Thousand new cases a day now Classes have been suspended University 's shut down
This is a bad time Henry I 'm busy just now What do you want
Few months perhaps I 'm gathering the raw materials even now
How much longer
That is my concern I 'm involved in something just now I want to finish it in Waldman 's memory
We all know how hard you took Waldman 's death Even Krempe is sympathetic But it is time to move on It is time to concern yourself with life
I 've been preoccupied
Victor This has got to stop Nobody 's seen you in months You have n't attended a single class
There are sick people who need our help Here and now Not in some future time Consider that
No He had more important work
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor
Blasphemy be damned Waldman spent his life trying to help people
That 's blasphemy
I resent God 's monopoly
You ca n't Death is God 's will
Why Waldman He of all people should have cheated death
You 're making a scene
It was wrong Henry It should n't have happened The bastard deserves to die
Keep your voice down You do n't know what you 're saying
Good I 'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap
They 'll hang him all the same
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance
They just caught the man who did it
Nothing in moderation Clerval
And here 's to Him Everything in moderation Frankenstein
Somebody has to
Only you would think of that
But you have n't listened Never in history has so much seemed possible We 're on the verge of answers undreamt of but only if we have the courage to ask the questions
yes and thanks to him smallpox has been virtually eliminated I 've heard this speech before
These are exciting times Henry We 're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs Look at Edward Jenner He was n't content to bleed people with leeches he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Now you 've got him started
It 's a letter to my father
What now Writing about it in your journal wo n't help
You 're a comfort to me Henry
The entire school heard it It was n't something one could miss
Do me a favor then keep them to yourself
Quite a few
Can you think of a better reason
Rich old ladies and their daughters
Come now Magnus Agrippa Next thing you know you 'll be teaching toadstools to speak
Do you really think I 'm mad
I know You have a way of making an impression
Victor Victor Frankenstein
Henry Clerval
Of course I am It pays to humor the insane
Are you having me on
As a march hare
I am not mad
Very well then
I was just clearing my throat
I have no knowledge of that
So you have claimed Yet you have no explanation for this The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder The locket you so coveted How did it come to be in your possession
Murder Willie In my heart he was our child Victor 's and mine Such a thing could never have entered my mind
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion
I have always loved him
And is it true Miss Moritz that you love Victor Frankenstein That your heart was broken Answer the question Do you love Victor Frankenstein
Yes I took refuge in the barn Would n't you Lost in the storm Freezing and wet I was exhausted and could search no longer
Despite the lack of challenge
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum
Of Geneva Tell me Mr Frankenstein of Geneva Do you wish to study medicine Or mysticism
Victor Frankenstein sir Of geneva
What is your name
Or Albertus Magnus Cornelius Agrippa
Paracelsus
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect Paracelsus for one
Philosophical
But surely Professor you do n't intend we disregard the more philosophical works
In science the letter of fact is the letter of law Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect Someday you may be priests but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse Any questions
Oh now you have gone too far There 's only one God Victor
I tell you what we need my friends Forget the symptoms and diseases What we need is a vaccine for death itself
The strain was evident
Victor He was trying to be gracious
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system
Re-configure the leads
Our profession needs talent like yours Destroy your career over an issue of pride What a waste
Why
a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty
Nonsense Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe
I doubt that decision is still mine to make
It is a thrilling direction to explore Thrilling and dangerous Nature can be wonderful and terrible Science is not a realm for the reckless it needs a conscience We must proceed cautiously Assess as we go What I do on my own time is my own business The same holds true for you You wish to expand your mind Fine do so You can even join me here if you like But not at the expense of your normal studies
But the possibilities Combining ancient knowledge with new Something like this could change our fundamental views
Why God alone knows what it means Until it has proven value it 's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick Hardly fit for the classroom
It 's utterly fantastic This is the sort of thing I 'm talking about We should be learning this
Electricity
I once saw it done as a boy in Canton My parents were missionaries The cure was nothing short of miraculous I 've never forgotten it Been fascinated ever since
Preposterous
No I embrace it as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known
You disdain accepted wisdom
To say the least I came here to expand my mind but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new
You have a way of provoking his I 've been watching you You seem impatient with your studies
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper
Victor explain yourself
Professor Waldman
My name is Frankenstein
Who are you
We are kindred you and I Men of ambition Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man
Madness
Do you share my madness
Lives are ephemeral The knowledge we gain the achievements we leave behind those live on
You 'd persist at the cost of your own life The lives of your crew
Then explain it whatever it is It could save the voyage I 've spent years planning this My entire fortune
Your men are right to be afraid
You know of it
Creature A human like creature
I ca n't say I blame them We 're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of creature
I heard
Would-be I 'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment
Ah An explorer
There 's a startling question coming from you I 'm captain of this ship We sailed from Archangel a month ago seeking a passage to the North Pole
How is it you come to be here
Are you a physician
Frostbite Gangrene A simple diagnosis
I 'm dying
You 're awake I 've prepared some broth It 'll help restore you
Maybe we should wait for Mr Christy
VOORHEES We should go now
VOORHEES I will protect you
The killer is still out there
Bill Bill Bill is out there
VOORHEES So young so pretty What monster could have done such a thing
No no they 're all dead

Jack and Marcie are gon na be drenched
Bad bulb or no power It 's getting a little gloomy in here
Trouble
Slipped in Probably liked the scent of your perfume

You can only do what you can do
Almost five
I did n't know I was asleep What time is it

What 'll you do when you leave here
I walked into it knowing I 'd get hurt but I thought I could stand anything I just was n't ready for that kind of pain We were supposed to meet in L.A When I got back there he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife
It still hurts
Artist
Filmmaker
You 're right It makes no sense

Did anyone ever tell you you 're beautiful when you 're angry
God but I love that macho talk Emergency generators The Indian used campfires
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty
Wait wait When I was finding these goodies in the shed I also found this letter which a camper never sent home Listen

Coach athletic director somewhere
Jack

Oh Seth how can I ever make it up to you
Did they look like psychos They were fuckin vampires Psychos do n't explode when sunlight hits 'em I do n't care how crazy they are
I 'm sorry to hear that What were they psychos
Well because you picked that place out of a hat my brother 's dead now And this girl 's family 's dead
No but I passed by it a couple of times It 's out in the middle of nowhere It seems like a rowdy place so there would n't be a lot of police And it 's open from dusk till dawn You said meet you in the morning
Have you ever been there before
I do n't know one place 's as good as another
Why the fuck outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico did you have us rendezvous at that place
Whatsamatter with you Are you crazy
To keep the daylight out This is where they sleep Get to the door
Why did they block the door again
Thank you son
Okay I 'll kill you when you change I swear to God in Jesus Christ 's name
It 's not suicide if you 're already dead Two
You do n't believe in suicide
I 'm running the show I make the plays and you back the plays I make Stop thinking with your fucking balls Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ai n't the time to go for it I need your cover Cover my ass
He 's running the show
Now you listen to me You ai n't gon na do a goddamn fucking thing you hear me Nobody cares what you think I 'm running this show I make the decisions
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin killers I ca n't do that If you do n't tell the cops I will
Son I have this situation under control I know exactly what I 'm doing You 're going to have to trust me on this
They 're gon na kill her anyway At least now with all these cops we 've got a fighting chance
What about Kate
Dad I watch those reality shows They never let anybody go Any cop will tell you in a situation like this you get a chance you go for it This is our chance
If they get over the border they 're gon na let us go
They 're gon na kill us They get us across the border they 're gon na take us out in the desert and shoot us
Have you forgotten about your sister
No dad you got ta tell 'em that they 're back there
I 'm gon na try and get us across the border
What are you gon na do
I have no idea
What 's this guy 's problem
Lie in the back Dad I 'll drive us into Mexico
I 'm exhausted
Why do you want to stop
The truth hurts
Unless you two wiseacres wan na be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking what say we drop this
Stop We 're not going to actually stop at a motel are we
We got about two more hours of day light left That 'll get us into El Paso which is right next to the border We 'll stop at a motel
Kate Scott
I promise
Amen
I do n't give a shit about living or dying anymore I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can
Well I say lets tear this place apart for weapons So when they burst through that door we 'll make 'em wish they never did
My guess is that this little dive 's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks
What 's this stuff
You bet your sweet ass you are and I 'm gon na help you do it But we ai n't got much time
You all are gon na fuckin die I 'm gon na fuckin kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit
Yep
Did he
Okay I 'll buy that So we got crosses covered moving right along what else
What 's an official cross Some piece of tin made in Taiwan What makes that official If a cross works against vampires it 's not the cross itself it 's what the cross represents The cross is a symbol of holiness
I do n't know about that In order for it to have any power I think it 's got ta be an official crucifix
In other words no
In the Winnebago
Good for you Now since we all believe we 're dealing with vampires what do we know about vampires Crosses hurt vampires Do you have a cross
I 'm like you I do n't believe in vampires but I believe in what I saw
You too preacher
Yeah I know what 's going on We got a bunch of fuckin vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin blood That 's it plain and simple And I do n't wan na hear any bullshit about I do n't believe in vampires because I do n't fuckin believe in vampires either But I do believe in my own two fuckin eyes and with my two eyes I saw fuckin vampires Now does everybody agree we 're dealin with vampires
Okay does anybody here know what 's going on
Forever together
Now is your shit together
To yours
To your family
Nothing I did n't make a statement I asked a question Would you like me to ask it again Very well Are you such a loser you ca n't tell when you 've won The entire state of Texas along with the FBI is looking for you Did they find you No They could n't They had every entrance to the border covered There 's no way you could get across Did you Yes you did You 've won Seth enjoy it
What did you call me
Are you so much a fucking loser you ca n't tell when you 've won
I never said do what I do I said do what I say
Before we stepped in here you told all of us to be cool That means you too
I 'm gon na just sit here and drain this bottle And when I 've drunk the last drop if I still feel then the way I feel now I 'm gon na take this bottle and break it over his melon head
What are you going to do
He 's smilin at us But behind his smile he 's sayin Fuck you Jack I hear that loud and clear
He backed down
I 'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me And that fuckin bartender sticks a weed up my ass too
Why are you so agitated
Suit yourself more for me Scotty
No I do drink I 'm just not drinking now
Why not against your religion
Pass
Who else
Shit I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin 4-H club
Out of the stew pot and into the fire
Then stop 'cause that 's where we 're going
Then
Pops when you 're right you 're right and you are right
We did our part we gotcha in Mexico Now it 's time for your part letting us go
Well you just keep thinkin of that gun next to Kate 's temple
I do n't have the slightest idea
As long as you 're cool she 'll be cool What 're ya gon na say
I 'm telling you do n't hurt her
You best better get it done Pops
I swear to God I wo n't try to escape and I 'll do my best to get you into Mexico
Swear to God on the Bible you wo n't try to escape and you 'll get us across the border
Fair enough You break your word I 'll kill all of you Kate honey
If he touches her I 'll kill him I do n't give a fuck how many guns you have nothing will stop me from killing him
I can handle Richie do n't worry
You wo n't let him touch her
Did n't think so So as I was saying I 'm willing to make a deal You behave get us into Mexico and do n't try to escape I 'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning
No I did n't
Did n't like it did ya
Yes
Look dickhead the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you 're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters I do n't wan na hafta worry about you all fuckin night And I do n't think you wan na be worrying about my brother 's intentions toward your daughter all night You notice the way he looked at her did n't ya
You want me to sit here and be passive The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you 'll let us go I 'm not there yet You have to convince me you 're telling the truth
Jesus Christ Pops do n't start with this shit
How do I know you 'll keep your word
I thought so You help us get across the border without incident stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny and in the morning we 'll let you and your family go That way everybody gets what they want You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico Everybody 's happy
Yes
I seem to have touched a nerve Do n't be so sensitive Pops let 's keep this friendly But you 're right enough with the getting to know you shit Now there 's two ways we can play this hand One way is me and you go round an round all fuckin night The other way is we reach some sort of an understanding Now if we go down that first path at the end of the day I 'll win But we go down the second we 'll both win Now I do n't give a rat 's ass about you or your fuckin family Y'all can live forever or die this second and I do n't care which The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back and our money And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico Now stop me if I 'm wrong but I take it you do n't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice or the bank getting its money back Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter your son and possibly yourself Am I correct
I think I 've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I 'm gon na get Now if you need me like I think you need me you 're not gon na kill me 'cause I wo n't answer your stupid prying questions So with all due respect mind your own business
Why 'd ya quit
Yes
Was As in not anymore
I was a minister
You 're a preacher
Real McCoy
I 've seen one of these before A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion Away to fuck the IRS Is that what you 're doing or are you the real McCoy
Yes
Is this real
Yes they do
Whewww Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off do n't they

Scott

You 're gon na be okay are n't you daddy
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door
About two hours from now
Other places have beds they also have cable TV a gym room service
It has a bed That 's all I care about
If it does n't have a pool we 're looking for a new place
It 's not a flop house It 's basic and simple That does n't make it a flop house
It 's a flop house
There 's nothing wrong with this place
Mom 's got nothing to say she 's dead
What do you think Mom would say
Kate give your old man a little credit Every person who chooses the service of God as their life 's work has something in common I do n't care if you 're a preacher a priest a nun a rabbi or a Buddhist monk Many many times during your life you 'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself am I a fool We 've all done it I 'm not going through a lapse What I 've experienced is closer to awakening I 'm not trying to shake your faith I 've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore
That happens you 'll get it back
I did n't say fuck him I 'm just not connected anymore
It 's just all our lives you 've been a pastor For twenty years you 've preached trust in the lord And then one day you wake up and say fuck him
Not enough to be a pastor Look I know this is hard on you kids After Jenny 's death this is probably the last thing you need But I ca n't do it any longer My congregation needs spiritual leadership Well they ca n't get that from me anymore My faith is gone To answer your question yes I do believe in Jesus But do I love them No After Jenny died I just thought what 's the point
I did n't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset But you do n't believe in God anymore
That 's very nice of Ted but I 'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting
Dad when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist Mr Franklin said he would n't permanently replace you until we came back He said when we come home if you still feel the same way
Hey if we go to a motel we can swim
I just bet you would Do n't even think about it Besides I want to have one night 's sleep in an honest to-goodness bed The beds in the home are okay but they 're not like a real bed
Ai n't it the truth
You two ought to start a stand-up act because you 're just wasting your humor on me
It 's the bitterest of pills
You asked me if I would
What did I say
What you said to me in the room
Do what
In the room Were you serious or were you just foolin around I 'm just bringing it up 'cause if you really want me to do that for you I will
What
Mexicans
What 's in Mexico

We 're having a wet bikini contest and you just won
What 's going on
Later

Not many
How many bullets left kid
Anytime
Watch my back
Noooo
Daddy 's dead
We have to go back for Daddy
Bullshit You hate us If you had half a chance you 'd feed us to them
I 'm really sorry
Peachy Why should n't I be The world 's my oyster except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother 's heart because he turned into a vampire even though I do n't believe in vampires Aside from that unfortunate business everything 's hunky-dory
Are you okay
Okay
How about you cutie pie Ready for round two
In the morning darlin in the morning we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E Now I know I put you guys through hell and I know I 've been one rough pecker but from here on end you guys are in my cool book Scotty help me pick Richie up and lay him down Jacob keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says Digayo When you get to Digayo turn this big bastard left go on down for a few miles then you see a bar called The Titty Twister From what I hear you ca n't miss it
You 're gon na let us go
Get it and bring it up here will ya please

You must have a bible in here do n't cha
Yeah
You damn well better Go
Yes
Do you believe me
Yes
You got three minutes One second longer I shoot your father in the face Do you understand what I just said
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth 's head He 's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable He knows exactly how he 's going to cross the border Whistling a happy tune he turns and walks back into room 9
Creepy guy
Feel this real wood paneling That 's real wood too not that fake stuff
see this television
you got your shower
you got your sink
you got your microwave
Why just look at all this You got your kitchen
CHASE I would say that 's a very safe assumption
HOUGE Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers that the Bureau the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally
CHASE This ca n't be confirmed at this time but we do believe it to be true We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store 's clerk
HOUGE What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot
CHASE We 've received no news one way or the other We can only hope for the best
HOUGE Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene Gloria Hill
CHASE Yes it does Kelly We have already alerted the Mexican authorities They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice
HOUGE Agent Chase does it appear that they are heading for Mexico
CHASE For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours The Bureau local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko
Six-fifty

This conversation is over
All I 'm saying
These guys ai n't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana They do n't even know the meaning of the word barter You wan na stay in El Ray You give them thirty percent of your loot It 's scripture So it is written so shall it be done You want sanctuary you pay the price and the price is thirty percent

He needs our help
He 's right Kate Daddy 's dead He was too far away If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him I 'd fling it The only thing it 'll do is turn us into one of them
Actually our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man He 's a preacher
You could take their head off
Go out and bring it in I feel a song coming on
Yeah it 's mine
In that camper out there I saw a guitar I take it that 's yours
Okay I 'll have one
How 'bout you You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long Just do n't do nothin stupid and we 'll all get along fine Scotty you sure you do n't want a drink
What 'd you find Kathy
Wow
Uh do n't see it There 's no signature But hang on there 's a note to See Addendum Checking
Who signed as his sponsoring officer
Got it
Wickwire Thomas Dane See what you can find
Okay but You did n't have to do what you did Not for me
Or rank But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order
Who 's Lieuten
Do n't say my name
Administration Ensign Blondell
More than you 'd guess It 's just that we do n't hold coffee klatches If more then three of us get together at any one time the guys think it 's some kind of uprising
But are there I mean how many
Just a friend We have friends too you know
The woman I saw you with
I 've been accused of that wish
I do n't know if there 's any single reason But my father was Navy And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den It showed a girl trying on a sailor 's uniform while saying Gee I wish I were a man I 'd join the Navy Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it and even then it felt wrong Made me mad And I do n't think a month has gone by that I have n't thought about that poster Gee I wish I were a man
Just some of the women
Who 's we
Can I ask you somethin lieutenant How come you 're doing this I mean we 're kinda curious
That 's what I hear
They take you away to San Clemente Island Half the guys quit when they come back Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half
No problem lieutenant
Thank you ensign
B.O.Q south side Take a starboard tack out the door
Then set out the good plates we 'll all have lunch My office will follow up with details Jumping off now
Of course but there 's more
Security What the hell you talkin about Your base is n't secure
Uh V.I.P security arrangements generally take some time Senator
Jordan dear How are they treating you
Standing right here in my office
Awright How 's our girl doin anyway
Your prerogative Senator
Well seein 's how this thing is out you let me handle the r.p.m From this point forward I want all press matters coordinated via my office I 'll be god-damned if I 'm gon na watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one Him or the President This my shade Midnight Mahogany 'Cuz I 'm comin dangerously close to lookin like Ronald Reagan here
Are you truly mouthin off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee I mean I 'll give you points for style just nothin for smarts
nothing I can do about it unless you 're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties which I 'd happily do if you 'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution
and now I got reporters from Toadsquat Iowa calling my office and askin what I know about this G.I Jane thing
Senator they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses
Commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill These were supposed to have been discreet test cases
Basically he asked me if I could unring a bell
Sir What did he say
Well if you had to go over my head lieutenant that 's the way to do it Christ nothin like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there
I 'm not sure what
Sir If tomorrow I was not under your command would the inquiry still go forward
I do n't see how O'Neil Dismissed
Sir please if there 's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud
I find this as distasteful as you lieutenant But if it 's on my desk it 's on my shoulders There 's going to be an inquiry it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty You should prepare yourself
I 'm saying we 're just friends
Sir if someone is suggesting that I 'm a lesbian they 're wrong
I do n't know of any delicate way to say this lieutenant so I wo n't try Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization of the same-sex variety Specifically that you were seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming
Permission to evaporate O'Neil
Permission to leave sir
We 'll all have lunch Good idea Oh and let 's be sure to invite this sociologist too just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS
Sir I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this Not this article not
You makin friends with the press lieutenant
See me sir
You 'll get everything you want O'Neil Let 's see if you want what you 're gon na get
So I 'll get a fair shot
Then good night
Would n't dream of it sir
And if you just happen to wash out I wo n't have to contend with you bitchin to some hairy-chested female Senator And please note I did not identify any one in particular
Across the board sir
Straight up
Same rules for everyone sir
Well 'Least now we 're talking the same language So one standard Is that what you 're after
The shape does n't bother me It 's just that goddamn rotten stench
No sir WHAT
No sir
What I resent lieutenant is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men the day-care center I have to build where an officer 's lounge used to be and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears But most of all lieutenant I resent your perfume however subtle it may be competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty nine cent cigar which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities DOES IT
I think you 've resented me from the start sir
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander If so I regard that as a bonafide brain fart and I resent it when people fart inside my home
Pardon
Did you just have a brain-fart
I ca n't afford civility sir How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you 've got me set up as an outsider Even if I make it under these rules I still lose because there 'll always be a flag in my file Yeah she made it but I mean really why did n't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base
Because I was civil now you 're complaining
It 's this double-standard the separate quarters the deferential treatment It 's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met
Oh really
It 's you sir And it started the day I came here
All right lieutenant give me a name and specifics I 'll have the X.O file an action first thing in the morning A name
Did n't take long
Pardon the hour sir But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way
If you were like everyone else lieutenant I suspect we would n't be making statements about not making statements would we Take your leave
Sir I just want you to know I 'm not here to make a statement I do n't want to make men look foolish All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience just like everyone else I suspect
Then that 's all I have to say Dismissed
None at this time sir
I 'm not out to change your sex lieutenant You 'll have separate beds separate heads If you have specific medical needs inform the infirmary If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately Questions
Really I have no problem with
Do n't worry about it If it 's off your collar and out of your eyes that 's all I 'm going to ask
Barber was my next stop sir Would 've had it regulation sooner only
Thank you sir But I expect a certain amount of pain
So We 're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this for integrating the Spec-Recon training It may not always be smooth but we 're trying to make it as painless as possible for you
I 'm fine sir
Would you care for a beverage Tea
Thank you sir
Yes of course Please have a seat lieutenant
West
Entering my scan now
Newberry get a photo South
No problem sir
Fine by me sir
Motherachrist
Ah c'mon
Sir
Aw what is this
O'Neil Our air 's gon na crap out as soon as we get down there You know that do n't you
What we 're gon na pry 'em out with paddles
Fuck me
Banditos on the east perimeter 150 yards Shit she was part of it
Hey Ai n't your call man
Only blanks Lem me do it
I ai n't gon na shoot her
Smoke her
Shit Think we 're had
'S AIDE Not that The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would in one stroke void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
She made it through S.E.R.E training Got a call this morning from
'S AIDE Did you hear
Yes
'S AIDE Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing They 'll never know whose leak it is
Think I overplayed it
I 'll act surprised
'S AIDE White House boys want a private meeting
That aside for the moment I 'm struck by the tenor the ill-spirit of your report the degrading remarks by other aviators innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior In my seven years on this committee I 've never seen a downed aviator treated like this Never I 'm deeply disturbed by this report Mr Hayes Not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier
I 'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything Mr Hayes
I 'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of
Yes I see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else 's And your conclusion was pilot error hmm
I was one member of the investigating commission
The Navy 's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier Female aviator it just so happens You 're familiar with this report and its conclusion am I right
Madam Senator this is an internal document of the U.S Navy I must seriously question whether
The Lark Report
Well I 'm just an old dame without much time left so you 'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type I am deeply concerned over the Navy 's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military Case in point
Hardly the case Senator
Whoa whoa whoa Land-based maritime specialties Gim me a second here to de-euphemize that
last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service particularly in the land-based maritime specialties What 's more the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on
Well I spoke with Mr Hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off No more test cases He was only too happy to oblige Do n't play politics with me little darlin You 'd be up way past your bedtime
You know I wonder what the SecNav would think about it If I spoke with him
You 'll think about my offer
I 'm sure it is
I 've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began And that 's quite verifiable
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket too
I once promised you a fast ticket Jordan and I always meant to make good on that Come work for me I can always use a hard-charger on my team
I wanted the choice The chance to prove myself my skills my work me That 's how it should 've been
The reality is this We send far too many men off to war I do n't need to compound the problem with women Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with
So the rhetoric gets you headlines But the reality gets you in trouble
Jordan I do n't expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there 's more to be gained from the fight than the victory
You were never going to let women serve in combat You always had a safety net Or thought you did
I 'm saying it 's not going to happen Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags
What are you saying That a women 's life is more valuable than a man 's That a women 's death hurts a family more
In face I do Roper Harris Gallop they all come back the same
You do n't know that
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire Because he knows what I know that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way
So Is n't the President jumping on your bandwagon
If I have to ask again Senator I 'll be asking in front of cameras
Should probably ask him that
What changed
Wickwire was there to help To be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot At least that was the intent
Absolutely not
Did you set me up Did you set me up just to see me fail
Jordan Might we do this over lunch tomorrow I do very much want to talk but now is scarcely
It should You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me
Sounds familiar
You know him
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire
Jordan I always hoped we 'd get together though just now I 'm gearing up for a child-care vote that
Gon na be visiting that all-woman 's America 's cup team in a few weeks If I were a gambler I 'd say Dennis O'Conner 's days are numbered But they 're in San Diego so I thought I 'd take a quick promenade of the base
Uh ma'am
Hmmm Maybe I 'll ask when I see you in person
Ca n't complain ma'am
There 'll be more to follow but yes dear right now you 're the pick of a very large litter And your success would mean a lot Jumping now
Would I be the only one The only woman
Yes dear
Uh question ma'am
My office will fill him in and help expedite Look forward to meeting you at the proper time Jumping off now
Captain Dwyer Technically
This is just a test case O'Neil But if it works out if you work out it could well change the Navy 's official policy on women in combat Or actually its official non-policy Now who 's your immediate superior there
I know that sir Ma'am It 's just that Beggin your pardon Senator but do you understand that this involves combat training
California
Coronado
High-school pentathlete ROTC scholarship graduated with honors top marks in Basic Training and as it just so happens a constituent of my home state of Virginia Oh the things I 'll do for one extra vote
Thank you ma'am Um may I ask what this is regarding
So everyone I talk to says you 're top drawer with silk stockings inside
G.I Jane And which one of you told me she would n't last a week Huh
OFFICER 1 I think it 's more important sir to decide what we 're going to do since it 's apparent this issue is not going away quietly
What the hell is the President trying to do Steal DeHaven 's thunder
OFFICER 1 Does n't matter who she picks No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course And I do n't care who it is
Then I suggest we start there
OFFICER 1 I 'd go Special Reconnaissance Every bit as tough and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men
So she picks the women we pick the programs Seals
Spotted you Chief Pri One is to slip you some air so we 're coming down with a tank just something until the A-team shows Over
Six o'clock Marking marking
Flea 'Cool Cortez Newman take your minis hit the water Go GO
Close as I can get el-tee
Fuck Basher-Basher this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction Stand by for a PRC fix
Really do n't wan na be captured el tee Heard some bad things
'Snot me It 's him
Hey You okay Flea
Do that
I 'll work on it ma'am
Well Flea I appreciate the respect you just showed me But I do n't need it and do n't want it not that kind of respect anyway It 's just gon na hurt us both okay
No ma'am
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size
It 's really F Lee Montgomery but that gets whittled down to just Flea For short ma'am
Montgomery why do they call you Flea
JOHNS You 're wanted at the C.O 's
Sir
JOHNS O'Neil
JOHNS Flea O'Neil Why is there a break in that line
Come on Montgomery
JOHNS If you ca n't feel the other guy 's pecker you ai n't in tight enough I want nuts to butts
Just do it okay
JOHNS two one MARK
I can make this wall without
JOHNS Do n't have to use it O'Neil but it 's got ta go out Five four three
CHIEF I think you probably would if you did n't know I was right
PYRO I oughtta report you
CHIEF Of course it is And I 'm gon na stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing that real lives are gon na be lost Maybe mine maybe yours
PYRO She 's a women and that 's why you 're ridin her bareback
CHIEF She 's an officer There 's a higher standard
PYRO She 's a trainee just like the others Why are you coming down so hard
CHIEF I 've had it Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter does n't mean I 'm gon na be one
PYRO You broke a dozen training rules back there before I lost count
CHIEF You do n't think she 'd be raped if she were captured You do n't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men
PYRO Get it up
CHIEF Boat Five Wickwire Cozad Vinyl Intagliata Ayers and Wise Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer Follow his orders to your death
CHIEF Every class has its surprises Pyro This one 'll be no different
PYRO Miller Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium Really did n't expect to lose him
CHIEF Check your watch Pyro Seems fast
PYRO Time
PYRO Maybe it 's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts But I think the Chief knew that his way his world had come and gone
Just a coincidence
PYRO The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday By 18-hundred he was gone Out of the Navy
I was looking for him earlier but
PYRO I believe he earned it for saving a man 's life in Saudi Arabia He wanted you to have it He was very clear on that point
The Navy Cross
What all females If I 'm the only
PYRO Automatic five-second deduction which slips you under the wire It 's called gender-norming O'Neil standard procedure for all females in physical training courses Where you been the last few years
PYRO You 'll try what we tell you to try O'Neil Go regulation
I 'll try anyway sir
PYRO Not doin them very fine O'Neil
Thank you sir But I like these just fine
Yes Jordan I 'll wait for you no matter how long
Which is guy-speak for
Look It 's not like you 'd be completely out of reach And maybe we could call in a few favors get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado There are ways of dealing with these things I mean if people are so inclined
So here we are again Staring three years of operational duty in the face
Yeah Me too
I 'd sure like to know who
You do n't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country He 's got a Sea Daddy somewhere
Wickwire Thomas Dane Second run at Coronado and correct they had him stashed in the Appropriation Liaison Office whatever that is
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado
What
In Washington
Well pardon me if I do Now who else Who could 've leveraged a class officer like that C'mon Jordan keep your head in the game
I do n't know I do n't care
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy
Sounds like an amazing coincidence
Instructors typically pull three year assignments This guy 's in and out in one year your year That sound right
What about him
John James Urgayle The Chief
Well before you crawl off to die Jordan give me five minutes of good headwork
I 'm tired of fighting back I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay
Someone screwed you over like this left unanswered charges hanging over your head and you 're not gon na fight back
It 's done with Royce Let it go
C'mon Jordan Do the headwork with me
The Chief Or maybe even Turrentine Your C.O
No shortage of suspects
Almost like someone put him up to it Okay who
Maybe Though it did n't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it Almost like Did I say he was class officer
And this class officer Wickwire You think he was just trying to get even Striking back for
All I wanted was an honest chance And If I could n't get it I could n't stay
Sure I 'll join the crowd
Jordan You watch your ass
Still ca n't make up your mind huh Got ta go Royce
That 's not what I want Jordan I mean it is and it is n't
Well let me warm you I 'm going though with this The more everybody fucks with me fucks with my head the more it just makes me want to finish So do n't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon okay
I 'm only trying to warn you in case
You know Royce I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too
Big symbols make big targets Jordan I think someone 's gunning for you
So why are you telling me this
I ca n't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about G.I Jane You 're all over the place and whether you wanted it or not the feminists are sizing you up for that poster
I saw an article
Do n't you know How they 're talking about you
Me Why me
Well not this I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago Got some fresh stuff about you You may be in a hostile camp I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn
I feel like there 's men here there 's women here then there 's men But hey what 'd I expect
That bad
How hard they making it on you
It 's hard to find time to sleep Royce Much less keep up with my phone life
I 've been trying you for five days Do n't they give you messages
Thank you Royce It was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy Really thank you so much
Jordan
You know right up until you said that I thought I did know
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth But I 'm trying to be honest okay Three years is a long time Do n't ask me to predict how I 'll feel then Jordan because I do n't know And either do you
Which is guy-speak for
I do n't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life Jordan Maybe we should just let it happen
Wai wait What happens if it works Four months of training three years of operational duty What then
I 'll try to keep the door open If you wash out I make it so that
Sorry But after our days So if I try this thing if I ship out to Coronado what happens here
You 're such a ball-breaker sometimes Especially at night
Get your dick back here It has everything to do with you
Well guess I do n't even need to be here
This has nothing to do with you
So dump on me
You need operational duty to really advance you need combat training to go operational yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits I 'm topped out at Intel Forget the glass ceiling I 'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling
She 's haze grey and underway
Royce We 're the same age we started the same time and now you 're sitting in the upperdecks while I 'm still down in the bullpen What does that tell you about the Navy
Well you 're doin shit-hot at Intel
I take it you do n't either Feet
Spec-Recon Those guys are world class warriors And they will not want you there Jordan
Just like you would be
So why 're you even considering it Are you
Is this my glory sir
By the way I 'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here
Intel has its own glory lieutenant no matter how subtle
Hate this part Just sweating it out on the sidelines
Probably hear back from CNN first
Thank you sir We hear back from the Pentagon
That was good headwork lieutenant
Only four minutes to neutral waters sir Why not
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back Is that correct O'Neil
Quick-hit technique used by Capone Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride Check the files DPRK-57 I doped it out as a contingency plan Seal Team infiltrates picks up the package links up with recovery sub But do n't waste time opening and closing hatches They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters
Blank faces here O'Neil
Unless you Whiskey Run
Halfway 'round the world So that 's the problem we can get the team in just not out
North Korean beaches are the best protected most heavily monitored in the world The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system Extraction team has to be small and silent I 'd go with Seals over Delta Force Problem is do n't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice Where 's The Polk
You 're the analyst for East China O'Neil Analyze
Chances of recovery
Signals received only sparingly in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries
Do we know it 's him using the beacon Not a decoy
Not due in for 22 minutes sir Watcha got
Got ta situation here Where are you Stuck in traffic
Lieutenant O'Neil
This is insane You 've got no proof
I 'm sorry O'Neil But as class officer it 's my obligation to report all violations
Okay Well thought I 'd ask
We 're going over to her place to make salad and pasta Just you know nothing special
Sure sure
Do you uh know
Thanks for lying But you 're the class officer Wick and it 'd just be weird if we hook up Besides
I think you look beautiful
I ca n't go out Not like this
Maybe I 'll just head over to McP 's with the others have a drink or four Do n't wan na come do you
First big night of liberty and no date You 're pathetic Wickwire
That 's okay Just an ex-girlfriend And know I remember why
Sorry did n't mean to
Let 's keep talkin Wick Just keep talkin to me
Last time I did n't
How 'd you make it last time Wick How 'd you get through this part
O'Neil
Not me You
You got anybody Wick
At first
He was married
So the shit you got ta go through To get from here to there Brother said it was worth it Worth the training worth the divorce worth anything
That 's a good story
Nah they were dead-ass asleep But on every guard 's chest they left one Marlboro cigarette Just a little calling card to say they 'd been there and could come back any time they wanted
They had to kill 'em
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline This is like right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense So his crew does a nighttime infil maps all the big artillery placements and stuff then turns around to get the hell gone But between them and the water are five Libyan guards all armed to the nuts
If you got a good one Wick
When I was sittin behind a desk in Washington it made sense somehow Blame it on my big brother He was Spec-Recon And the stories he used to tell
You really came back for more Of this
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast They found his tracks Well shit
Wick They got your crew too
You know I had an apartment about this size once
Who is it
Thanks Wick
Hey Way to gut it out
You 're kind of a surprise yourself
I did n't know they let you try again Especially at your age
Made it to Week 10 last time
And how do you know that
It was made clear Anyway stay ballsy First week 's hell then it levels out Until S.E.R.E training anyway That 's hell-and-a-half
Whose orders were those
It was made clear before you came harassment equals career suicide Ca n't say anything good so they do n't say much at all To your face anyway
Well now I feel so much better
They 're more afraid of you
Grab an oar find a way to weight it down we 're gon na need it Cortez help him Flea You take one of the two full minis and just follow my lead
Maybe half Not even
So we got two full mini-tanks three minutes each 'Cool How much air in yours
Smoke it
'Cool
I 'm lookin I 'm lookin
32 feet six inches
Mighta been civilian
If not firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area Now how smart is that
I do n't know
She part of the training
What you gon na give it all up for a maple twist How dumb you got ta be That 's exactly what they
Just askin
What 're you guys doing Huh
Shut up sir I 'm concentrating
CHIEF O'Neil
Show us where you are Chief
CHIEF Got it
15 sir
CHIEF Say again How many micks
Chief sir rescue team wo n't be here for 15 minutes What 's your air situation Over
CHIEF Managed to activate the ELB If you just radio base and let them know they 'll fix on that Oh and make sure they send a helo with a winch door 's blocked by a reef Over
CHIEF Okay O'Neil So you 've impressed all the others Now try me
Good to see you again too sir
CHIEF Well I 'm trying to figure out if you 're stupid unlucky gluttonous or some new alloy of all three
CHIEF I think we oughtta practice it just so you know what to expect
Sure Just like your men do
CHIEF Did n't you know you 'd be raped if you were captured Did n't you even think about that
CHIEF I 'm so glad we agree
No
CHIEF Do you
CHIEF You think we should go easy on women O'Neil
We did n't know we were compromised Firing would only 've given away our position
CHIEF I 'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage You wear the bars you made the call and you got your whole crew
I think you 're the liar
CHIEF That 's what your crew said Are they lying Or are you
That 's not right
CHIEF The others already told me O'Neil They wanted to shoot but you would n't let them Because you went soft on another women
No Yes I mean depends on
CHIEF Would you have shot if it was a man
CHIEF She led us right to you That 's no threat
Was n't deemed a threat
CHIEF Why did n't you shoot the woman O'Neil
CHIEF Right down to your worthless womb and I 'll tell you why This is my island My world And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world Take another scan of my little joy boy outside If I can do that to a Navy Seal what 's gon na happen to you Huh
Should I be afraid
CHIEF You are in the cage O'Neil Right here right now
Green Eggs and Ham You 're not going to get anywhere You might as well put me in the cage
CHIEF Are you hungry What 's your favorite food We 'll try to get it for you
Dick Jane and Spot
CHIEF Any brothers Sisters
Dad
CHIEF Simple question lieutenant No reason not to answer What is your father 's name
CHIEF You were commissioned one month earlier which makes you the senior officer Remember There are no bad crews only bad leaders
McCool 's that same rank We 're both j.g 's
CHIEF England went out with a stress fracture That puts you in charge lieutenant
It also seems like a problem with the men 's attitude sir So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead
CHIEF Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion Men fight better without women around And that is an historical fact
CHIEF Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear lieutenant
I see So when a man tries to rescue another man he 's a hero But when he tries to rescue a woman he 's gone soft
CHIEF For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia
Sir someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross May I ask what you got it for
CHIEF It seems the men could n't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs Israeli men would linger over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission often endangering their own lives They do n't use women anymore
Permission to get dressed sir
CHIEF Educate her Pyro
Chief sir I do n't understand why
CHIEF You heard me Move on
Say again sir
Shut your hole Slutnik
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard
FLEA KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT Mark it mark it Cortez What the hell you waiting for
You do n't suppose this is just part of
Cortez see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear Try a wrench on that thing
I just wonder how that happened
MOVE
Sure Now she wants to shoot
All right fire-and-evade maneuvers Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio we 're gon na be high speed low drag all the way to the link-up site Ready
North

We are so fucked
Darth Vader reads poetry

SPOOK This is what you get for brain picking an old CIA spook but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case that 's how I 'd do it A man-in-place Makes everything very controllable
I do n't What someone on base A mole
SPOOK Okay so now work it from the other end Think about California and how things might be handled there
Even tough I do n't talk to her every day I still talk to her every day Know what I mean
SPOOK I take it this file is still open
Christ I do n't want to see her take a fall She thinks I do but
SPOOK This ai n't about some little soldier girl sloggin her way through commando school The implications go way beyond
I do n't know Seems
SPOOK If you were the President would n't that put a little piss in your shoes
Women
SPOOK Do n't for a second think she did n't leak this story G.I Jane gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all
The first female President
SPOOK The White House If Jordan wins DeHaven wins in spades Why Well it 's been said that the only man the President fears ai n't no man
SPOOK Hmm Let 's aim higher
Possibly Just to spite DeHaven
SPOOK Sabotage born of economics Would n't be a first But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure
The Navy They 've made it clear they do n't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women 's heads What 's it gon na cost to make a fleet of Trident 's co-ed
SPOOK Congress cuts military bleeds But Pentagon 's a big place Let 's narrow the sights
The E-Ringers Full integration is gon na cost the services billions at the worst possible time when Congress is already swinging the axe
SPOOK All right So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way
SPOOK Sorry Thought you knew I knew
You knew about us
SPOOK Thought you two were file-closed

The JFK In the rain
You 're crazy go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK
Cut uptown take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway
Oh yes he will
He 's not going to do it
Only one way to find out
Think we can fit up in there
Yes Definitely Definitely enough
Do n't you think we have enough
It 's the maintenance entrance Runs along the side of the tunnel When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it
What are you doing
Lucy 'd kill me if she knew
What are you doing
Look you want to make it up to your friend Well if he 's right this is your chance
Animal I ca n't
Perfect You wanted a story well baby you got one
My God He 's going after the nest
I just saw him He 's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight
Yeah Why are you asking
Did n't you tell me he left for the airport
Yeah I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me
You made a mistake
It 's all my fault What have I done Animal What have I become Look at me This is n't me I do n't do things like this
You okay
We know Audrey
He stole my report That 's my report
Sure I was I thought Lucy was gon na kill me
Great stuff Animal Were n't you scared
Nearly four years
How long where you and dis guy goin steady
No I just could n't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches I wanted to have some adventure some fun
That why you dumped him
Well I can be tough if I want
Nice guys finish last First rule of the jungle
Animal you do n't think that 's true do you
You know how I spent last weekend Walking his damned dog
I like that image
Oh just some insurance guy
Who was that French guy anyway
Really I 'd like to find out
You 'd be surprised
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting
Are you okay
Oh my God They 're coming
If the military are listening they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape
Your station wo n't have any easier time contacting the military than I did
The network is on an intranet It 's a direct feed into our computer system
Our network covers the Ranger games
How do you know
Come on the broadcast booth is right over here
I know a way I know how you can get a message out of here
Circuits are overloaded
I was wrong
I thought you said there 'd only be a dozen eggs
What are you doing here
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes
I did n't mean for it to turn out like this Look I lied to you I 'm not a reporter When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I 'd make it But I have n't That 's why I needed this story so bad I just could n't tell you I 'm a failure
I should n't have to Audrey You 're supposed to be my friend I trusted you
You never said it was off the record
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen
Is this cause of me Because of the story
Yes Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time
Nesting
The ultimate expression of evolution it reproduces asexually Think about it all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction That 's why he came to New York Like every species of insufficient progenitors he 's nesting
I do n't get it If it 's the first of its kind how can it be pregnant
Well obviously these tests were n't designed for this but fundamentally they 're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy
Are you sure
he 's pregnant
What else do you know about it
I got pretty close
Blood sample How close did you get to that thing
Yes The first of its kind I found this blood sample earlier this evening
And you think this creature is one of them
I have this theory that we 're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we 've done to nature
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect
When you and I use to attend rallies in college we helped to create awareness But from the inside now I can actually effect change I never lost my idealism
I still ca n't believe it How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Sure I 'd like that
Wait I 'm sorry You 're right Eight years is a long time Can I offer you a cup of tea
I 'm sorry you feel that way
Most people do n't
That was eight years ago Some people change you know
You just left me without a phone call a letter nothing All this time Yeah I guess I 'm still a little mad
You 're still mad at me are n't you
No I 'm into earthworms now You would n't be interested They 're real boring creatures Very reliable dependable no surprises
So you still picking apart cockroaches
Yeah well
You 're a reporter That 's what you always wanted to be right I 'm happy for you Really I am
What
So you made it
It 's good to see you Nick
Audrey Is that you Hi hello You look wow uh how 've you been
You must have quite some harem
I 'll take them all
I 'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity Luce If there 's a story here I 'm going to find it
Audrey I do n't think this is a very good idea Caiman finds out and he 'll have your job
Wish me luck
I left my forgery kit back at the office
Yeah well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama There 's a story here I know it You got any tape or glue
Your old sweetheart
Remember my friend we saw on t.v
What the hell are you doing
That 's the problem He did
Four years Girl I 'm surprised he did n't ask you to marry him
Nick Tatopoulos
Did Romeo have a name
He was my college sweetie Look at him He looks so handsome on t.v What the hell is he doing in Panama
Who is he
It 's Nick I know that guy I know him
He 's scum As far as he 's concerned you 're just a pair of breasts that talk
I ca n't believe he put the moves on me After everything I 've done for him
Oh please your life does n't suck His life sucks
My life sucks
Speak of the devil
And I 'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman 's expense p.o 's
You 're kidding right
Five bucks
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man
What do I get
Can I use some
What 's it to you
Hey do you have any glue in your bag
Not anymore Mr Caiman I quit
I want that story Audrey Remember you work for me
We I do n't think so
We did it We 've got the exclusive Way to go Audrey
Listen this is the time when the big boys have to go to work okay Honey
You do n't understand I can get us information
Not now You got my bag
I 've got something on this I know a guy on the inside with the military
What
Caiman wait Take me with you
It 's your choice
I ca n't
So have dinner with me tonight
Mr Caiman I 've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year And I 've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me I 'm too old to be an assistant anymore I need to know this job is going someplace
Call me Charlie
Mr Caiman
And you 're beautiful
Mr Caiman you 're married
Are you serious He 's going to consider me for he job What else did he say
He said he 'd consider it It 's between you and Rodriguez
Just tell me did you talk with him
This is not the place
Did you talk with Humphries
I 'll try
Make sure they find that nest before it 's too late
Me too
I 'm sorry about all this
I do n't think so
Evacuate Manhattan That 's over three million people Has that ever been done before
More than that I believe this is a mutated aberration a hybrid from the fall out in that region
Hence the radiation
Oh thank you Is she always like this
Well I think you 're cute
Not for a long time now
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart
No Perhaps I work too much
Really A girlfriend then
Oh I 'm not married
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl How did Mrs Tatopoulos handle it
Ah Elsie Chapman paleontologist
Hi Nick Tatopoulos
Nick my men and I will hold them here You will have to go and get help
They did n't make it
Where 's Luc and Pierre
We 've secured the doors on both levels
That is when we will go in
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten
Allez allez
Merde
HICKS Fill them with cement brick them up put land mines in them bombs I do n't know just make sure that goddamned thing does n't leave the island
ANDERSON And how should we do that Sir
HICKS Have them sealed off
ANDERSON Only five Sir We 've checked them all He has n't used any of them
HICKS Christ How many tunnels lead off the island
ANDERSON When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone
HICKS Get your people out of there or I will
Major what do you think could have done this
HICKS Well your people are getting in the way of my job
That is our job
HICKS You 're fast
CHARGEURES property and casualty insurance We are preparing a report
They are with me
HICKS Who are they Lieutenant get those people away from there
No it 's still in my tent It 's oh my God she took it
HICKS You gave them the tape
It may be too late by then These eggs will hatch very quickly
HICKS So after we kill the creature we 'll begin a search for the nest
No it reproduces asexually That 's why we must find the nest If we do n't dozens will be born each one capable of laying eggs of its own Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population
Um excuse me sir but the situation 's more complicated than that The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has
HICKS You see all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do n't rely on heat seeking
Well yes I did Clearly he was injured and bled
When I needed to catch earthworms I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them I had to draw them out
HICKS What are you suggesting
You know he 's not an enemy trying to evade you He 's just an animal
What do we know It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years
HICKS Do n't tell me why it 's not tell me what the hell it is
The radiation is not an anomaly it 's the clue This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur
HICKS It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over
Somebody must have seen it
HICKS We 're hoping you 're going to help us figure that out
But there 's no animal in the world that can make prints like that Is there
HICKS That 's right
That was a footprint I was standing inside a footprint
HICKS You 're standing on it
What sample
HICKS Then you 're perfect Here 's your radioactive sample Study it
They 're enormous A new species created by man 's recklessness That 's what I 've been trying to tell you I 'm only a biologist I take radioactive samples and study them
HICKS Seventeen percent huh Sounds big
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before Mutated by seventeen percent
HICKS No but I have the feeling I 'm about to find out
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm 's DNA You have any idea what that means
HICKS Yeah you 're the worm guy
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm
HICKS We know
Look I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field
HICKS We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise
You did n't answer my question In fact for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions
HICKS Follow me
Excuse me would you mind telling me what the hell I 'm doing here
HICKS Right The worm guy Can someone get those people off the beach
It 's Tatopoulos
HICKS Dr Niko Topopolosis
You do n't have the authority to do that
HICKS Organize a search party I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system
That thing 's dead What the hell are we waiting for
HICKS We 're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body
Do you have any idea what 's going on out there The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city
HICKS That 's not true Our worm guy er I mean Dr Tatopoulos found blood
Last time you did n't even scratch it
HICKS General Anderson the problem was the terrain If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park We should be able to take him down
But you do n't know for sure
HICKS We think there 's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area
Wait Au revoir
I just wanted to say au revoir and thank you for your help my friend
I understand
Where are you
It 's Raymond
Hello
It 's okay I know her
Who the hell are you
I ca n't get through I do n't know what 's wrong
What 'd they say
555-7600 Tell them it 's a code dragonfly They should get you through
How do I do that
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape
Good idea
I think we should leave now
You were right
Three eggs I thought there would be more
Let 's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres
They 've turned off the ventilation system They 're calling him to dinner
Makes us look more American
What 's with the chewing gum
Are you kidding I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion
So you 're in
Here 23rd street subway station Where we first found the fish With a little luck this will lead us right to it
Yes This testing done by my country left a terrible mess We are here to clean it up
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific
It is my job to protect my country Sometimes I must even protect it from itself From mistakes we have made Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about
Sure
I am a patriot I love my country Can you understand that
I am not permitted to speak of such things
So why all the secrecy Why are n't you guys working with the US military
This is America There is nothing you can not buy
How did you get all of this stuff into the country
We have already taken care of them
Oh my bags I 've checked them in
I need your trust if you 're to help me find the nest
Why do you need that
I need you to trust me
Why are you telling this to me
We know
Are you sure How do you know
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature 's nest
Oh
It 's the French Secret Service
Sounds like a big company
SDECE Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage Agent Phillip Raymond
Oh yeah the insurance guy

That 's your problem You were never serious about the caraft I 'm a rock I just want to be a rock Still Peaceful Tranquil Oh but what 's this Something 's making noise No not noise no MOVEMENT VIBRATIONS Make the vibrations stop they go straight into me like a knife I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations
It 's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER It does n't HAVE motivation
Well you have to figure out what it wants What 's its motivation
ALEXANDER PLEASE You 're my advisor advise me
KILL IT Well I 'm open to ideas
Fred 's no good Jason You 're going to have to kill it
I heard something A squeal
Nothing
What What
Oh of course I forgot YOU have to be the hero do n't you Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once Oh no Jason Nesmith could n't possibly
You go first There 's no time
Go ahead
Must be some sort of mining facility
There it is The Beryllium sphere
THIS much
What 's the scale Is that ten miles A hundred miles
About this much
KEEP GOING KEEP GOING
DO N'T BE INSANE STOP FULL STOP
NO WE 'RE ALMOST THROUGH
Like YOU know
You do n't hold a thruster down It 's for quick boosts
We stop we die Keep holding the thruster down Tommy
We 've got to stop
Like throwing gasoline on a fire
At ease men
Just
Calm down everybody We 're just here to negotiate General Sarris surrender
COME IN PROTECTOR PROTECTOR
God what an ass
Leadership
to camera center no matter whose shot you 're blocking
I 'm glad you asked To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty
Damn you Damn you
The show must go on
I wo n't and nothing you say
You WILL go out there
Friend You stole all my best lines You cut me out of episode two entirely
Come on old friend
As a matter of fact I do Look at their eyes They 're obviously nocturnal Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31
You have a better plan Alex
This is ludicrous Why are you listening to this man Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume not a uniform He 's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow No offense
Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps
And note the sucked in gut
Hey watch that Laredo shit
You think you could do better Laredo
You know with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second
Shut up
You were holding it upside down were n't you
The engines are dead We 're drifting
What 's happened
They 're drifting toward me I think they 're magnetic
Could you possibly try not to hit every single one
No Jason that 's a wrap There 's nothing to think about
He wants to THINK
Jason what have you gotten us into
What the hell is going on
No I ca n't go out there I wo n't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time I wo n't I ca n't
Settle down Alex
I played Richard III
Not again
Oh and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us
He 's a twit
By Grabthar 's Hammer this is true 159 NT LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT 159
He always has to make the big entrance
Yes you did
No I did n't
Back there You said the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals
What
You said the Commander
Down there
He knocked me out the sonofabitch Where is he
It does n't make sense Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures
Those blue things ate everybody here
Nobody was WATCHING
I do n't know
Could they be the miners
Look at that Will you LOOK at that They look like little children
To see if there 's a pub
Alex Where are you going
Go into the cloud
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE
WE 'VE HAVE TO STOP
The ships are gaining
May I get the check
Shit I 'm doing it I 'm repeating the damn computer
We heard it the first time
All this from watching the historical records
Oh my god It 's real
Yes poor Jason As we speak he 's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring
I do n't know It just was n't like him
A boy comes to the door
You could order something in
I still have n't got this bloody thing off
Why did n't you stop at the market
Oh good there 's nothing to eat
Oh ca n't I Watch me
Alex you ca n't just leave
Dear God How did I come to this
Oh Alex get away from that thing
The guy is terminally selfish
He 's a miserable twit
We 'd better get everybody online And Kyle Stop downloading porn Your frame rate is unacceptable
I have sectors 1-28 I think Hector has the upper levels
You 've got the utility systems walkthrough right
Oh Okay
No time for pleasantries Kyle We have a level five emergency The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads
Hi Brandon
He probably Has some very important business to attend to
He dissed us AGAIN Brandon
Yeah What 's wrong JASON othIno I ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat
That 's It
Raise the glass and push the blue button
I 'm at the control oaneh What do I do
Berithium lava coming through Use the handholds above you
What Up
Up
Go They 're off again
GO Commander
Shit Go
Lt Madison GO
No wait are you
Wait two seconds then go
Okay now But
Commander you and Lt Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom
Yes Commander All right you 're almost there Just go through the chompers and over the pit
BRANDON TIME TO GO
My cousin 's boyfriend 's sister went out with the screenwriter His favorite movie is the Omegaman He 's seen it 13 times
How did you come to that conclusion
No I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer but a matter REARRANGER converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past
But you do n't
It 's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years Many believe that is a matter collapser a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds
What do you mean
Well that 's the big question is n't it
What does the Omega 13 do
Yes Commander
Brandon Just in case I die there 's something I have to know
Okay that 's where you want to be
Yes
Okay so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT Should be down at the far end to your left
We 'd never have the budget for this
Commander do you have a camera I 'd die to see this in person All they showed on T V was a machine here and a wall here I do n't know why they did n't show the whole thing
Now make a right you 'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility The bowels of the ship
Okay Okay now what
Okay now left at the next turn Past the oxygen units Make a right there Then go through the antimatter vent
Okay you can go on in I 'm going to get Kyle He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive
Okay we got it
Brandon The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help
I knew it I KNEW it
It 's real Brandon All of it It 's real
But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase okay I understand completely that It 's just a TV show There is no ship there is no Beryllium Sphere no diagital conveyor I mean obviously it 's all just a
It 's okay Listen
Yes I know and I want you to know I thought about what you said I know you meant it constructively but
Brandon I remember you from the convention right You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship and I spoke sharply to you
Brandon
What 's your name son
Oh Oh I see Oh
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday
Yes
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary There 's no goddamn ship Do you get it
Yes but we were wondering
It 's a television show Okay That 's all It 's just a bunch of fake sets and wooden props do you understand
Commander as I was saying In The Quasar Dilemma you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix so we were wondering where the error lies
Excuse me guys
Commander please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having In The Quasar Dilemma the Sentient had taken control of the ship 's guidance systems however
All systems are working Commander cc PINK C
Systems register functional
All systems are working Commander
Systems register functional
No we do n't have an extra Beryllium sphere
Negative no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard
We need another one
Negative The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced
It 's fractured
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress
Computer what about our engines Why do n't we have power
The enemy is matching velocity
The enemy is matching velocity
Guys we 're sustaining structural damage
The ship is sustaining structural damage
I never get tired of that joke
There is no weather in space
What 's the weather like outside
Yes
I just ca n't believe it Any of it Look at this room They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from historical document thirty seven Oh and wait wait listen to this Computer
We 're getting major structural damage
Structural damage at 68 percent
OK
TECH So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate A two molecule compound sharing a free electron and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes
Covalent Right So
TECH What does that mean Yes I see Yes It means that perhaps the bonding molecules have become covalent
What does that mean
TECH That possibly The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally
U What do you think
Hopkins ca n't drink your bathwater Fred
As good as Hopkins
You worked with Hopkins I worship Hopkins
Fred I worked summer stock with Hopkins Regional theater with Hoffman But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan You 're Mr Dependable You can do this
Listen Fred You did this for four years on the show You can do it now Put your hands on the controls
No I 'll kill you
I 'll take my chances with Gorignak
Right
The digital conveyer You mean I 'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces
No no I 'll think on it
Never mind Fred
A hologram
I Well uh Yes absolutely
Hey Commander Listen we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion What do you think
Maybe you 're the plucky comic relief you ever think of that
I 'm just a glorified extra Fred I 'm a dead man anyway If I 'm going to die I 'd rather go out a hero than a coward
It 's suicide
Listen I 'll go in create a distraction have this may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape
We 've got to get that valve turned off Their oxygen Is almost gone
Of course We 'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor
The digital conveyor
I do n't like this I do n't like this at all
You Okay Alex
Oh I make it up Use lots of k s and v s
How do you remember this stuff
We 're doing episode 31 Jason
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram
Let 's get out of here before one of those things kills guy
I am SO SICK of being right
Of course they 're cute NOW But in a second they 're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them
Oh they 're so cute
Something BAD happened here
Where are the miners
Do I DO I For all you know I 'm just CREWMAN 6 Okay it 's FLEEGMAN Guy FLEEGMAN There Now I 'm a whole person I ca n't die FLEEGMAN THEY CA N'T KILL ME NOW CAN THEY CAN THEY
Guy you HAVE a last name We just do n't KNOW it
The lost footage At the convention The mysterious device in our last episo historical document
The Omega 13 Why does that sound so familiar
It 's incredible
THAT 'S why you built this ship
You know us
Crewman 6 Call me Guy
Sure Guy If you can stand the excitement
Listen I was wondering would you guys mind if I sit in today See if anybody 's interested in an autograph Never know
No Keep all energy to the armor
We~re oetting hammered Jason Return fIre
A LATHE Get off the line Guy
I know You contruct a weapon Look around can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31
It 's a rough plan Guy What does it matter if we 're doing episode 31 or not
Jason are we doing Episode 31 or not
It does n't have to be a hologram Just a diversion
Let 's just pick up the pace a little shall we
That 's it that 's what 's going to kill me
All right let 's all settle down If we 're going to get through this we 're going to have to exercise self control
We 're screwed We 're so screwed
No Nobody does Do you know WHY Because my character Is n't IMPORTANT enough for a last name Because I 'm going to DIE five minutes in why bother to come up with a last name for me
It 's I do n't know
Yeah what is it
Your last name
Oh I 'm not I 'm not Then what 's my last name
Guy you 're not going to get killed on the planet okay
We should have a turbo I 'm always saying activate turbo boosters right
They 're still behind us
All right Put me back on with him
Okay
We made it Commander we made it
e 're alive
We made It Commander we made it m ALEXANDER sort ov By Grabtnar s h~mmer we ove to te ono 'tale
We 're alive
I think he just likes pointing at things
Not a clue You
You have no idea what a perimeter is do you
Where 'd they go Back inside
They 're gone
Whatever the one with the hologram The wall of fire
We 're doing episode 31
Assault on Voltareck III Episode 31 I think
Hey YOU want to drive
More to the left Stay parallel
Guy You probably do n't remember me do you I was on the show in '82 Episode 31 Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial Crewman 6
Hey Thanks for one nice intro uh
Hi everybody
TOMMY 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT
never doubted you for a second
Mark 12
He 's accelerating to Mark 6
Well forget it I 'm not going This episode was badly written
Because it was on the show
We should n't have to DO this It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE Why is it HERE
Gwen
What IS that thing It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK
Wait Jason Here
There 's no hatch There 's no hatch
No I do n't But I know somebody who does
Uh I hate to break it to you Jason but I do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor and unless you took a Learning Annex course I do n't know about I 'm pretty sure you do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either
Right
So We get to shut down the neutron reactor
What the hell are you talking about
Jason I do n't think the pig lizard was Gorignak
Turn on the translation circuit
Wait the pig lizard is gone Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard
Nothing Hold please
What What did he say
Jason we 're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there
Yeah But I 've got Gorignak staring me in the face I think I can take it though
Thank God Are you okay
Yes Yes I 'm here
Jason Can you hear me
Will you stop RIDING ME
Clenched jaw
It helps
How does the rolling help actually
Why does this sound so familiar
All right here 's the plan First Fred we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound then Gwen Alex Fred and I go down to get the sphere Any of those things come back give a signal Guy you set up a perimeter
Do n't be ridiculous
You 're playing your good side
I could have held on to YOU
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me
Self control That 's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show
Computer do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard
Computer can it be repaired
Can it be repaired
No I do n't think so Wait They 're not but Something is Oh my god
Are they behind us
I do n't think that 's a cloud
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud
Listen Sarris you ca n't blame me for trying
I thought It was the We 're dead gesture I was agreeing Like I know where the hold button is
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture You nodded okay
You just keep pushing those buttons those there send everything at him okay
JASON
We 're going to fire everything we 've got at him all right
Jason
All right now nobody panic I 've dealt with this guy before and believe me he 's as stupid as he is ugly
Mathesar maybe we should get some of your crew up here
There 's nobody here Jason
Let me think I need time to think
We 're leaving Jason We 're leaving NOW
Gwen Gwen c'mon wait no
We have no right to do this They deserve to know
Hey Hey where are you going
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment ACTING Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon she taught ACTING
It 's not the STUFF I mean anybody can learn the STUFF The important thing is COMMITMNT 99 of anything is just committing to it
Well you have to tell them What if something happens We 're actors not astronauts We ca n't do this stuff
Are you kidding I 'm not going to tell them
Who we are Do n't you think they 're going to be PISSED
Tell them About
Wait When are you going to tell them
C'mon we 're wanted up on the command deck
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says So that 's what they built
But I 'm the Commander
Only answers to me
Let me try Computer Computer
Oh come on it 's not like I haven't
One minute I 'm Hey I 'm dressing
It 's Jason
You know it 's one thing to treat us this way but how can you do this to your fans
This is n't mine Wait where is that kid
You smiled at me
What
What do you want me to say Gwen They wanted the Commander
How much of a nothing Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing
A few fans built a little set in their garage I come in for an hour at most It 's a nothing
I see them I see them RD STREET PASADENA 57
Tommy look Those lights
What are you doing What are thev doino 7C INT SARRIS SHIP h37C
Closer I can try
JASON You think you could-get any closer to those mines
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now
I heard it too
Wait Fred what about your thing you know Digitize me Sergeant Chen
That thing 's not going to get us down there fast enough Face it he 's dead
We got the Sphere but the Commander 's down there with a bunch of cannibals Teb reset the pod we 're going back
I ca n't It 's on autopilot
Oh my god Tommy Stop the pod Stop the pod
Sure no problem
I have ONE job on this lousy ship It 's stupid but I 'm going to DO it GOT IT
You know that 's really getting annoying
I do n't know guys I mean he almost looked sincere I know it 's bizarre
You should have let me hit him
Do n't do it Tommy He 's not worth it
That 's it It 's go time
Almost as much as he loves himself
You got ta admit they do love him
You are so full of shit
Unbelievable
Tomorrow morning before the store opening
You 're kidding When for
This is great They 're going to start eating each other out there
Where the hell is he An hour and a half late An hour and a half
This is embarrassing really I sha n't tell this story when I return home
Accelerate to Mark 4 Tommy
Yes You understand THAT do n't you Mathesar
We We lie
Simpler
We pretend
Our dimwitted friends do n't understand the concept of acting They have no theater no imagination these scientists
My name is Jason Nesmith I 'm an actor We 're all actors
Gwen The show There 's no choice Do it
Explain
Please do n't hurt them it 's not their fault I 'm not the Commander I do n't know anything
Wait What did you say
Do you think I 'm a fool That the Commander does not know every bolt every weld of his ship
No I swear I do n't know Please
Prepare a tear harness for the female
Stop please I do n't know
Is it a bomb A booby trap Tell me
I do n't know
Then tell me one thing What does it do the device The Omega 13
Yes
All right You got it You win I 'll deliver it now Just give me a moment to set it up
You have ten seconds
Listen I 'd like to but frankly I 'm not even sure where it is or even
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship
Right Well Listen I 'm I 'm sorry about that whole thing before It was kind of a misunderstanding I 'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people How 's the uh that going to heal up God I hope so I feel just awful about that
Better than my Lieutenant He failed to activate ship 's neutron armor as quickly as I 'd hoped on our last encounter
Yes Hi Sarris How are you doing
Okey dokey let 's fire blue particle cannons full Fire red particle cannons full Fire gannet magnets left and right Fire pulse catapults from all chutes And throw this thing at him too killer
First I require the Omega 13 Second
You can oc that
The ship is a model As big as this A very clever deception indeed He oa n't oontaln hIs lauchter A belle TOMMY Set a course for home lommander
It 's difficult to On our planet we pretend in order to entertain
But Why
Sections of rooms made of plywood Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster The digital conveyor was Christmas lights Decorations It 's all a fake I 'm not him I 'm a nothing A nobody
But Inside I have seen
A model only as big as this
But there it is
I 'm not a Commander there is no National Space Exploration Administration There is no snip
We have become aware of these concepts only recently In our dealings with Sarris Often Sarris will say one thing and do another Promise us mercy and deliver destruction It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris
Well Sort of
Deception Lies
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations The fault must lie with us with the ship
You what What are you talking about
A thousand apologies We have failed you
It 's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185
Mathesar What is that
Mathesar I need you to prepare pods for my crew
Commander
I 'm sorry You deserve to be shown
Former Commander
Our former Commander was not Strong
Then how did he find out about the device
NO Thank God he has not
Mathesar Has Sarris seen the historical records
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars we 'll be there this fine ship this fine crew Never give up never surrender
To our brave guests Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes We are blessed to count ourselves among them
Maintenance facility
It 's perfectly safe I promise
Weapons storage
It was a lot of fun You kids are great
How can we thank you Commander You You have saved our people
Thanks
An interstellar vox
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134 's a parking lot after 2:00 But listen the guy gives you any more trouble just give a call
He has a very powerful ship Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
Oh I do n't think so I gave him both barrels
But what if Sarris survives
Long live Theramini Take a left here
Theramin
Right Long live What 's your planet
But Commander The negotiation You You You fired on him
Yeah Earth Time to get back to Earth kids
You You mean Earth
Home
Commander Where are you going
As you wish
Mind If we skip that I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys
Commander Welcome to the Protector II Would you like to don your uniform
Oh right The thing with the thing Come on in I 'll get some pants on
Sir I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol but please I beg you to hear our plea We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey Sarris wants the Omega 13 We are to meet in negotiation However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous The flames the death Please Captain you are our last hope We have secured a limousine
Catch me later okay
I certainly but
Right If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent but make sure I have a limo from my house they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Commander I must speak to you It is a matter of supreme importance We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula and we require your help I beseech you to come with us back to our ship A great many lives hang in the balance
I 'm trying Commander Everything 's a blur but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal
Hold course Laredo
Mark 20 Into the black hole areao
Commander Call me Laredo
Let 's do it Tommy
Pedal to the metal
Pedal to the metal Tommy
Practice driving Tommy
Jason What about me What do I do
All right guys Uh Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually Fred you and Guy need to get that air valve back on Alex see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy ca n't get the oxygen back in time
We 've got to get out of here C'mon hurry
NO NO NO
It 's a ROCK It does n't HAVE vulnerable spots
The throat the mouth Its vulnerable spots
It does n't have eyes
Go for the eyes Like in episode 22 with
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard
How about the pig-lizard
Okay On what
Good work Tommy Let 's go
Sorry Guys It just went off
Okay let 's go
Oh right sorry
Tommy we have these
Okay I 'll do this Caw Caw
Anything
What kind of signal
All right Gwen Alex Fred follow me Guy set up the perimeter Tommy you keep a lookout make a signal if they come back
Oh god
Do your best Tommy
Push It Hold it down
Could be this
It 's as far as it goes
Faster Tommy Get us out of here
Just GO GO DAMMIT PUNCH GO
Where
Why do n't you just turn it on and see
Well it 's This was a device we discovered on an alien planet We do n't know what it does either
They designed the ship from watching you So Take her out Lieutenant
Excuse me
I think we 're going to exit the space port
What 's going on
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector I can show you on a map
Wh Where are we
That 's right Just keep shaking it out Here have some gum It helps
And determination
to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies and plenty of them
I did n't say that I said would n't it be great if we could always work together That 's what I said
You said we do appearances together or not at all
Fire at will hI~D NT PROTECTOR
Because they 're coming right at us
WHAT WH
Get oacK on their tail
enerao I 've host them The maanetlsm o the field Is disrupting our onstru ait There they are
Find them
But sir my MEN The core implosion is not reversible
Find them
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort
Lieutenant Lathe I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself Chasing across the universe to obtain what is I am now certain a bauble of fiction Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel I would like nothing to remain
Patience Lt Patience
Continue forward sir
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods probably their whores
I 'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property
What does she see in them
Unfortunately I 'll never get the chance I 'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion Wasting my time naturally Look at her teasing those bumpkins
I wish she was beneath me
Hmmm she 's beneath me I 'm afraid
Well now there 's something worth dying for What do you think
They always say that
Some say that Hessians are invincible
Cut those men down Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial Benedict trust me to handle this
These men were taken from their homes at night tried by Reed 's courts which Congress recognizes and well you can see
You go too far Benedict
They love Reed and his inquisition I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits It 's becoming the American way
Could n't you have appealed to Congress
That scum Joseph Reed they 're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania The man 's a budding Cromwell He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates their property for himself Naturally the pig hates me for every Tory I 've saved
The point being he 's also a candidate for my job If we can pull this off maybe I can restore their faith in me
I 'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed
Have you heard The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee
There then you can have sort of a normal life
As soon as the men have good shelters I 'll move Perhaps Martha will join me this winter
Gates He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he 'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack George why have n't you moved into the Potts house back at the creek Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent And you could entertain I think you need to entertain more Seriously Get a few New Jersey whores up here invite some Congressmen could n't hurt
There 's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga
That ca n't be
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships And that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God Benedict it says that I have gone mad
Same old story
They 're ready Believe me the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything Of course we get nothing from Congress They need boots coats we desperately need food
Exactly We 'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard It would cause the line to buckle Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half
While they 're strung out
Our plan is to hit them as they leave
I You all know my history
Well George who were you
Well truth be told I was a pharmacist Alexander
We 're so damned important Look at us Nathanael you were a horse shoer Benedict before this
After visiting Congress I know what it 's like being violated by come disproportionate asses Ah if she only knew that the most important men in the country possibly the world are sitting at this table
Christ George Joseph Reed 's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you Your own aide
I hope I never have to believe that
Someday George you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is It may come down to us or them someday You or them Cicero was right was is a time when the laws are silent
Then I need you We all do Without your victory the men would have no hope at all
The army can survive without me
The army needs you
Do n't do anything rash please Benedict
What do you think George shall I resign It 's what they want
It is
Is that a fact
Congress is talking openly about replacing you with Lee
Go on I want to hear everything
The man 's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief
We 're in bad shape Benedict moral is low Before I can do anything I need Lee and his seven thousand troops I 've ordered him to join us three times In my last letter I all but begged him to come here The man is insubordinate
But trust you to do what One side in Congress wants compromise another glorious battle some surrender some of course just want power and money But if you do n't mind my asking George what are your plans
They do n't trust me that 's the truth is n't it Sam Adams never did
Oh they have reasons there 's a lot of confusion these days
Why in hell would John do that Why in hell would any of them do that After all you 've done it 's unbelievable
Congress has picked up it 's skirts and is racing for Baltimore They 're not waiting for spring Of course they still had time to deny my promotion Even John Adams voted against it
Damn-it You 've given us a whole new season Benedict And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring Now half their army is back in Canada
I 've come to report that we 've had a bit of luck
Arnold
It comes down to leaders If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe if they go into the forests with the troops eat what they eat fight with them perhaps to die The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation
Ben Franklin 's going to Paris but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns Our troops are mobs they wo n't take orders have no equipment could they beat the British
And a French alliance
They died well Otherwise they did n't do much right But if we have war the British will surely send their best troops right now they have no other enemies
Well you fought with them against the French and Iroquois how good were they then
What 's your frank estimation of the British
Exceedingly Besides if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress I could move a whole army to the moon
You seem pleased by the prospect
Over three hundred miles
You 'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine If we do n't do it the British will come down Champlain take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring
Patience Colonel Arnold Active personalities terrify these men But congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga
We 've got to attack the British Now Have they put you in charge yet Do we have an army yet What is happening
LEE Well general I think I ai n't got no school learning I ai n't got no trade and I 'm a drunk So I think there ai n't much left to be set free
Well what have you thought
LEE I ai n't forgot about the freedom
Wil I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth
You 'd have money every year so you would n't have to work You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want
LEE No I guess
Wil I 'm giving you your freedom Do you understand
LEE Yes general
You 've served me loyally year after year without complaining I 've thought hard about you this past winter I want to free you Wil I want to give you your freedom after this battle is fought
LEE Yes general
Wil
Yes William I am apologizing
LEE Me You apologizing to me
LEE That you would have known you can trust me
What What are you talking about
LEE A lot of years have gone by
Misunderstood what
LEE Well I misunderstood then
None of the servants is to touch a gun You know that
LEE Yes General But if you have to shoot somebody you ca n't
You are never never to touch my guns Do you understand
LEE You you just need a new flint General
Tell Mrs Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer
LEE Colonel sir Mrs Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner
I do n't know what color is what officer my lord
By red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is Colonel
Because they have hardly any uniforms they designate officers with colored ribbons My lord
Negroes Washington has black men in his army Are they good fighters What 's that red ribbon on his arm Colonel
Many of them many did not possess proper arms My lord
And is that a pitchfork beside him
Yes my lord
What sort of boots would you say he 's wearing I should say no sort of boots at all Are n't those rags wrapped around his feet Is that what he marched here in
No my lord
No uniforms No coats even In this weather
Marquis Get these men reformed send Steuben and Wayne out on the left
LEE That 's Greene He 's supporting our reconsolidation
Who is that
What do you know about these men They can stand against anything They 've seen more war than most field generals They are not cowards sir They are not afraid
LEE The British These men can not stand against them
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing
Lafayette will not be happy
LEE I am to take command of Major General Lafayette 's division and lead the attack
LEE More than that sir my orders from Congress
General Lee welcome back I 'm happy you 've decided to join us
You 're asking me to be president of a republic not king Not a dictator over subjects
That 's why the people trust you George Without someone at the convention who has the people behind him everything will fail Will you do it
But it 's more than just that am I right
George you 're the only man the people trust trust with power They know you wo n't betray them
I 'm not sure
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention
Well if it 's my last order then I order them to be there Tell them I will give them my decision then
Yes I believe so
I want to address the officers all the officers Next Friday Can we arrange it at the mess
March on Philadelphia Get Joseph Reed and the pigs in Congress the speculators who 've grown fat off the war Get them all Sweep them aside
What 's your advice Alexander
Is this a coup Alexander are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I do n't agree
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people even if it was against Congress George the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America Listen to me the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne George you must declare yourself with us or against us
To hell with Arnold
George remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold
No one knows
This is a declaration of insurrection Who wrote this
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and can not pay the soldiers pensions
What is this
I am not conscious of it sir But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we part
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect
Sir Arnold is a traitor
Do n't lie to me Hamilton If I had not court-martialed Arnold
Sir I think no such thing
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked You realize what would happen if this fort fell The whole Hudson would be open to them
Yessir
Colonel Hamilton Anyone who served under Arnold I want them shipped north I do n't want any troops here who served under Arnold
General Greene is here There are two other divisions here
Get the body of our army up to Greene 's vanguard as fast as we can All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us
What are we going to do
They go back home to keep their families alive stay into the spring to plant Then they start coming back to us
It 's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter you might as well stop geese from migrating
We better Congress invented him
Are you going to keep him sir
To learn to shoot cannon
I was a clerk 's apprentice on Saint Croix But then I went to King 's College
It 's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for
They 're among the best divisions the British have No conscripts no impressed recruits just professional killers
But it 's what he said just before they killed him I regret that I have but one life to give to my country
That young school teacher I heard the British hung him as a spy
With pleasure and an honor Did you hear about Nathan Hale
Captain I want you to know that I respect your openness It would make me happy if you 'd join our table for dinner from now on
And is that the most horrible thing in the world
General Washington is there actually going to be a compromise I mean a 'deal with England
Well sir then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear
I 'm so inclined
Therefore retreat
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I But if victory is remote and there 's any hope for a negotiated peace we must keep this army intact
Excuse me General but may I ask how do you feel
Delighted sir
I 'll expect you for dinner this evening Captain Hamilton For Christ 's sake have a bath
I 'll be twenty next year sir
How old are you Captain
Then use rocks
We 've got powder but no ball
Hamilton you 're going to have to cover our asses as we cross
Captain Alexander Hamilton sir
GATES George we 've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army
Who the hell knows Everyone 's giving orders It 's all very democratic
GATES Who 's in command out there
The last I heard a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed 's hill With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it
GATES Good day Mister Adams George what 's the word from Boston
Horatio Horatio Gates of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went
ADAMS They are friends of Congress
Of course the army will acquit him that 's not the point Arnold is a man and will understand What I need to understand is John Sam what is happening here Who are those people in there The fat ones in silk
ADAMS George I 'm sorry We all know the army will acquit Arnold
Lafayette is my friend He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind so of course he 's a child But he would have died before he would have let me down
ADAMS Lafayette is a child
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them Unlike General Lee who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief
ADAMS Colonel Charles Lee Hounds and all Quite the character He 's got a tremendous reputation
I do n't know delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things And if he 's popular with his men
ADAMS You wo n't be needing his largess Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment
As does your ability Horatio We must talk further when it 's more convenient
ADAMS With your support Horatio As one of our own who has seen combat with the British your opinion counts
ADAMS Yes an astonishing power over weak minds
Well John Adams your cousin has a marvelous gift
ADAMS It 's the political 'cost of doing business George
ADAMS Partially
ADAMS Again just to touch on a touchy subject but would the people accept another leader over Washington
ADAMS Finally It 's people like these who as soon as they get a little power want more and more More ale here
ADAMS No one wants another failure right now God knows But people like Arnold and God knows I 'm having my fears about General Washington
ADAMS He has the soul of an aristocrat who 'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people
ADAMS You think that
ADAMS You invented this this
ADAMS Oh come now
ADAMS Gag on your own invention then
ADAMS Makes you gag
ADAMS I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored General Washington Champion of Trenton Savior of the Republic And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress
ADAMS Let 's not over do it
ADAMS Hancock led the Boston 'tea party because he 's a goddamned tea smuggler He was n't protesting inequality he was eliminating competition Now you listen to me we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief or the south will not fight What have we been struggling for all these years For this moment And if we fail now remember you stopped us
ADAMS He 's from Virginia there is no more classist elitist English place on earth than Virginia And what in hell has he done for our cause Washington has been preaching compromise compromise compromise Hancock acts he led the Boston Tea party That 's why New England loves him
ADAMS Washington is perfect He 's a Southerner he 's a war hero and he 's rich
GREENE What 's the difference
REED Unofficially General Greene
GREENE We already have black soldiers in our army
REED Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army
GREENE The British Army is right back there across that river Sir I think it must be something else that detains General Lee
REED The British army sir
GREENE Detained by what
REED General Lee is detained captain
GREENE I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York why wo n't he come on
REED No officer is going to get these men to fight They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island At the most perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost then retire to protect Congress
GREENE These men have suffered but I believe they will fight
REED Did God ever make such a pitiful army
REED If he is n't then he 's stupid
GREENE I doubt Arnold will be afraid
Are you all going insane Benedict Arnold The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain Who carried the day at Saratoga Goddamn-it Joseph you own two mansions ride in an expensive Tory coach You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs
REED Well I shall deny him to you He is evil on earth
Arnold is indispensable do you understand I need Arnold to help me win this war
How can you say that
REED The man is a traitor
Gentlemen let me get to the point I ca n't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold
Joseph are you afraid to cross that river with me I accept your resignation With regret You have leave to return to Philadelphia
REED Understand You need to be listening to people like John Adams and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind
They help me understand why we fight
REED And Hamilton Greene
How many generals do we have like Arnold He 's got guts he 's vain and he fights
REED George I 'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide I see where we 're headed you 're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold
They are also very religious So we will attack them three days from now on Christmas One force under me and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader
REED But the Hessians are there No one can beat them That 's why Cornwallis stationed them there They have the post of honor They are invincible
REED No I did not Really Well what the hell is a deist precisely
I mean I 'm a Deist A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin Surely you knew that
REED What do you mean you 're not a Christian Of course you 're a Christian we 're all Christians
REED To assert the rights of our founding fathers This country was colonized by Christians This shall become a Christian revolution Surely as a good Christian you understand that
No As a matter of fact I have n't the slightest idea what you 're talking about
REED A ground swell-Christian movement George you see
A grand scheme
REED Well George Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property I would n't cast my fate with that man
Joseph the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges In my opinion he saved my army
REED That damned Arnold is here is n't he Did you know he lost all his ships Outrageous and completely unacceptable
REED George So good to be back
Colonel Reed
REED I understand George
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now we have to hold on here our men must believe they can win the British must believe that somehow in some mad impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them
REED What can he do The British have massive superiority
My God They mean to finish us What about Arnold He 's up there
A fleet
REED Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain
Any word from Canada
I will continue with our French allies concentrating on New York
I feel the same sir
Get these men back in line
General Lee sir
My God Who ordered this retreat
My baby daughter has died my baby mon petite Henriette
What is it Marquis
When the snow melts mon petite Marquis I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers
Like flowers after the snow melts
Yes I will write him and tell his ministers and the court
Because if the British got off their asses and came up here now we would be smashed And the revolution would be finished Tell King Louis it 's that bad
Chose another Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses
I rode here on my horse
Well we will accept these charming little gifts When we see them Meanwhile please take your pick of a horse
Sir these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville They are a gift from the people of France
And how rusty are these muskets
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets
These supplies
I only meant
'Charming little victories Please do n't expect much more of us Monsieur
I am Then I understand you too serve without salary You know since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton the French court is softening I expect any time now a ship load of supplies
You must be very rich
Mon General I have come here to learn and to give not to take I am serving without salary
No please an advance on your salary
The one with 'Philadelphia spelled correctly is the counterfeit
I they look both the same
'Continentals Congress paper money It was worthless to start with but as you see counter feiters have made them even less than worthless Can you tell which one is fake
Uh none just now but
Gentlemen my I introduce a French gentleman recently appointed major general by Congress Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier Marquis de Lafayette General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen and how many cases of muskets Mon petite Marquis
What I want to know is sir where is your daddy
Sir please accept my commission from Congress and You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife Adrienne we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left Her name is Henriette
But general I assure you my motives are sincere
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with
However through my relations with members of his majesty 's court I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England Vive la France Vive l'Amerique
I do n't want to see your hospital
I want you to see our hospital
Not today
Come out and meet my soldiers They 're good people
Leave me now sir I am tired
Martha For God 's sake
Well we must keep in mind the Dower Laws One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding it would be legally impossible to distinguish them
Our 'kind What is that supposed to mean These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight They desire it They seek it Of course Virginia is terrified For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class from the face of the earth Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free If we win this war they will own this country too
Do n't condescend to me We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men It 's damned condescending
Some things must never change
What 's the point of a revolution if it does n't
Oh indeed You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes They beg you to consider the future What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish
To win this war I need an army
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army There 's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests
Martha what
Well I would n't want to trouble you with this now
What else From Virginia
It 's an anti-Christian dogma I can not believe you are so calm about it
I think I heard that
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church
And have you heard anything from our dear friend Sally What with all the rumors getting back to England I thought she might inquire after us But then I believe she always looked down on us
That 's right
That 's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven Devotion to country duty purity of heart Purity of heart I was drunk on something then
When you lived with the Fairfaxes
Liberty Virtue Country That 's from Cato you know that play about the noble Romans As I was riding up to Philadelphia I found myself thinking about the old days
You 're no fool George You never have been
But as usual it will not go well for them Martha you must trust me
Everything If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands and that would be a boon for our family We already have more slaves than we need but we need more land
And what 'prize do you see What could we possible gain
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I 'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he 's crazy Believe me this 'disturbance is n't going to last long You have to understand congress is a chicken coop full of foxes Martha each and every one has his eye on a nice fat prize
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say If he had his way all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory
Do n't be ridiculous of course that wo n't happen
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated to be destroyed
I 'm very aware of that
Well a very real expectation is the British will hang you They 'll burn Mount Vernon and they 'll hang you Our marriage is a business just as surely as
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised my dear a classless world Not a very real expectation
My God what
Of course if it were that simple These people They 're after something else
But to go to war over trade over money Surely there 's still time for a compromise
Our beloved father the King also refuses to bend
War No I did not When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable There 's no middle ground at all We 're the King 's children
Surely you knew this was coming
My God these people mean to go to war They really mean it
It 's another demonstration against the king This is the wildest yet
You know I came back to Mount Vernon to retire I do n't need to be in government
GREENE If the constitution is ratified we 'll have a country They 'll want to elect you president of the convention which means president of the country
GREENE It is we need you George
Well this must be about something
GREENE Yes sir it 's a wise idea
They 're for my bodyguard I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me do n't you think
GREENE Sir I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform
GREENE I 'm honored but reluctant to leave you
Nathanael I 'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army to harass Cornwallis Marquis you must go with him
You 've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in It 's all right boys I 'm here
GREENE What the hell are we doing
GREENE Then maybe I do see what you 're after perhaps you get to chose again
At one time I could have chosen not to be
GREENE But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner Sir
I will not betray you Nathanael
GREENE No We 're all of us after something It 's easy for me to fight for the common man My father could only dream that I would be a general someday And what of my daughter or son I know what I 'm after But now with all this talk about compromise It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope
You do n't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism
GREENE Sir if you do n't mind my saying I do n't understand your history at all I mean why would you want to win the war You 're not after glory like Benedict You 're a slave owner and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army
You have a free tongue Captain Hamilton
GREENE They 're just disgusting jealous bottom-feeding swine It 's their nature
Yes I thought that 's how you 'd feel Nathanael
GREENE I 'm with Captain Hamilton
General Greene
GREENE You wrong me general I am an officer and a horse-shoer
I certainly did n't mean you Of course you are a gentleman an officer and a gentleman
GREENE Well sir I was an ironmaster before you got me Maybe I will let you down yet
Nathanael someone bred to station bred to being a gentleman unlike these men his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs
GREENE Sir Congress has n't issued their pay for two months many have not eaten properly for at least that long You 're being a little hard on them do n't you think
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them Fifty lashes each
GREENE Yes but I 've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history And I read the lives of Caesar Alexander Hannibal Sir I 'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army
A horseshoer
GREENE I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now My father is an ironmaster As was I
But you do come from a military family
GREENE I was born with a limp sir The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway
It is n't my army yet Colonel Greene Looks like you 've seen some action did you hurt your leg in a fight
GREENE I I 'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army sir
Yes yes happy to meet you
GREENE Colonel Washington Colonel Nathanael Greene Rhode Island Militia
GREENE Yessir
They 're finished they ca n't help us anymore They 've done their duty General Greene now you do yours
GREENE We 're leaving them
We ca n't take them Are you all right
Mankind is born free but everywhere he is in chains
Really Which precious homily was it
Well I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements but which I now see means us all
I remember a pair of young philosophers once who laughed at the world
You remember George when we were 'studying the great philosophers
I 'd throw everything away for you
Now that is a lie See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis I 'll divorce William Do you hear You get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love
Perhaps you 've been counting my acres Mrs Fairfax and discovered exactly how poor I really am
Is it William says now you have requested a British Commission why not colonial I 'll clear it up for you sir because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels more than that it will even get you into polite society Your dream come true George the only dream that really matters to you
That 's a lie
And what is this then Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot Or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war
But not more than your comfort
George you know I only love you but
Is that the truth Well we ca n't carry on like animals any longer
You know very well who it is that I love
Well the widow Curtis will bring you riches position land even half-grown children You wo n't have to do anything at all You sha n't have to do another thing to prove yourself
Words words words Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies is n't that right
Think what the play means William Perhaps these words have a place in the real world
Hear that George Sally 's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home And it 's her first tour We 're gratified are n't we George
Except for that quite like home England that is
We can grow three primary crops in a season and if we have some luck we get a forth The temperature is generally mild
That 's not what I said Now Sally you 're embarrassing me Watch out for her George she talks refinement but she has a barbarous soul
Oh but you must not mind my talking about you In fact William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest English gentleman out of you
George I 'm sorry
So you are William 's wild young neighbor Or should I say 'brother William claims you as a member of his family I have heard so many unflattering tales about you and I understand that except for you this 'family is quite cultivated
Voltaire of course
WASHINGTON That 's good who
Remember George It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong
And dost thou live to ask it
WASHINGTON I 'm lost in ecstasy And dost thou love Thou charming maid
I 've been surprised in an unguarded hour But must not now go back the love that lay Half smothered in my breast has broke through all Its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre I can not if I would conceal it from thee
Those people I doubt they 'd think of this Ooo you 're wonderful this color
WASHINGTON They can use their imaginations
Why Juba was an African and you want to look the part hold still
WASHINGTON You 're out of your mind
Let 's get you darker
WASHINGTON What are you doing
WASHINGTON I think I will disappoint you
I do n't laugh at you George I like you I like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat and that 's because you 're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings
WASHINGTON What else should I become There 's no difference between Virginia and England I must be educated if I 'm to take my place in society My father could n't afford to send me to England for school he made a shambles of our fortunes Everyone laughs at me
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them
WASHINGTON Well we must be who we must be
Is it Well I 'm scared of what we 've become in our freedom
WASHINGTON It 's the freest land on earth
Do you When I saw those men yesterday in the field and the women and children in those hovels I 'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I 'd hoped
WASHINGTON I think America suits you
The place to want to be is America Every English child dreams of it I dreamt it
WASHINGTON I always though London was the place to be capital of the world the most spectacular city on earth
Perhaps you best ask why you wish it You asked William to teach you manners philosophy decorum as I said it 's completely stupid
WASHINGTON Then why are you teaching me
It 's stupid of course
WASHINGTON What do you really think of the minuet anyway
That 's just my interpretation Actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners You see Walk in a gently Z There are four distinct movements
WASHINGTON Cranes Who needs to walk like a crane
In the minuet George every movement is significant like the strut of cranes
WASHINGTON Or 'civilized
The word 'minuet finds its source in minitus which is Latin meaning 'small or 'orderly
WASHINGTON Sally our slave system is a British law
Capture them Well I 've never seen anything like it so of course I 'm curious
WASHINGTON Slavers capture them and bring them here
Africa That 's so far How do they get here
WASHINGTON Africa of course
Where do those men come from George
God damn you Sam Adams You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we 've really got one it scares you more than it does the British
ADAMS Is that your test of patriotism George if a man will die for you
ADAMS Well I hear 'The People Indentured servants freed slaves escaped slaves The world 's castaways And my fear is in the scramble for power that 's coming you will betray them
That I hear a mob unemployed drunkards vagabonds the world 's dregs
ADAMS You hear that
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war You know why I do n't trust revolutions Because each of us is who we are we make speeches print pamphlets and we never change The world is not a philosophical abstraction Mister Adams it 's us And I do n't believe you can ever change human nature
ADAMS And 'others say have you even read Locke Vattel Voltaire Diderot
I see
ADAMS I say
Who says so
ADAMS Yes
Just because they are born
ADAMS All people have rights
That land belongs to the strongest
ADAMS You are a slave owner You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley That land belongs to the natives
Do n't be silly you have whole worlds to fathom
WASHINGTON William we 've been studying hard I really know my stuff
He was not black He was tan Weathered
WASHINGTON Juba was a Numidian
For God sake get that horrid stuff off your face You look like a damned slave It 's damned humiliating
WASHINGTON This this is life indeed Life worth preserving Such life as Juba never felt till now
My daughter I ask only
WASHINGTON Though sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season
The land here is best for grain and corn
Hey you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles
You 're kidding me right

What the setup did n't work so you want the key back
I have to ask you for that key
What did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in
You spotted them huh
You think I 'd be standing here You set somebody up and you want it to work it has to be a surprise Can you remember that
So you did n't have the key with you
I do n't know how I could 've missed you with that shirt on It 's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color Right

Alright Bo You can have the money but it 's not here I have to go get it

Karen You okay

CATLETT How 'bout I give you to three then I organize your fuckin brains all over the wall back there One
CATLETT Tell you what
I ca n't believe the way you guys do business out here I ca n't believe how fucked up your organization is
Lem me see if I got this right you break into Karen Flores house ask me for three hundred grand does n't even belong to you
CATLETT The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo
What money
CATLETT I need the money
Yeah well we need a ride somewhere we 'll let you know
CATLETT I really think I can be of service on this one
CATLETT That 's all
That 's all there is to it huh
CATLETT There 's nothin to know You have an idea you write down what you wan na say Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong if you are n't positive yourself Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words although I 've seen scripts where I know words were n't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all So I do n't think it 's too important Anyway you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out and that 's the end you 're done
You know how to write one of these
She 's been out of movies a few years but she 's good Real good
CATLETT Who
Yeah I read it I was just thinking you could make her older We might even be able to get Karen Flores
CATLETT Young She 's fuckin nine-years-old same age as Lovejoy 's kid Bernie One she calls Bernard Have you read the script
She 's young
CATLETT With Ilona You know how old Ilona is
Get something going there
CATLETT What about her
There 's Ilona
CATLETT I 'm with you on that And do n't you think it needs a good female part Increase the romance angle
Title 's the first thing 's got to go And the guy 's name I mean even this writer 's name Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy
CATLETT So what Where 's it say in this script he 's white Color is what the part needs man somebody to do it has some style The way it is now Ronnie could do it play himself some cracked out asshole So whatta you think of the script
Yeah Morgan Freeman But he 's a colored guy
CATLETT I missed that one Or hey you know who else Morgan Freeman You know Morgan
Harvey Keitel Yeah Maybe He was pretty good in the movie Fingers
CATLETT I wonder would that work You know who I see for Al Roxy Harvey Keitel The man could do it in his sleep
I put a gun right here and I tell him 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin dead Like that
CATLETT No shit come on How you gon na do that
Yeah we 're getting Martin
CATLETT Says here you 're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy
That 's right me
CATLETT You must bring something heavy to the deal
It 's what he said I 'm his associate
CATLETT Harry called you his associate but what does that mean I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace
I 'd never make you as a burglar not in that outfit
CATLETT I 'm just explaining to you what I 'm doing here Case you think I come to rob the place rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has
That 's funny I was just wondering what I was gon na break of yours to get it away from you
CATLETT You understand I knew Harry was lying saying this was n't any good but holding on to it man like you have to break his fingers to get it from him
That 's what I thought So let me put it this way
CATLETT You can talk to me
But first I want to know who I 'm talking to Am I talking to you or am I talking to him
Harry let me answer that
CATLETT What 's this movie you 're doing first
CATLETT That 's the magic number
C-18
CATLETT It 's not the kind of thing you do
I do n't know
CATLETT It was waiting out there on another deal one that did n't go through one you do n't want to know about
The airport
CATLETT Whenever you want it The money 's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags you know In a locker at the airport waiting to be picked up
Assuming I go along with this when can I have the five hundred
Leo I do n't know
CATLETT He was watching Letterman huh Sneaky that Chili Palmer So he ever find this dry cleaner the one with all that money on him
CATLETT We 'll talk about that Harry But first I got ta know how 'd you hook up with Chili Palmer
You 're gon na just give me five hundred grand
CATLETT How 'bout another one for Mr Zimm A double
CATLETT All I want in return is to work on the movie with you Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up
You serious
CATLETT Listen Harry how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand You pay me back at your convenience no interest
CATLETT Yeah I was wondering why he should do that
Chili Palmer showed you my script
CATLETT Last night When he called me over to your office to talk about it
Boy this town Word gets around does n't it
CATLETT Yeah I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr Lovejoy
I 'm working on a few things
CATLETT You must be makin some big deals doin lunch in a place like this
Bo I 'm great Listen I 'm expecting some people 
It 's a different kind of deal
CATLETT You positive about that
I ca n't do it
CATLETT Harry you think we go to see your movies I 've seen better film on teeth Makes no difference to me which one our money 's in So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks and put 'em in this other one Mr Loverboy
CATLETT What I 'm sayin is the man wants his money and he wants it now
I 'm already in town but it do n't matter We got dick in the bank We dumped it all in Harry 's movie
CATLETT You get to town you go straight to the bank raid the limo account
By Friday man or you 're fuckin dead as disco
CATLETT Okay Then be good enough to hand us our money back or you think about us coming in on this new one

Or else what
Hey Zimm does n't ask for dick Zimm tells you the way it is or else
So what this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee that what we 're talking about here
Maybe that 's because you 've never been out 've fuckin Miami dipshit Maybe it 's time you got on a plane flew out to L.A and took a meeting with Mr Zimm
Never heard of him
Harry Zimm The man happens to be a major Hollywood player
Who

What 've you got
Hey Chil Since you 're goin out to L.A anyway
Apparently way it went he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush My guess he 's by his lonesome at the track right now
Leo spanked a waitress
Anyway you want this guy he 's in L.A We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room
Do n't waste your time Harry The guy 's not much of a movie fan Now c'mon gim me the key
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself See if he wants to invest in my movie

Who the fuck is Momo Jesus these fucking names

Is he giving you a check or cash
Get the fuck outta my chair
Here 's your keys Harry
Yeah Chili Hi You 're fifty feet in the air
Hey Harry
How 's anyone gon na see anything from way up there
His shrink 's trainer
That 's the difference between you and me Harry I say what I mean I want something from someone I ask 'em straight out I want Martin Weir I go get Martin Weir I do n't fuck around with his trainer 's shrink
I said I 'd think about it What does that mean In this town nothing
You tell me you want these guys off your back Next thing I know you 're saying yeah maybe they can have a piece of Mr Lovejoy I could n't believe my fuckin ears
Never say anything unless you have to
I had to tell 'em something
I do n't know maybe I was n't clear But I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
What
You 're kidding right
You do n't say any more n you have to You say 'Well I 'm glad you assholes stopped by so I can set you straight
That 's right they 're wondering who 's this guy You do n't tell 'em Understand Harry Do not tell 'em who I am
They 'll be looking at you They do n't know who you are
No leave 'em up we want the light in their eyes I 'll be at the desk but do n't introduce me let it go just start talking You 're gon na be here behind 'em when they sit down
Read it It 's a grabber
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel watching the bar across the street getting his video camera ready for action What 's he doing Following a guy
Let 's see how we get along
What do you get out of this
Harry I probably know 'em better than you do
You do n't even know these guys
But I could talk to the limo guys Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while Make the point in a way they 'd understand it
Just a thought
I 'm not gon na pop her Harry
That or I 'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin 
So you 're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie
Doris Murray 's widow finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract she wants five hundred grand for the script
Heart attack Apparently they brought a couple hookers along
He drown
The problem is Murray He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago Murray never made it back
So what 's the problem
Anyway Murray has this shrink who also happens to be Martin 's personal trainer 's shrink Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin 's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out and Martin flips Loves it
She 's a rock star Every day same time they come down here and have breakfast He has the egg white omelet she has the banana pancakes He sits facing west so he can see his billboard She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades
She looks familiar
Ride the Clouds Good picture
No his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt Whitney
One of his best parts
Martin Weir He played the mob guy that turned snitch in The Cyclone
Two time academy award nominee Martin Weir
Who 's the star
Murray Saffrin guy who wrote it did all my Grotesque pictures had it in a drawer for twenty years He shows it to me one day tells me he 's got a star interested would I produce it
It 's not bad when you know what it 's about
Mr Lovejoy That 's the title
Mr Lovejoy
What 's it called
A blockbuster But quality No mutants or maniacs This one 's gon na be my Driving Miss Daisy
For a movie
Because I need half a million to buy a script
You got that on the brain Harry If you 're so scared of 'em why 'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with
Because they 're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint The first thing they 'd do is break my legs
You 're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid and that 's hard to do Let 's just get to where you 're at okay You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you have n't told 'em about it Why not
Harry look at me
These guys my investors they run a limo service came to me originally put money in a few of my pictures and did okay they 're happy So they come in on another deal  this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake The characters there 's this seven hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys gets them in her trailer 
Racketeering that covers a lot of ground does n't it
I 've been picked up a couple times Loan sharking Racketeering But I was never convicted I 'm clean
Really You ever been arrested
Once
Ever shot anybody
Maybe a few times I have
What does that mean
Not really
You pack a gun
They always paid
I imagine in your line of work there were times you had to get rough you know say one of your customers stopped paying
What I did till recently After I get done here I 'll think about what I 'm gon na do next
Is that right that 's what you do for a living
So you do n't work for the casino
I 'm out here looking for Leo I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend Dick Allen
But you work for the casino
I 'm not the guy Harry
You would n't be talking to me if you were
You mean Leo
Wait a minute you 're not the guy are you The dry cleaner
Part of it yeah
The shylock He 's barely mentioned And it 's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast
The shylock 's the good guy
That 's half a movie with holes in it Maybe forty minutes of screen time You do n't even have a girl a female lead and on top of that there 's no one to sympathize with you do n't have a good guy
I said I had an idea that 's all
That 's it That 's your movie
I do n't know about his wanting to meet celebrities that 's something new But yeah he comes to L.A Then after that I do n't know what happens
So he comes to L.A
Well since Leo 's name was on the passenger list
Keep going
That 's right As a matter of fact
Without him The guy 's so out of it he does n't even know it 's gone
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken You have to understand the loan shark 's in business the same as anybody else He is n't in it to hurt people He 's in it to make money
It 's the kind of situation you do n't pay you get your legs broken
I mean the way you told it to me Start at the beginning we see how the story line develops
You just did
You want to hear this idea It 's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand Go on tell her
Karen it 's a pleasure How you doing
Karen say hello to Chili Palmer Chili this is Karen Flores
I produce feature motion pictures no TV You mentioned Grotesque that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen
You make movies huh
Fuckin basketball game
Come on Harry  Mesas The worst they might do is get a judgment against you uttering a bad check I ca n't imagine you want that to happen man in your position
You gon na get rough now threaten me I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken
I want you to
Why do I have to keep looking at you
You 're not looking at me Harry
They do n't want to deposit yours and have it bounce That annoys them So your dear friend Dick Allen 's been calling leaving messages on your machine but you never get back to him I happen to be in Vegas on another matter and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up I follow you over here see you in the window with this woman looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores was in Grotesque except she 's not blond anymore
I know what a marker is
A marker 's like a check Harry
Harry lem me give you some advice
Operator how do I get Las Vegas Information
We 're there Harry You signed markers for a hundred and a half you 're over sixty days past due and you have n't told anybody what the problem is
Dick Allen 's a very dear friend of mine How far you want to go with this
You know Dick Allen Mesa 's Casino
That 's what I 'm doing
I want you to keep looking right here okay
I 'm looking at you
You look okay to me Harry Come over here and sit down Tell me what you been up to

We just did I told you my name 's Chili Palmer

Where you been Harry
Jesus if I have a heart attack I hope you know what to do
BONES Exactly You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket I do n't give a fuck You do n't ever hand me a book with a miss in it

Hey it 's your book now You want to check it out go ahead He 's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway

Yeah I like it I 'm high up I can see everything you know It 's the Cadillac of minivans
Very nice
Buddy
Lem me talk to Buddy set up a meeting
You 're not going to tell me the rest
At that point basically that has to be it
Okay I 'm listening
It 's not that simple You have to be careful There 's another guy that comes along a hard-on you owe some money to A mob guy Wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look
Good-looking too Like Karen
The wife sues the airline This is a gutsy babe
How do I know that
Yeah but you have n't found him yet The guy took off for Las Vegas
I turn it on when I confront the guy
I believe it
That 's what I think of you asshole Nothing
That 's not bad
How about this
Now you 're squinting like you need glasses
Wait How about this
What you 're telling me you 're tired You wan na go to bed
Like this
No I want you to look at me the way I 'm looking at you Put it in your eyes 'You 're mine asshole without saying it
I 'm looking at you
Martin look at me
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off I go after him The fuck you think I do
Pressure I 'm the one applied the pressure
What happened The pressure got to you
Martin I 'm not connected to those people anymore Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami
With what Wiseguy money
One we 're producing
One of mine
I 'm thinking of a movie
If you 'd like to tell me yeah
So you want to know
No I do n't Though I have to say I 'm curious
So you do n't know what I 'm thinking
Yeah Kinda Anyway once I have the authentic sounds of speech the rhythms man the patois I can actually begin to think the way those guys do get inside their heads
You mean like we do n't give a shit
It 's more like your attitude Your tone your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves in your opinions your indifference to conventional views
We talk different
A few weeks before shooting I went back to Bensonhurst just to listen to you guys See I 'm Italian but I grew up in Tarzana So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech
Well you had it down cold Watching you in the movie if I did n't know better I 'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting Even the fink part I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do but how you did it must be the way finks act
Martin It was a beautiful role All I had to do was find the character 's center the stem I 'd used to wind him up and he 'd play man he 'd play
You know Marty you were good in The Cyclone
Yeah That was a good party
I 'll find you Leo
But you wo n't know where I am I do n't even know where I 'll be
At eighteen percent okay And do n't ask me no more fuckin questions I 'm leaving
You take all my money but you 're borrowing part of it
Sit down Leo
It 's all mine
You can keep what you won today That 's yours
How By taking my money
I would n't let her if she tried Why I 'm here Leo basically is to save your ass
It was Fay was n't it told you about the money She tell you my whole life history for Christ 's sake
Here 's another tip
How 'd you know I was here
Now you 're down to three-ten in the case You must 've cooled off quite a bit since you got here
Who told you that
From when You left Vegas with four fifty
I 'm up twelve grand today
You 've been losing
You do n't open an account Leo you put it in a safe deposit box Dip in whenever you want
They report it to the IRS
You 're here a while what 's wrong with a bank
I did n't know where else to keep it Where would you
I would n't think you 're that dumb leave over three hundred grand in the closet underneath the extra blanket but I guess you are
I know who he works for Where 's your phone
Mr Barboni is a good customer Works for Jimmy Capp
Lem me get this straight You are n't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine but you 're gon na find Ray Bones coat or get him a new one Is that what you 're telling me
We call you a taxi
Maybe you do n't see my sign
You see a black leather jacket fingertip length like the one Pacino wore in Serpico You do n't you owe me three seventy-nine
It 's not one of these
Could n't find my toothbrush
What took you so long
Go get your stuff
I 'll be right back
I was scared then not now How long you want me to be scared
You do n't act like it
You bet
Were you scared up there
Oh shit I 'm sorry I thought that was I 'm so sorry
Karen What the fuck are you doing
Guy 's got a fucking pink toilet for Christ 's sake
You okay
I 'll go I 'll go
You 're as bad as Harry
I do n't know
Are you going down
It 's not Dave It 's a movie
He 's doing the same thing you did to him playing Letterman on TV
You sure
Yeah Harry you look like you belong in one of your horror movies
Harry what 're you doing You 're supposed to be in the hospital
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu They have to think of something they have to have that is n't on the menu
Why not
Continental but it does n't matter Martin wo n't order from the menu
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway
What happened
Harry My God
Hey Chili Look at me
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie play a hard-on But I could n't see myself in ones like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby They do n't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute 
Whichever Let 's talk about it tomorrow
You do n't mean a movie star More like a character actor
Oh
No I do n't mean that I just meant in general
You thought I was faking
I think you could be an actor I know you 're acting sometimes but you do n't show it
Really
Yeah There 's a girl in it now
Yeah
That 's a different story I 'm still working on that one you know getting the visual fabric just right Although I 've added to it
How 'bout Chili 's Hollywood Adventure
How 'bout Get Shorty Except that is n't a movie That 's real life
So what about your story You thought of a title yet
For starters Marty was n't Martin back then
Oh I like him I just think he 's short I mean he 's a good actor and all but I 'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty
You do n't like Martin much do you
I do n't know I 'm just havin some trouble seeing you two together
Not unlike the way Nicki met him Except it was a wrap party Why
How 'd you meet Martin anyway
Definitely not Martin Movie stars never pick up the check They have no idea what things cost Most of them do n't know their zip code and a lot do n't even know their own phone number
Depends who pays
That was Martin He wants to have lunch tomorrow That is if you can make it
The guy 's setting you up You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he 's paying you back
A locker at the airport Jesus Christ Harry Tell me you 're not really that stupid
Yeah We understand you read the script and like it a lot
Well actually Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr Lovejoy
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant
This thing 's actually accurate I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset
Yeah well I like movies I figure if I help Harry make one I 'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money That does n't sound too hard I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time
And you think the movie business is any different
I was never much into it All that bullshit having to do with respect It 's bad enough having to treat those guys like they 're your heroes having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think 's real funny
Yesterday you were a loan shark
Why does anyone want to be in movies
I want to know
That why you came over here to ask me that
What do you get out of it
Sounds fair
I do n't want to act in it I want to produce it with Harry Especially if I help him get Martin
There a part in it for you
You and Harry 'll make a great team I 'm gon na make a deal with him
Not yet
Then you 've read it
I do n't like the title Or the main guy 's name
I think it 's not horrible
What do you think
I already read it Harry left a copy at the house
I got you a copy of the script
I just caught the end
You been here the whole time
Yeah Right Listen Touch of Evil 's playing near my hotel You wan na go check it out Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican
Right See how your story ends
Well I got ta have a talk with Leo my runaway dry cleaner
Do n't go out of your way
Tell you what I 'll stop by Harry 's office and pick up a copy for you
Yeah well Martin is known for his flipping He flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out
Harry told me Martin loves it he flipped
Harry 's dreaming of a forty-million dollar production he 'll never get off the ground with a star he 'll never sign With or without my help
That why Harry came over last night See if you could help him get Martin in his movie
He must mean after Slime Creature 3
You read Harry 's new one He says it 's the best thing he 's ever read
I married Martin That was a full time job
How come you stopped making movies with Harry
Yeah you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch gives him a flirty look and says I 'd kiss you but
Cotton
Yeah It 's a real gift I 'm just saying it 'd be nice one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line You know like in that Bette Davis picture Cabin in the
Man can you scream
I know I 'm better than what I 've been doing the last ten years walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps waiting till it 's time to scream
For any movie
Yeah that was a good scene I mean for a horror movie
Yeah When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished when you give us all that look Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence Not even in Mildred Pierce  which by the way was a better book than a movie  did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look
You saw that one
Like in Bride of the Mutant when you played the whole end with that torn top
That 's what we finally decided
Ripped nylons work Makes the shot more real
I spent all day crawling out of a grave The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons 
Rough day on the set
Yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out
No no you left the patio door open You got ta stop doin that all the nice things you got around here
Lem me get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before
I wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like I did last night
What 're you doing here
Hey Karen How ya doin
How much is the wife offered
A couple days ago by people from the airliner come to see his wife tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement the amount based on what he would 've earned operating the dry cleaner 's the rest of his life Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys so they were giving him about ten years
A real bargain
A hundred and fifty-six Some 'll charge you more n that go as high as six for five on a short-term loan So three a week 's not too bad
But a week That 's a hundred and fifty percent a year
That 's right Three percent
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand
I know what a vig is
Well basically this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand plus he 's a few weeks behind on the vig the interest you have to pay
What if it was
No it was open It was n't locked
You broke in
The door from the patio in back
Hey Chil I think you 're fulla shit
I do n't think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer
How you gon na do that You do n't know shit about making movies
I 'm thinking about producing
What 're you talking about You wan na be a movie star
I 'm going into the movie business
Whatta you doing out there
Yeah well I 'm in L.A now
He already knew it
How 'd he know I was in Vegas You tell him
All I know is he came by the barber shop all fuckin undone wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas I told him I do n't know I still do n't
You gon na start that again You 're just like him all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin thing
No you just broke his fuckin nose instead
You said do n't say nothing and I did n't
I hate to say I told you but I did I told you do n't start nothing with him that time
Do n't say a fuckin word
I told you not to 
In an armchair Or I go to a coffee shop sleep there Sit in a booth pull my hat down
That 's the dumbest thing I ever heard Where do you sleep
No I said I 'm never goin to bed There 's a difference See the article says most people die in their beds I figure long as I stay outta bed I 'm safe
Do n't worry about it I wo n't say any more than I have to if that
Hey Chili Get your coat but do n't piss the guy off okay It could get complicated and we 'd have to call Momo to straighten it out Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we do n't need that
Tomorrow I see on the TV weather it 's gon na be nice and warm You wo n't need the coat
That 's what the guy said
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat
What 's Momo gon na want with an old place shows old movies people do n't care about no more Outside of maybe turnin it into a porno house I do n't think he 's gon na give much of a fuck And you already got a job
Momo could buy it I could run it for him Show some Cagney films
What I 'm thinkin is maybe Momo could buy it
Yeah the guy owes Momo a few G 's
They 're closing the Granview You know theater down on Biscayne
What she did not say was I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin seasick All she cared about was that look All she remembered was that look And why do we remember things in movies Because we can see them
That 's great Harry So what 's the
So Mildred says to the cashier I saw the new Streisand picture 'God I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford 's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other but knew they could n't be together That look was so romantic
You heard me Pick n Save
Hm
Pick n Save
Yeah What three words Harry
She 's scared Fear is an emotion Look kid if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm let it be the three key words to filmmaking
What 'emotion Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gon na distance us from the emotion of the scene
Get down here I wan na talk to you Come on right now She 's gon na talk to Martin
Whatta you mean whose point of view The audience 's point of view
Yeah but whose point of view
How honorable of you
He said if Martin 's interested I could get a half a million for it easy But do n't worry Harry I 'm still giving you until Friday
Yeah what 'd he have to say
No But now that you mention it I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day who just happened to get his hands on the script
So this means you 've reconsidered our deal on Mr Lovejoy
Murray 's dead
I mean morally Murray was my friend
You seem to feel fine about it
I 'm not sure how I feel about this Doris
What he was was a hack could n't get a job writing for anybody but you I 'm being honest He was a lousy writer but he was a good husband I just did n't know it until too late
Yeah me too He was a helluva good writer And I would know I discovered him Made him what he was
I miss Murray Harry
Yeah lovely Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there What do you want Doris
What a spectacular view
Come on in
Well are n't you gon na offer me whatever it is you taste like
Harry Zimm You look like a wet kiss
Hello Doris
Man 's in town two days thinks he 's David O fucking Selznick
Harry 
Chili and me
'We
Harry we spoke with Martin
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand no strings I write any kind of agreement I want
Harry what 're you still doing with those guys
Oh yeah sure
What I 'm saying Harry is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house
No problem You go on off to bed
Well I got an audition tomorrow
Yeah that 's what we need More agents
With your experience you could always become an agent Right Harry
That 's where you got the idea
That Miami flight that went down it was on the news every day for about a week Harry must 've been busy
Maybe you did n't hear me
He 's telling me an idea for a movie It 's not bad so far Sit down have a drink Tell Karen let 's see what she thinks
How did you get in the house
I 'm going
Harry 
Anyone skim the pool It needs it
Harry are you going down or you want me to
You do n't What happened to Muff
I do n't have a dog
Yeah well I turned off the set I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor You know what could 've happened The dog came in and stepped on it turned the TV back on
When I came upstairs you stayed to finish your drink I told you to turn off the TV when you were through Come to think of it I also told you you could sleep in the maid 's room
I do n't hear anything
Be quiet and listen
What 's wrong
Shylock
The three hundred large What other money is there I should keep quiet I know till I 've read the script but I 've got a feeling about this one I 'm that shylock
What money
I have to run But what I hope to see they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it but in the end they ca n't Can they
Mob guy
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them it not only heightens the tension it adds a wistful element to their love
Which two
And after all you have such morals
I have to consider I mean as the mob guy this is another man 's wife I 'm sleeping with
Thanks
Hi sweetface You look great And mmmmm you smell good too
I 'm intrigued yeah You know what might help you take a look at the Cylone again the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels Hey  This your ride Chili
But you are interested
Yeah Karen knows him
Lufkin His agent
I know I 'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock Okay what 's my motivation The acquisition of money To collect Inflict pain if I have to
Oh for Christ 's sake 
'It did n't slip away Martin you did when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party
Yeah and I 'm wondering how did it go wrong How did it all slip away
Really
I 'm sitting here I 'm looking at you and I 'm having these flashes You know flashbacks of memories Of us

After fifty years there ai n't nothin left but shoe leather
You 'd think on a ship this size there 'd be something left to eat
Lem me see was that before or after the oil fire
The turbine blew
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
When they find out what it 's carrying they may not be so interested in what 's legal
Wrong It 's Friday
I do n't know Tuesday
What day is it
You find anything that even looks like a compressor I do n't care what grab it
I ai n't no mechanic just so you know
I need lag bolts especially one inch standard And sheet metal Preferably steel about a sixteenth of an inch Aluminium even tin 'll do
Yeah Hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later We call this in now gon na be Coastguard FBI who knows who all over the place
Let 's not be too hasty
She 's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we 'd never know it
Where 's his boat then Where 's his crew He ai n't gon na be out here by himself that 's for damn sure
We 'll see who 's dreamin m'man
Yeah but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gon na dream about
It 's a beautiful country Very clean Very civilized And cold
What 's so great about Sweden
Looks like it took out the backup genny too
One minute I 'm minding my own business the next thing I know the whole place is burning up An oxygen tank must 've blown on the welder Started an oil fire
Morning skipper
Damn mind of it 's own
Take it easy Dodge It 's only a piece of metal
Fucker
Yeah a ship that 's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago You do n't think that 's just a little freaky
Are you crazy Do you realize we got ourselves a ship We own a ship Dodge
Lem me see
That 's what it says
What You sure
Sixty pounds
How about now
Nah Everything was cool It 's just one of those things
You think the extra strain caused it
I do n't care what ai n't nobody just gon na let us walk away with a ship that size
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
Hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back
With that coxswain dickhead
Looks like Epps gon na get some tonight
I 'll sleep good tonight knowing that
Hear that Dodge Epps do n't think it 's a problem
Yeah yeah
Get up
What
Dodge Dodge
Why not
What say Epps You up for some roasted albatross
Hell no You think I 'm crazy
Did you
Right Wednesday
Try Wednesday
Then what the hell happened to him
Other than the obvious there 's nothing wrong with him that I can see not on the outside
I heard a scream When I got there I found him on the floor He was having some kind of seizure I did n't see anybody else
I do n't know what else you 'd call it He 's breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out He 's totally unresponsive to pain What happened up there
A what
I 'm no doctor But I 'd say he 's in a coma
Oh yeah
Smokes
Seen a lota movies
Pretty handy with that scatter gun Epps You raised on a farm
Maybe he is n't alone
One guy is n't gon na be so stupid
I 'm saying we got ta do whatever we got ta do to preserve our interest
So we kill him
Fifty million dollars Fifty million We gon na let this guy just take it from us One guy
Gim me a break
Maybe that is his boat
I 'm telling you I saw somebody I do n't know who it was But I saw somebody
Light in those passages ai n't so good
I like my job
What 're you crazy
Guess I 'll just keep working
I tell you one thing we 're not gon na be towing no ship now
What other choices have we got
Thanks for the warning Ow Damn
This 's gon na hurt a little
Or uninvited guests
Last thing we want is extra partners
Yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong That 's a damn big boat It 's either sunk or it ai n't
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot
Ever heard of insurance big boy
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either
Bring it on dude
Ready
Then we 'll all be doomed Any other questions
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it ai n't gon na be what you 'd call easy Any questions
Somebody 's probably looking for her as we speak
Out here What so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now
Probably slipped her moorings got tangled up in a current
No
You think that 's funny
Yeah
Roger
Roger
Maureen
Maureen
What
Maureen
It just occurred to me I do n't know your first name All this time and I do n't know it
What
What is your first name
Why not
One more
Amidships starboard at the beam Just under the waterline I do n't think it 's a problem
Where from
Right
Do n't fall asleep
Sorry
You 're late
There 's a charming thought
Tomorrow we 'll see if we ca n't find some line and tackle Use some of those bodies below decks for bait
Right
We 'll stand the watch on deck tonight You 're up first
Then you 're a lucky man
I do n't figure there 's much I want money ca n't buy
If money can buy what he wants
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants
Turbine chamber on number two must 've blown Took out part of the hull
What the hell happened
You better get down here right now We 're taking water Big time
Yeah
Look I did n't touch it Alright
Conveniently enough for you
I did n't touch the fucking radio Ever occur to you there 's somebody else on that boat skipper
I did n't touch the fucking radio
You did n't want us calling anybody Too liable to ruin your big payday
What the fuck
Do n't lie to me
What
You smashed it
Take it easy willya What about the radio
The radio Oh yeah the radio
The radio
Maybe you can tell me then
I think you know
I do n't know what you 're talking about
Just what the hell do you think you 're doing
With all due respect skipper Part of that up there 's mine I 'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it
There 's no way we 're gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here Besides it 'll be safer where it is
For starters getting that gold off the ship What they do n't know about is n't gon na bother them
What do you propose
Yeah well The truth is one thing When there 's more than a few hundred million dollars involved that 's a whole new deal
I guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth
Well they 're gon na be asking a lot of questions About us About those bodies About the gold Seems like we oughta be prepared is all
How do you mean
So I got a question Just from a you know purely technical standpoint We call the Coastguard Coastguard shows up What exactly is the plan
If they knew what they were carrying
On a passenger ship in 1953
Not me
It was a man 's voice Repeating some sort of children 's rhyme I do n't know it did n't make any sense You did n't hear it
I think you better see this for yourself
What is it
You better get down here quick skipper I 'm on C deck Cabin 400
Murphy
Dodge to Murphy
Right
Do what you need to do Just do it fast
I might be able to find something on the ship But it 's gon na take time
Ca n't you use something else
So whoever did this might still be around
That 'd be my guess
Could be meant as a warning
Damn barbaric is what it is
Fresh ai n't the first word that comes to mind
Bodies 're too fresh
Yeah reconsider fucking his shit up
If he 's reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal If not We 'll have to re-consider our options
We 'll stand a watch Four on eight off Low man first
What if that fucker finds it before we 're ready to go
Why not Why the fuck not
And what do you propose That we knock this guy off
I say fuck the motherfucker We 're a professional salvage crew going about our business What 's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway
Not in the eyes of the law
Bullshit That boat has n't made steam for fifty years We found her She 's ours
If somebody 's aboard her already she ai n't ours She 's theirs
Warm water current maybe making the metal expand
Sounds like the hull
Yeah yeah
Dreamin 's all any of you 're gon na be doing if we do n't get this boat running
How about you Epps
I 'm buyin me a nice outrigger Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget
The sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending what 's ours
Yeah yeah I 'm on it
So we get a little more for the boat Besides the gold 'll be safer where it is
You got ta be kidding What the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks
It looks like it
Then we 're rich We 're damn filthy stinking rich
A salvage claim to a vessel 's cargo 's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself It 's ours
So what 're we gon na do That 's the big question right
Either way they must 've had a pretty good reason
Or somebody stopped them
Then it happened before they scuttled her
Did n't happen yesterday I 'll tell you that Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it
What you think there 's something funny about it
It 's a hell of a lot of money
She take a radio
Went aboard
Man it gives me the creeps We got no business towing a ship that size anyway I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway
Obviously it 's some kind of screw up The shipping records are n't a hundred percent accurate
What do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened Ca n't do it skipper
Goddamit Dodge
Three four days
How long
I got ta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor
How long then
It 's a full 2500 horses down We could n't drag that boat down hill on ice with it
What about running number two by itself
I 'm telling you you do n't want to be running that fan like it is
We got ta get outa here Dodge A storm blows up and we 're history
Hard to say
But how long
The right way and the wrong way
I know I know two ways to do anything
Like I always say
How much longer 's that gon na take
Metal 's crystallized Got ta replace the whole deal
I thought you said it was just a blade
Turbine rotor 's shot
What 's this
Hard to say I got ta get in there and have a look At least a couple days Depending
How long to fix
The number one turbine 's pretty well trashed Number two runs but it 's way underpowered
Threw a turbine blade
What is it
Mother fucker
Sounds reasonable
With a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make Sitka in five days without another stop
The damn thing 's been floating around for God knows how long and it has n't hit anything yet So we take it easy A little of the old push pull
It 's a bloody navigation hazard One boat ca n't control a ship that size
It 's a risk I 'm willing to take
If you get it back in one piece
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage The fittings alone could go for a few million
Yeah from one side of the harbor to the other But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over
Smugglers maybe
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here It 's way out of the lanes There 's not a port for 800 miles
Are you kidding me Jealous Epps Gim me a break
You are n't jealous are you Dodge
I did n't sign up to go home empty handed And I sure ai n't gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this
I ca n't believe you Dodge 's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share
Nothing Let 's get outa here
What
Yeah Fine I just thought I heard something is all
You okay
Better than starving to death
I do n't even want to know what that 's gon na taste like now
I feel fine
Sudden flashes of light
Lights
Headache nausea lights
No
Any dizziness
Because of the gold
Stay away Or else
You 're a pal
Coffee
Maybe six feet Lanky I did n't get a good look He was far away But I saw him I saw him as sure as you 're standing there
What 'd he look like
Hell yeah I like it cold Colder the better
That 's a good thing
Hell yeah
That 's what I call a payday
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold
Probably did n't have time
Then why did n't they take it
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice
You mean before she sank
He 'd let you off at the nearest port that 's for sure
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass
Too big More like a freighter
Could be a fishing boat
I bet you did
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you Epps
Morning everybody
Maybe twenty gallons an hour
What 's slow
I wish I could believe that Either way you know what I 've done I 've got no choice
I do n't give a damn about the gold
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo There 's nothing supernatural about greed And that 's what it comes down to pure and simple
It 's a trap There was no way we were gon na get away with that gold Nobody ever does It 's just the bait This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out
I know a little bit about human nature and what I 've seen only confirms that
It 's the ship The ship 's making you think this way
I think I see it pretty well
Murphy do n't you see what 's happening
I did n't want it to turn out this way
And now you 're gon na kill me is that it
The way I figure it it was them or me I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch Bought a little time Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around But it 's just us on this ship Us and your spirit friends
So you killed them
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody You saw it coming as well as I did Dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat And Greer too except he went nuts Could n't take it I guess Could 've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage But did it make him any less dangerous I do n't think so
You killed them
Greer 's gone He broke out of the tank
We 're in an island chain It 's only a matter of time before we hit another one
What
We hit land
What happened
It 's not the weather I 'm worried about The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat
If the weather holds it might not be so bad
Hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water
Crazy with greed Not crazy Not like him
They went crazy
Maybe it was more than that
Over the gold
Could be a stroke Who knows The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves Like wild dogs
What do you think
Leave him till we can get some help From now on nobody comes down here
What do we do with him
Right here
Epps You there
He 's not on deck and I ca n't raise him on the radio
Nope
Either of you seen Dodge
Epps over
Murphy to Epps
Just lucky I guess
Why you How come the rest of us have n't seen these people
I do n't know
What 's that supposed to mean
She said the ship was evil That we had to leave right away That if we did n't we might never leave
More than just a mutiny More than just the gold
That much I think we 've already established
Something bad happened here Murphy
Victims of what
No I think they are were just passengers Innocent victims
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks
What happened
Showing you what
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word It was more than that As though they were showing me
I do n't know what else you 'd call her One second she was there the next she was gone
What like some kind of ghost
No Someone else A girl I 'm not sure she was real
Not our mystery guest again
When you found me yesterday at the pool I 'd seen something Someone
I do n't know are we
Are we smart enough to avoid that
Never mind Before your time I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune Equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide What happened after that is anybody 's guess But judging by our Greek friends down below it does n't look like the last time
The what
I guess that 's the sixty four thousand dollar question is n't it
What do you think happened on this boat
Wish I could say the same
Could n't sleep
Hey
Hey
Does n't matter
It 's not gon na hold us
Let 'em ask This ship 's legally ours now
It 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too
If it was a ship she hit
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it
But where 's the damage
The page 's missing Then their SOS was real
Collision With what
Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision Distress calls have been made
Must not 've been the captain 's entry He was probably out of the picture by then
The same day she supposedly went down
February first
The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill
But who
Smashed it up pretty bad
Somebody took it out of commission last night
What
The ah the radio 's out
Only something must 've gone wrong
If they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
You 're saying they mutinied for the gold
Possibly false Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea I do n't think mutiny 's out of the question here
They 're dead in the water that morning Four hours later the captain 's relieved of his command And that evening they issue a general SOS
No I 'll try again later
Same Any luck
How 's he doing
I 'll call us in Dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up Keep an eye on him
He needs a doctor
I do n't know No Not Greer Somebody
Greer
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio
Yeah Just a bird Just a stupid bird
You just shoot at something
Epps
Murphy to Epps
Yup
Got your light
No cowboy shit Right
No cowboy shit up there understand
Dodge get on that turbine I do n't care if you do n't sleep for a week The sooner you 're done the sooner we can get out of here How 's the food situation
Guess that 'd be me Again
We do n't exactly have the best bargaining position
So we find this guy and make a deal with him
It was n't you It was somebody else There 's somebody else aboard
You sure it was n't me
Of course I 'm sure I saw him
Are you sure
I saw him Just a minute ago Some guy
What What the hell 're you talking about
There 's somebody else on this boat
What guy
The guy He just came this way
Who
Did you see him
Take it easy you 'll live longer
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
Why not call for help
Maybe But there 's always somebody whose interest 's at stake
Maybe they did n't want it back Maybe the whole fat deal was insured
Only way to be
You 're more practical than superstitious
I think we 'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current
You think she 's sailing without a crew
Nobody knows There 've been a lot of theories of course But we 'll never really know for sure
So what did happen
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872 One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel the Dei Gratia As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste On boarding they found her completely deserted The captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble The table was even set for dinner And in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard
Nope
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste
Well suppose she got a little further north than she should have Got stuck in the ice The passengers and crew evacuated She froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid They write it off Fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens The ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her
Her destination was Halifax yeah
She was sailing up north right
Some charts A crew manifest Looks like her last voyage was January 1953 The question is where the hell 's she been since
What 'd you find up there
Yeah Thanks
Coffee
They must 've scuttled it Nobody just lets a ship float away
The law 's on our side If they want to challenge it let them try
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks At least Who knows could be more Could be a lot more What I 'm proposing is we split it four ways
Go on
It 's my pen name
Candy
Fine with me
Nobody 's going anywhere with that gold now Anybody tries to board we 'll know about it You can do what you want Greer But neither of us is gon na risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that
All I 'm saying is that gold 's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was
You think whoever did this is reasonable
Now hold up just a minute Let 's be reasonable here
Leave it
What about the gold
Does n't look like it much matters
So whoever did this now has our shotgun
Ca n't find the shotgun
Must 've heard something below deck and went down to check it out
He took the shotgun and a light
The mooring has n't come taught
We 're still drifting
Government weather It 's got a transmitter aboard
A what
It 's a Noaa buoy
Must be a little too the truth eh Dodge
Shut up
Gettin a little hot under the collar I 'd say
The coast guard has our last position They 'll send somebody out soon enough A ship this size you ca n't exactly miss
We ai n't exactly in what you 'd call your high traffic neighborhood either
Alright Everybody grab your gear This is where we get off
We 're not gon na be able to pump it
I wish I could tell you I 'd be real interested to know myself
We heard you scream Any idea what you might 've seen
Oh man
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins
Say what
You 've been out for about a day
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera Down somewhere in there scavenging around
You do n't remember
What happened
Lost my sea legs
How 're you feeling
Drink up then
Never been more thirsty in my life
Maybe
Maybe Epps 's mystery man had something to do with it
And look what happened
Greek citizen Merchant navy Obviously we are n't the first to come across this ship They probably stumbled across it just like we did
Could n't have happened much more than a month ago
Ho-ly shit
We 'll have to take it easy then I do n't think we 'll find much aboard the ship but it 's probably worth looking around
Pretty low all around
Would you hold on just a minute here please Look there 's no reason to panic now Epps saw somebody Fine It 's a big boat Chances 're real good he does n't even know about the gold If we stay cool nobody 'll be the wiser The gold stays where it is til we 're ready to go Like I said it 'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here
I say we off-load some of that gold now
Supposing he wants to get bad with us
Let 's just take it easy here alright Nobody 's gon na kill anybody
I do n't know
Moving to Sweden
Greer
Not much at all I guess Retire Live out my golden years and all that
Fifty million four ways That 's twelve million and change a piece What you gon na do with your share skipper
And get a bunch of fools sniffin around here
We could call for help
What now
Dodge you got ta get on those repairs
I heard that
It 's worth the effort Believe me Besides we 're gon na need her to prove the salvage
Yeah but we still got ta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka
We leave it where it is Stick to the plan
So what We gon na unload the gold and get a move on
Not for fifty million An ocean liner maybe But fifty million in gold they come looking for
If they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off
Ho baby
Hard to say Maybe forty fifty million
How much you figure that 's worth skipper
Guess I must 've fallen back to sleep Where 's Epps
You 're up late
Morning
Yeah
Some classy tub in it 's day huh
So we cut her loose and wait it out A little weather could n't be anything she has n't seen before
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it
We 've done it before
You mean tow her back That 's a thirty thousand ton ship you 're talking about
Whatever the reason she 's adrift and abandoned We 've got every right to salvage her
Sorry
Murphy goddamit
Besides a little rust everything 's pretty well-preserved
How 's that
It 's funny
Steer to one eight five Let 's check her out
Call the Coastguard
Looks like it 's adrift
Too deep to anchor out there
Alright I 'll be right up
I been watching it for close to an hour and it has n't moved I ca n't raise it on the radio either Makes me think it might be in trouble
There 's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west
Yeah
Red sky in morning sailor take warning
Red sky at night sailor 's delight
Better than making hamburger for Mickey D
You got that right
I must be in the wrong business
He 'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia
What do you say Dodge
Let the buyer beware
Of course they did
The number nine on the starboard side 's half flooded Epps says it 's a slow leak just under the waterline about twenty gallons an hour They must 've pumped it before we left Sitka
Go
Greer to Murphy
Or what
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me Tarzan
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you 're interrupting it
I heard you But I 'm choosing to ignore you Epps let 's go
Did n't you hear me grandpa Or you got your hearing aid turned down
As I said what seems to be the trouble
Why n't you mind your own business chief
What seems to be the trouble ladies
You want fair pay make hamburger for Mickey D Otherwise please to sign
You 're kidding right
Twenty You knock off twenty and then we see After my guy looks at it
Fifteen at the most
That cost me twenty grand at least
You pump it out and re-seam the hull she 'll be good as new
No no You got leak
You got a leak in the number nine compartment
What 's this
Better late than never
I thought you say Tuesday
JUST DO IT
But I ca n't
What 's wrong with you Tell him I 'm not here
I just buzzed him in
What do you mean on his way up
Actually I was just checking to see if you were here your friend Seymour is on his way up
I-I 'm not sure yeah maybe
She understands what you 're going through and she really wants to help you She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it
I was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry I 'll be completely out of her life in a few days
Yeah I heard about that
About what
Are you going to yell at me
Pumpkin are you in there
Well as you know Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want
What
I 've got some important news to tell you but it can wait till later if you 're not feeling
It 's nothing it 's just some hormonal thing do n't worry about it
Nothing
Pumpkin What 's wrong
Tell her to forget it I do n't need her help
Well Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience but she thinks she can convince them
I guess
Are you still looking for a job
What is it now
I have some good news for you Pumpkin
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow
I made spaghetti Do you want some
Hi Look I 'm kind of tired I think I 'll go to bed
God how horrifying
Yup
Not the Maxine
Maxine
YES
Give up
Who
Someone from the past
How should I know
Guess
Who
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place
Look at me I 'm not even listening to a word you 're saying
Well I think it 's good to keep all your options open You can always enroll for the winter quarter You could even live here and go to the city college part time and still get a job if you wanted to
Look I told you I 'm not going to college
It 's tough to find a good job without any kind of training
Will you get off my back for once
Not if I do n't find that goddamn spatula
Nope What are you making pancakes
Have you seen my blue spatula
I ca n't believe this I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me
Enid and I were just friends You know we feel comfortable around each other she really likes my old records and
Please tell me it is n't that teenager
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen
It 's just that I feel like it 's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out
What are you trying to say
I uh I feel that I need to uh there 's something I feel I have to say I uh I 've never said this to anyone before believe me I 've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I would n't have to do this but I uh
Hey so what brings you down here
We 're almost done Hi Yeah no it 's excluded They 've already paid the earnest money well let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through Right great sounds good
Oh please do n't let me interrupt finish your phone call
Seymour Hello What are you doing here
Hello
Dana Hi Uh Dana this is Enid
Seymour uh hello I guess I 'm a little early
Really I never really cared for those Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one
Uh no I missed that one But what do I know I like Laurel and Hardy movies
I 'm so excited to see this film Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director Did you see his last film The Flower That Drank The Moon It was simply glorious
Oh all right Party-pooper Just let me put a few things away
Hey it 's nearly nine already we 're gon na have to leave now if we 're going to make that movie
No really I
Do n't be silly anyone can dance Here just follow me watch my feet
Uh well that 's okay I do n't dance heh heh
Oh I just love this song Is n't it great Does n't it make you want to dance C'mon
Was it Bosnia I forget It 's so sad the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention She goes over and turns it up
Yeah where is this Bosnia
Here we are it 's mocha mint from Lickety Splits Oh is n't that photograph just heart-rending
Oh I love to cook I guess most women would n't invite a man over on the first date but I believe you should trust your instincts When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so I do n't know harmless Ready for ice cream
That was great jeez thanks again for cooking all this
I 'm sorry Enid you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you I had to give it to someone else But I 'm sure next year I can
But can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy
Well they 're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition but do n't worry I 'm sure I 'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall
Help me what
Oh my goodness well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I 'm going to do everything I can to help you
I did n't check my messages
Did n't Principal Jaffee call you
Huh
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper it 's absolutely
What do you mean
Enid I 'm so sorry about what happened
Let me know as soon as you can Enid This could be a great thing for you
I
Well yes
I dunno Would I have to take classes and stuff
So what do you think
wow
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything it is really quite an offer
Hmm
Well I know this is really short notice but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art Design and she tells me that I 'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program and well I hope you do n't mind Enid but I took the liberty of submitting your name
I 'm not really sure working I guess
Do n't worry it 's nothing bad I was just wondering what your plans were for next year
Uh-oh
Enid can I talk to you for a minute
I 'm not sure I mean I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking
And how does an image like this help us to see that
It 's complicated I guess I 'm trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now it 's hidden or something
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism
Well no it 's more like a found art object
Did you actually do this painting
Well I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook 's Chicken used to be called Coon 's Chicken and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture
These are all valid comments but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this
I see interesting
I dunno I just like Don Knotts
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject
It 's supposed to be Don Knotts
Who is this Enid
Enid It 's sort of like a diary I guess
And what can you tell us about this
Jesus
It 's not optional
But I feel weird it 's so sleazy
Well lose it And why are n't you pushing the large sizes Did n't you get training about upsizing
What I 'm just kidding around with the customers It 's my shtick
What the hell is wrong with you
Okay okay I wo n't say a word
Look we do n't pay you to be a movie critic just do your job
But I was only trying to be friendly
Look that 's the policy if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater
Why What difference does it make You already got his money
What are you doing You do n't ever criticize the feature
You can count on me sir
I 'm gon na let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself that way I can evaluate your performance while it 's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds
Are you ready to go
Hey Josh
Hi Enid
Just take my word for it if she ever finds out about this I 'll never hear the end of it
Okay I promise
Because if you do I 'll kill you
Why not
I do n't think we should Look you have to totally promise me you wo n't tell Becky about this
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere
I could n't sleep I should get going I feel really weird
How long have you been up
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars It 's so typical Either they 're into cars or guns or sports or guitars it 's so obvious
Oh hi
Why do you have that stupid poster
You must have known all along how I you know how I felt about you it must be totally obvious God I always used to dream about this
It 's just my stupid way of getting attention God I practically love you Josh
Yeah well
That 's just the way I am
You make me nervous I always feel like you 're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me
You 've never once said anything even remotely nice to me
When did I say I hated you
Then why do you hate me so much
Nothing
Yeah right well why not What 's so wrong with me
Yeah right
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms
What do you mean why
Why
Do you want something to drink
I guess
Are you the one who left that note
Can I come in
Hi what 's up
Yeah well hi

No
Come on Josh do n't you want to see where he lives
Forget it
Oh my God that 's HIM
Jesus look at this guy
I figured something like that
In answer to your question I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form

No I 'm serious Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell
Yeah right
SHH He 's back there I can see his hair bobbing up and down

I 'm sorry about the other day I do n't know what 's wrong with me I really do want to move in with you
I need to talk to you
Hello
FUCK YOU Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life
You 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy
You 're the psycho You have n't been able to deal with anything since high school ended
Because you 'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it
There 's something wrong with every single place we look at Why do n't you just come right out and tell me you do n't want to move in with me
Well what am I supposed to say I ca n't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere
Oh yeah I can tell you really love it
I said great
What It looks totally normal what 's wrong with it
Great
Twenty-seven fifty-three do you see it That must be it
I do n't know God do n't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes
When was this
Nothing
Why What did he say
He came into work
What When did you see Josh
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood
I just mean it 's weird to me I 've never been anywhere near here in my life
It 's a totally normal average neighborhood
Where are we This is a weird neighborhood
Yeah well you said you were busy look I 'd better get going I 'll call you tomorrow
I do n't believe you
Just some people from work
What are you talking about Who
Actually I 'm just about to go out with some friends
So should I come over
How repulsive
I ca n't believe it he actually scored
What happened to Seymour
Do you still want to do something tonight
Hello
God I 'm so sick of Seymour
Oh yeah maybe Seymour 's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls so I can hear how bad it went
That guy 's band is playing tonight Alien Autopsy
What thing
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight
You 're insane
You do n't have to I 'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job
I ca n't imagine spending money on towels
Do n't you want nice stuff
Why do you care about this kind of stuff
I 'm sick of waiting we need to start getting stuff if we 're ever going to move Are n't these the greatest towels
I ca n't afford stuff like this right now
Look we have to get these
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster Let 's just try and keep everything the way it is
Yeah but maybe one of us should at least try
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that
I am not I just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do
God you 're really obsessed
No really
Go ahead
I think one of us should fuck Josh
Yeah I guess call me
Well are we still going shopping tomorrow
I ca n't it 's Seymour 's birthday Shit What time is it I have to go to the store I was going to make him a cake
Do you want to do something tonight
Yeah thanks
If it makes you feel any better I do n't think you could 've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff
Do n't worry
Now are you going to get a regular job
Oh yeah right like I 'm gon na let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus
What was that all about I thought everything must go
Oh my god I remember this hat this was during your little old lady phase
Fuck it Everything must go
This is it I ca n't believe you 're selling some of this stuff
I told you my manager was a total asshole Do n't worry I 'm going to get another job and anyway I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime
What are you talking about What kind of loser gets fired after one day
We were such desperate sluts back then
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine
Seventh you wanted to move out right then
Was n't it like eighth grade
Anyway now we can start looking for the apartment Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment
I dunno but next week is my last class
When are you finally going to get your diploma
Yeah maybe it 'll be okay At least I 'll get to see every movie for free I guess I had to lie and tell them I already graduated
Are you kidding It 's a dream job I ca n't believe you got a job like that without even trying God I wish that was my job
Get away from me
maybe we should be lesbos
Have n't you heard about the miracle of masturbation
That 's not true I just hate all these obnoxious extroverted pseudo bohemian losers Sometimes I think I act so weird because I 'm crazy from sexual frustration
Face it you hate every single boy on the face of the earth
Yeah right Believe me at this point I 'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me
You 're just jealous
He 's like the biggest idiot of all time
He gives me a total boner
Which one
You 're gross See that guy
Or maybe did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos Maybe that 's why we spend so much time together
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you
I wonder if I hang around with you because you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly
you do n't have to make a million dollars just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment
God I ca n't believe you went to Anthony 's without me
Nothing Do n't worry I promise I 'll get a job next week
Like what
I 'm working on it I 've got a few leads it 's just that right now I have all these projects that take up all my time
Yeah well So when are you going to get your job
But those are our people
No it does n't You 'll see you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos
That rules
He 's a total asshole He does n't even need that wheelchair he 's just totally lazy
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining
I do n't know Some people are okay but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody
God how can you stand all these assholes
He does that every single day
That guy is totally amazing
You cunt
Just now I went with Seymour
No way when
Anthony 's II
Where
You wo n't believe it Guess

I do n't believe you
It 's a surprise
What Where
I know a party we could go to
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job
Let 's get out of here this place makes me sick
Forget it I 'm sure it sucks All these movies suck
How about this
God are n't you tired of Seymour yet
This morning at Seymour 's garage sale
Ew when did you get that
Hey you have to see my new good luck charm
How about this one
Everybody 's too stupid
I did n't get it either
It 's not like I 'm some modern Punk dickhead It 's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it
What was that all about
It 'll only take a second
Why are we going here I hate this place
Should we leave a note
Yeah he 's beyond human stuff like that
I 'll bet he never jerks off
JOSH
JOSH
Why do n't you ask him
I wonder if he 's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or
Waiting for the bus that never comes
As always
There he is
Hassle
Let 's go hassle Josh
Where are we going
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back
It 's always closed
We still have to go in there sometime
Fuck you bitch
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade
What How long have you been standing there
Okay okay I promise Jesus you 're out of your mind
Just promise you 'll do it
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you
That 's who people want to rent to It 's a known fact that it 's way easier to get a job and everything if you 're rich All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it 's no big deal it 'll be fun
What are you talking about
I 've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we 're like these totally rich yuppies
What is she black now
Funky
Somewhere downtown
We 're not sure yet that 's why we 're looking
Forget it I ca n't explain it
Not really
Yeah but you know what I mean
That guy is many things but he definitely is n't cool This one would be okay but there 's no kitchen
I dunno I kind of like him He 's the exact opposite of everything I really hate In a way he 's such a clueless dork that he 's almost cool
He should totally just kill himself Hey here 's one Oh wait you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats
Oh yeah
What about the striking redhead in the yellow dress
It was so cute how he had his own little bags I thought I was going to start crying Do you think they 're gay
He was so excited when you bought that record you 're a saint God these apartments are super expensive
I know I still ca n't get over that his name was Seymour
That was truly pathetic
Ew it 's like some gross rat
I think it 's cute look at his little weasel teeth
Gross
Ew look at this
Come on it 's too late now
What should we do What if he recognizes us
Bingo
The W.C Fields Fan Club Newsletter Oh my God The National Psoriasis Foundation
I 'm afraid if I see him I 'll start feeling really bad again
He wo n't see us we 'll just stalk him from a distance
This is way too creepy
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time
I know would n't you be totally pissed off
He does n't even look that bummed out really
We should follow him home
He 's insane
Totally Look
Are you sure
I dunno
Do you think he knows
He 's still just sitting there God this is totally unbearable
What 's he doing now
Oh my god he just ordered a giant glass of milk
What 's going on now What 's he doing
I ca n't believe it
It 's obviously him
What exactly is a cardigan anyway
Is he wearing a green cardigan
She says she wants to MMPH
SHUT UP
I 'm going to tell him you said that
I want to make love to him
It 's still twenty-five minutes early
Look maybe that 's him
Yeah Josh c'mon MOVE IT
I know look at the way he drives he 's like an old man
God I think Josh is too mature for us
Shh it 's his answering machine We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP
What does it stand for
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for dwarf
You 're better at it
Why do I always have to do it
You call
Oh yeah
You know the green cardigan guy
Which loser
Hey We forgot to call the loser
Fuck you
That Larry guy what look was he going for A gay tennis player from the forties
What are you talking about who
I bet Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with you always go for guys with some lame fake shtick
I want to do him
No she was the second wife The third one was the super-bitch Maxine There Look at her
I can never keep them all straight was she the super-bitch
There 's my dad with Joanie
I remember every minute of that party
Look that 's back when I hated you
What a little hosebag
Look at how cute I am
I 've been looking all over for this
You lent it to me in like tenth grade
Hey why do you have this
I dunno John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff There 's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace
What is this
Wait I just want to see what 's on this tape
So what should we do
Is n't it weird It 's her favorite
Does Oomie really like this show
Oh we totally have to
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead
I know And he 's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail
God that 's so pathetic I bet she did n't even notice him
Jesus Listen to this one Do you remember me Airport shuttle June 7th You striking redhead with yellow dress pearl necklace brown shoes I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens Am I crazy or did we have a moment
Gross
Okay well here 's yours Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken Not this one Stunning bod very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer
You can have that one
God this paper is so boring Who reads all this shit Here we go Windsurfing Doctor Mensan IQ maverick Sagittarius Let 's hit the clubs make each other laugh
Check out the Personals maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us
What does that even mean
I know and instead of dessert it says Mindbenders
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu Like The Salad Explosion
You loser
I might actually get the pasta special
Can we call you Weird Al
Hi Al
I feel as though I 've stepped into a time warp
Who can forget this great hit from the 50 's
God it 's so totally pathetic
Authentic 50 's diner Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950 's
Hey look at this
Okay okay
Maybe they 're slowly poisoning us or they 're planning to brainwash us and
Or maybe not
Maybe there 's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us
That lets us off the hook
You know sacrifice virgins and stuff
What do you do if you 're a satanist anyway
In fact never
Much later
We should follow them
Hey look the satanists are leaving
I know it has n't really hit me yet
God it 's so weird that we 're finally out of high school We 've been waiting for this our whole life Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want It 's such a weird feeling
Yeah I just picked the one that sounded the easiest
Did you sign up yet
Soon I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes
So when are we going to start looking for our apartment
Just look at them
Why
Look at these people behind you I 'm totally convinced they 're Satanists
Hi
God think about that that 's actually totally depressing
Good
God just think we 'll never see Dennis again
He better watch out or he 'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her
How perfect
Oh my god look Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh
I know she needs to die immediately
Since when is she an actress
Forget it
What Why
Uh oh do n't turn around
Shut up
Unless they 're in your Summer school class
Just think we 'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again
This is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again
This is so bad it 's almost good
You loser
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year I did n't think that just because you get an F that means you have to take the class over again
Why
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class
What
What Oh suck my fucking dick
It 's totally sickening Let 's see if they gave me the right diploma
I know I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she 's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up
God what a bunch of retards
See that 's exactly the kind of thing we 're trying to avoid
Well I 'm going to major in Business Administration and I think minor in Communications
What are you going to be when you grow up Todd
Just because
Really Both of you Why not
We 're not
Oh hey Enid So we finally made it
What about me Am I not even here
I love this place it 's so you know funky
Well we wo n't keep you
My acting workshop is across the street from here I 'm just on my break
What are you doing here Melorra
Oh my god what are you guys doing here
Well bye you guys CONGRATULATIONS
Oh yeah that 'll definitely happen
I 'm going to be in this actor 's workshop and I 'm hoping to start going on auditions soon I 'm so excited to finally have some free time We have to get together this summer
Nothing
So what are you guys doing this Summer
Yeah we graduated high school how totally amazing
Oh my God you guys I ca n't believe we made it
Listen young lady I know you do n't like me I do n't really care whether you do or not but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do
Oh yeah like he even noticed
I want to know what you think you 're doing staying out all night and worrying your father to death
Shhh
May I ask what you 're doing
I 'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards
It 's really quite something to see you all grown up like this Enid I 'd love to hear about what you 're doing I ca n't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out What are you studying You were always such a smart little girl
Where did you get those pants
Do n't mind me I 'll just be in my room
It 's kind of falling apart
I 'm thinkin maybe I could let it go
I thought it was n't for sale
You still interested in that
Him Seymour He 's the man with the records
Who does
Seymour does
Do you have any other old records besides these
That 's okay
Perhaps the Jam-in-ator appeals to you Absolutely no practice necessary You shread like a giant Just press a button
Umm That 's not officially for sale I might have to hang onto that for the time being
How much is this
A mongoose they eat snakes you never heard of a mongoose That 's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that
A what
ELLIS Get a job
Go die asshole
ELLIS I 'm so sorry if you were offended
That tape sucked by the way
ELLIS Oh how punk
ELLIS Yeah yeah yeah Do you have my money

ELLIS If you really want to fuck up the system you should go to business school that 's what I 'm gon na do get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside
I know it 's over asshole I
ELLIS Punk rock is over
Tell me what
ELLIS Did n't they tell you
You do n't know what you 're talking about
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago There are no buses on this street
Yes

Norman
Hi what 's your name
Later Dude
Hey where are you going
Thanks for the tape I 'll have to pay you later I 'm broke
Fuck you you stupid redneck hick
Tsk You Jews are so clever with money
I did too
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine
Did you bring that tape
Fine and how are you
You 're late asshole
Well if it is n't Enid and Rebecca the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend
God fuck you
Why do you even want it It would look stupid on you
Well why do I care about that
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity
You 're crazy it should be like two dollars
Five hundred
What
That 's five hundred dollars
I can treat him any way I want to I 'm an adult Leave me alone
I really want to talk to you I 've been thinking about what you said about moving in here
Shhh I really need to get some sleep
But I
I was just thinking out loud I mean you 've got this whole thing with Dana I 'm not going to let you fuck that up
You must know I always did you really mean all that about moving in with me
Yeah well me neither
I-I never expected anything like this to happen
No forget it
I will if you want to
What Maybe no I dunno
Do you really want us to drive away somewhere
God Dana 's going to kill you
What 's the matter with you Seymour Do n't you like me Be a man for once in your life
I-I-I
What do you want
What do you want
I 'm serious I 'm just so sick of everybody Why ca n't I just do whatever I want
I dunno I
Who cares Let 's just go what 's stopping us
So where would we go
I 'll drive then we 'll go out in a blaze of glory
I do n't think I 'm in any condition to drive
You know what we should do Let 's go get in your car right now and just take off We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life fuck everybody
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it and I 'd just disappear and they 'd never see me again
I guess I probably used to when I was your age
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place Do you ever think about stuff like that
What
You know what my number one fantasy used to be
Yeah well I like you too
Oh yeah and Dana You were a lot more fun before you met Dana You 've been acting way too normal lately you 're a bitter twisted fucked-up guy Seymour that 's why I like you
What about Joe
Maybe I should just move in here with you I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job
Yeah sure Of course
I dunno I always feel like everybody secretly hates me I 'm just paranoid I guess I mean you like me do n't you We 're good friends right
I mean of course I why would n't I want to go out with you
Yeah but still it 's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that
You 're a beautiful young girl I ca n't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date you never asked me out
I hate sports
At least you 're not like every other stupid guy in the world all they care about are guitars and sports they 're all such fags
I 'm just being realistic
What are you talking about You 're disappointed every minute of your life
If you expect the worst you 're never disappointed
That 's great Half-empty that 's what I like about you Seymour you 're a natural pessimist
God she 's going to kill me this bottle is half-empty
Jesus how can you stand her
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping She said it did n't go with her stuff so she gave it to me she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs
Where did you get this
I could never move I 've got too much stuff
You need a bigger place this is like a little kid 's room
FUCK DANA I 'm sick of Dana
That 's Dana 's I 'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary You better not
What about this
Uh I think there 's some root beer
Do you have anything to drink
What 's the matter
Look I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I 'll leave you alone
Uh sure come in
Can you at least let me in
What 's up
I had to see you
What are you doing here
Nothing Do n't worry I wo n't bother you any more
What do you mean
I do n't think you understand how I really feel about you Seymour
I do n't know I 'm sorry but Dana 's a very jealous person I just do n't want to screw that up right now I 'm sure she 'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends
In whatever way you think I mean
In what way do you mean
So do you like me Seymour
No of course not
Does that mean you do n't like me
I I do n't think so
You must have done something to make her think you like me
Just someone so young
What does she mean by that somebody like me
No no not exactly she just does n't understand how I would know somebody like you
What 's her problem anyway Did she actually tell you you could n't see me
No of course I do It 's just that right now I need to
So that 's it You do n't ever want to see me again
Well you know what do I know about clothes I 've never been the most fashionable guy it 's nice to have someone do all the work for me
And you like them
Oh uh they were a present from Dana
It 's just that well you know Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I do n't want to give her the wrong idea you know
Well when can we do something
I I wish I could Enid but I really ca n't right now I it 's just that I
Well forget the art show let 's do something else
I better not
Of course you should C'mon I 'm already a million hours late
I I do n't know I do n't really think I should
I 'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date There 's something I have to show you
Maybe I dunno He wants to be of course I 'm weighing several offers at the present time
so is he your boyfriend now
I dunno okay I guess I fucked that guy Josh finally
I-I 'm sorry uh so uh how
Are n't you even going to ask me how I 'm doing
No no it 's just that I should get going in a few minutes and
What are you trying to get rid of me
We really should get together sometime soon I-I 'll definitely call you this week
Sounds good
Sort of she does n't dislike any of that stuff she 's trying anyway actually we 're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon
So what kind of stuff do you guys do together Is she into old records and stuff
Oh pretty well surprisingly you know
Yeah I 'll bet So how 's it going with what's-her-name Dana
I know I 'm sorry I-I 've been really busy
No actually Joe told me you were here so how come you never call me anymore
Really
Where have you been I 've been looking all over for you I 've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you
YAAA
Boo
Jesus Enid I 'll talk to you later bye
What are you going to like have sex with her on your first date
Yeah so I better go it 's not really the best time to talk
What You 're kidding me
Actually it 's kind of still happening she 's over here right now I think everything 's going pretty well
So what happened
Oh hi
Hi it 's me
Uh hello
Well uh I 'm an expert-about stuff like this she was totally for real
How can you be so sure
Seymour I promise you that was n't a joke you have to call her back
Uh yeah A long time ago she called before once it 's just somebody trying to humiliate me
That did n't sound like a joke to me what did you write a personal ad or something
It 's just somebody 's idea of a joke
Wow What was that all about
Let the machine get it I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me
Are n't you going to get that
Who knows
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them
I wo n't even dignify that with a response
Never mind it 's way too complicated Did you have problems like this when you were my age where you 're totally confused all the time
Why
Oh wait you met him remember that guy Josh I 'm like practically obsessed with him but I ca n't do anything about it because Becky would freak out
Oh yeah
Actually I 've got a total crush on this one guy right now but it 's a really fucked-up situation
Then again that 's easy for me to say since I 'll never even get a date I 'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you
I know It 's not like it makes all your problems go away
I 'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really would n't change anything
Never
Really
I mean I 'm eighteen years old and I 've never even had a real steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks
That 's the spirit
Yeah well you 're not the only one Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems It seems like only stupid people have good relationships
Maybe now you understand why I ca n't get a date
What like a girdle
Oh uh It 's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support
What is that
It 's just my stupid back I 'll be all right in a minute
Are you okay
Arrrghhh Ah Jeez Christ
No Doofus blow it out
Oh uh thanks a lot Enid I really appreciate it
You can open your eyes now
Do n't you trust me Seymour
I dunno they 're very sensitive at work about all this stuff Maybe it would be better if you
I promise I 'll take good care of it
What Why
Hey can I borrow this
No in a lot of ways things are better now I dunno it 's complicated Everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something
So I do n't really get it are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this
I make enough money to eat and buy old records what more do I want
Yeah but still
Hey I get good benefits a good early retirement plan nobody ever bothers me
Jesus I 'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day
Nothing so glamorous actually I 'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters
What are you a fry cook or something
For nineteen years
You work at Cook 's Chicken
Actually I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook 's phenomenon when I was about your age I 've kind of lost interest since I 've been working for them
Yeah well Cook 's is just a made up name When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named The Coon Chicken Inn that 's an early painting of their first logo
Four-piece Cook 's special deep fried with side n slaw it 's OUT RAY-GEOUS
Yeah right I 'm a klansman thanks a lot Do you know the Cook 's Chicken franchise
What are you a klansman or something
What Oh that I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago I guess it 's mine now
What the fuck Seymour What is this
I dunno because I ca n't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you ca n't get a date
If you do n't mind my asking why do you care so much if I get a date or not
Wow this is so cool
Yet
It does n't matter I 'm not staying long I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet
I 'm not sure I have anything to drink there might be some
Hooray for me
I 'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar At least you 're an interesting person at least you 're not exactly like everybody else
But it 's not totally hopeless for you I 've had it I do n't even have the energy to try anymore You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you do n't end up like me
Yeah well I ca n't relate to humanity either but I do n't think it 's totally hopeless
Yeah well it 's simple for everybody else give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they 're happy I just ca n't relate to 99.9 of humanity
It 's not hopeless
Look I really appreciate your help Enid but let 's face it this is hopeless
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is n't a total idiot that 's all
Now I remember why I have n't gone anywhere in months I 'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there I might as well be from another planet
Jesus
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label
What did you tell that girl
Just wait here
Wait a minute Hang on Jesus I got ta think of something to talk to her about No No
Well offer her a seat You want me to do it
Yes that would certainly do
Jesus Seymour
What are we in slow motion here What are ya hypnotized Have some more kids why do n't you For Christ 's sake would you move
I 'm not holding my breath in that department
This bar 's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from
I brought it for him to autograph He 's going to be amazed to see it it 's one of two known copies I ca n't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner What an insult
So why did you bring this along
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud it 's like someone jabbing me in the face KFTO comin atchya on this beautiful evening
Relax Seymour relax
C'mon Seymour please
Uh I do n't have much money with me right now
These are older women just dressed up to look young I think
Look at this Lollipop Lolitas is n't child pornography totally illegal
OH MY GOD
Shh
Wow Look at all these creeps
Fine I 'll go by myself then
I really do n't think it 's a good idea
PLEASE We have to
I do n't think so
We 'll just go in for one minute it 'll be a riot
I I 'd really rather not
Please Seymour Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we ca n't get any boys to take us Please
Yeah sure very funny
Oh my god We have to go in here
Well are
Josh He 's nobody 's boyfriend He 's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture
So is that your boyfriend
Let 's just say music that way you only use up one Wait we have to go in here for a second
Well let 's see I guess I 'd have to put Traditional Jazz Blues and Ragtime music at the top of the list then probably
Yeah yeah yeah Just tell me your five main interests in order of importance
Maybe I do n't want to meet someone who shares my interests I hate my interests Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself
We need to narrow this down somehow we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests
I mean as long as she 's not a complete imbecile and she 's even remotely attractive
Every guy has a type
I 'm just not one of those guys who has a type
C'mon Seymour I 'm trying to collect data here Do n't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl
Jesus
Okay what about this one Are you into girls with big tits
I really did n't get a good look at her
But putting that aside for now would you go out with her
I do n't know what kind of question is that I mean it 's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me
What about her Would you go out with her
Jesus That 's very nice of you Enid but I I really
Mark my words by the end of this summer you 'll be up to your neck in pussy
I appreciate the offer but you really do n't
I mean it You leave everything to me I 'm going to be your own personal dating service
Yeah well
I 'm totally serious
Good luck
No really I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds
Oh right
I 'm talking to you I 'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute
Yeah right If I 'm so cool why have n't I had a girlfriend in four years I ca n't even remember the last time a girl talked to me
No you 're not You 're a cool guy Seymour
You think it 's healthy to obsessively collect things You ca n't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff I 'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers
Oh come on What are you talking about
Please go ahead and kill me This stuff does n't make you happy believe me
God look at this poster I ca n't believe this room You 're the luckiest guy in the world I 'd kill to have stuff like this
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point I 've tried to pare down my collection to the essential
Wow This is like my dream room Are these all records
Yeah well sure you can if you want to it 's just I do n't want all these guys in there at once you know
Really Can I see it
Oh God no This is just junk I have for sale or trade The record room is off-limits
You 're right about that So this is your record collection
I I did n't think you would have any interest in this get together I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you it 's not like a real party or anything
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks
Hey I was only kidding
NO
Oops I dropped it
Watch my stuff
Yeah sure I guess
Do you want to see it I can run upstairs and get it
Wow
The Skip James record Yeah that 's a masterpiece There are no other records like that I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection It 's one of maybe five known copies
Yeah that 's good too the whole record was good but that one song Devil Got My Woman I mostly just keep playing that one over and over Do you have any other records like that
So you really liked it Yeah there 's some really rare performances You liked that Memphis Minnie huh
Yeah it took a while before I got a chance to play it but when I heard that song it was like
Okay
A dollar seventy-five
How much is it
Wow
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about 500 if you have the original 78 She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived and a great singer and songwriter as well I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue
Nah it 's not so great Here 's the one I 'd recommend
Is this one any good
Well there 's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff
Sure I guess
There 's some good stuff in here do you like old music
Sure Wait maybe not 78s but I can play regular records
Those are all 78s Can you play 78s
I do n't have anything after about 1935 I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection but it 's not really for sale I do n't really collect foreign
You know like weird 1960 's Indian rock n roll music
Indian records
Do you have any old Indian records
Right
Let me tell ya somethin Joe Listen to me Joe you ca n't hit a home run without swinging the bat
Do n't worry about it He 's not gettin any and neither are you
Seymour You got ta be kidding me
They 're Seymour 's
So what 's the story with the two cheerleaders over here
No problem
Yeah well thanks for cheering me up
Maybe she 's got another boyfriend
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy Who knows It could be a million things It 's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain that 's for sure
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records She could at least have the decency to call me back
Still torturing yourself over that Enid huh
Yeah I 'm really really happy Really having a good time
Well here 's where the fun never stops
Call me sometime
Yeah
Did you remember to pay the phone bill
I wish I could see him
I agree
He has every reason to freak out this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody
So Josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us
Forget it there 's no way find some other poor sucker to abuse
Please Josh
I think it 's really a wonderful piece Margaret
Right exactly
This shocking image of repressed femininity
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood because of tea parties in the olden days but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this like
Very good Now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent
It 's a found object that 's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art
I can see that now what can you tell us about it First of all what kind of sculpture is this
It 's a tampon in a teacup
What do we have here Margaret
Is n't this a wonderful piece class This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier
It 's my response to the issue of a woman 's right to choose it 's something I feel super-strongly about
Talk to us about it
I am
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class Who is responsible for this
What fake blind date What are you talking about
Did n't she ever tell you about that God she really is pathological
What are you talking about
On that pathetic fake blind date
What do you mean
Look what do you expect Considering how we met you
Did she say that
Yeah she thinks you 're a dork
Why did you say she might be hiding from me Did she say anything to you about me
That slut
Really I do n't know enough about it to
Why would n't she tell me There 's no way She could never keep that to herself you 're crazy
I have no idea I just want to
What Is she having some secret affair with Josh
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating I thought maybe she was
Why What did she tell you
I do n't know
Josh Why would she be with Josh
Maybe she 's with Josh
I do n't know where is she then
Why would she be hiding from me
Are you sure she was n't there Maybe she was just hiding from you
Uh do you mind if I wait I really need to talk to her
What the fuck is she doing She was supposed to be here three hours ago
No they said she was here
She 's not at home
Uh hi Uh Enid 's stepmother told me I 'd find her here
Do you have a check for me
Yes
Seymour
Do n't thank me You 're doing all the work
Thank you doctor
Why do n't we start with that next week
It does n't pay very much but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months Do you think that 's too soon I 'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage
Remember what I said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you
Well mostly archival research cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues It 's really I ca n't believe it
So tell me more about this job What exactly will you be doing
I have to admit things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit
careful Abdullah
at last you 're right we do you are the problem in Tsavo
I was n't and you know it and do n't push it just listen we have a problem in Tsavo
now you 're telling me my beliefs I do n't think so
that 's ridiculous talk and you ca n't seriously believe it
The next time will be as this time The Devil has come to Tsavo
As are they all
Morning friend glorious day
You think so Fine It 's best you get out Go Tell all your people to go run home where they 'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here they were the only ones to flee
He 'll replace you too that 's all you really care about
He sees this chaos he 'll replace you all
You think you matter Beaumont is on that train he matters
you do not call me a liar you know nothing of their health consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay
oh sing a different song Abdullah there 's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is
On that I choose to remain dubious Two are dead now in two nights
There is no reason for fear
Oh you 're a doctor now too
Let me see the sick
malaria epidemic very sudden
You were contracted to work
We 'll have to make them come to us wo n't we And since there are two of them we 're going to set two plans in motion First we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night
How we do n't know where they are
Starting now we attack them
I think it 's been a pleasure
Excellent decision Your name is Abdullah I 'm sure we 'll meet again Go and enjoy the splendid morning
Most certainly Absolutely Yes
Am I to take it you want to live
I am a man of peace
You 're right The Devil has come Look at me I am the Devil
You do n't know all that has happened here the Devil has come to Tsavo
No hints Samuel
not a time for modesty Bob
Understand I had help
Very well the job 's still yours I 'll go But if I have to return you 're finished And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation Am I not fair Told you you 'd hate me
Every man who 's ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him the lions will be dead
I 'm going to try and locate Redbeard I assume you 've heard of him
All they 'll bring is more chaos and we 've plenty of that already and if they come in word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then
Let me explain about time you 've been here three months and already two months behind And the Germans and the French are gearing up And I do n't care about you and I do n't care about the thirty dead I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule I 'll get my knighthood and I want it Professional hunters may be the answer
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people do n't you Well fine except there is n't a higher rated engineer and we both know that And since time is so important to you how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here
I made a mistake hiring you you 're simply not up to the job
What
In point of fact it did n't But I 'm convinced the theory is sound
And it worked
I did n't conceive of it for the lions I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger
Are you running a high fever man How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed How could you even conceive of it
Genius the beast will enter tripping the wire the door will slide down trapping him you safe behind the bars will have him at your mercy and will shoot him
In that half will be bait human bait I 'll start things off a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor
I 'm calling it my contraption we 're going to surround it with a boma a fence to you and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door
This is supposed to be salvation What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here
What have they done besides kill Starling How many have they killed
It has n't been that simple so far
what 's the surprise in that this is Africa
It 's what the natives are calling the lions two lions have been causing trouble
Well I need to speak to him
Yes he is
Awhile back he ordered some bibles I 've brought them Is he here
Starling
I do need to see Starling
But overall you 're pleased
Truthfully There has been the occasional odd hiccup but then as you so wisely told me I 'd never built in Africa
So work must be going well
Do n't they though
Lovely sound they seem happy
How could it be I hate Africa
Pleasant journey
You wo n't have the chance Any further words of encouragement Then I 've a train to catch
Very moving Patterson I 'm touched you confided in me But I do n't really give a shit about your upcoming litter I 've made you with this assignment do n't make me break you
I 've got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I 'd be with her when the baby comes
You 'll need your confidence I promise you
But I have in India every country presents problems
You 've never built in Africa
I 'm sure you 've examined my record So you know I 've never yet been late on a bridge
build the bridge over the Tsavo river And be finished in four months time Can you do that
Games Look at me closely Patterson I am a monster My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me such as yourself One mistake and I promise you this I 'll make you hate me
My wife is the game player in the family sir
John Henry Patterson come in I 'm Robert Beaumont Firm I like that tells me a lot about you now why do n't you tell me about me To get you started many people find me handsome with a wonderful smile I 'm sure you agree Winning personality heaps of charm
Then why do it
You do n't enjoy killing do you
You 're certain about tomorrow But you do n't seem excited
Karim will have to show me where it happened And of course I 'll need the donkey With any luck I 'll sort it out tonight
I know it 's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey but what are you going to do about it
Who else would hire me Beat you to it did n't I Oh yes almost forgot brought you a little welcoming gift
Then why do you stay
This sham Ridiculous Who needs it It 's only being built to control the ivory trade make men richer
You intend sorting this out tonight
please you need n't be so graphic
then he feasted on him starting with his feet
Well he got away did n't he Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them donkey took the brunt of it then suddenly the lion ran off
A man-eater attacks and you 're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it
Nigel and I do n't like each other much
You never had it
I 'm David Hawthorne this is my hospital And my advice to you is do n't get sick in front of it That was meant to be charming sorry I seem to have lost the knack
Then we agree
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived
I suppose I could answer you I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting what with the smell of blood and flesh that they have to strike It 's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they 're already contemplating feasting here But I do n't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I do n't have the least idea what I am doing that I am nothing but an incompetent that I am a fool Anyone who finds me a fool please say so now
Silliest thing I ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that
is it I 'm sorry but then of course you 're the doctor you should know
That 's a terrible idea
I am desperate to see Africa but I hate the leaving
Go now Such a gentleman
not what if there will be there always are Which only means that our son and I note my confidence will have an excuse to come visit
What if there are complications
oh please if I 'd been against your taking this you would have abandoned me You 've been desperate to see Africa your whole life
well it 's just other men do n't abandon their wives at such a time
Oh dear you 're geting that downtrodden look again
It was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments
Tell me about Beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are how lucky he is to have you
We 're not much good at goodbyes Helena
I tried to be late John it would have been easier if you 'd gone
COOLIE I assure you we came close many times
well of course he kept moving but he could n't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing
COOLIE I would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving
Not once you did n't hit it once
COOLIE That is correct Nothing
All right you 'll spend your nights inside You 'll have plenty of ammunition You 're totally protected you have really nothing to fear
COOLIE We have hunted since childhood
Very good indeed
We all worked together Worthy deeds were accomplished I liked the labor My mother insisted on piano lessons broke the dear woman 's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands I like the blood is that strange
You mean nobody died
What a good week
But it 's crazy the lion should n't be that hungry this soon Samuel
far end of camp man wandering alone at night Hawthorne 's examining the body now There 's even less of him than of Singh
Second death Where
That 's what the books say
But you said they were always old
I 'll try but this feels so different that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh 's size
Nigel you 'll just have to use your hands
John it will not be easy
In your honor Nigel And you and Singh will be in charge of building them and you 'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and you 'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there
All right thee second embankment will go there
Possibly
Are n't we full of ourselves today I think it 's because of the lion
How lucky we are
true enough but without the comedy relief
With much more on the way John we could have had this chat on flatter ground
So that 's what a lion looks like
one shot
Not to terrify you Nigel but it 's worse than you think I 've never even seen one
Since you 'd only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions
What
John I know this is n't the time to ask but
That is precisely my plan but back in my tent
you 'll have to deal with it Nigel
I 'm sure you mean that to be comforting but
Shhh
I hate to be a bother John but the cramp 's getting worse The pain is actually quite unbearable now
Well why not You seem so calm and experienced Why not indeed
I 'd love the company And I 've hunted all my life
I 've never been all that adventurous I would n't be in the way
Might be exciting for you
I do n't suppose I could watch
We know three things about man-eaters First they always return to where they 've attacked before Second they 're always old they ca n't catch other animals so they turn to us And third they 're always alone they 've been cast out by their pride because they ca n't keep up
You said of course you 'd need the donkey Why of course
Well he put me in a spot did n't he But that 's all right after all I 'm responsible for everything that happens here And it certainly wo n't do much for morale if a man-eater 's on the prowl
I could n't believe it when you said sort it out As if it were the most normal thing in the world Ho-hum what lovely tea I think I 'll bag a killer beast this evening nothing much else going on anyway
Yes but their suffering is only transitory once they except God into their hearts He will vanquish all pain
And anxious to get started What is this mostly malaria
Finish your tour
I 've got medical supplies to deliver Come along to the hospital when you 're done
Excellent Could I see the bridge site
Does he speak English
Samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts
Have you got that in writing
We all have our reasons Mine is simply to make them understand happiness accept salvation know the serenity that comes best I stop One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring But I know God smiles on me
Beaumont says it 's to end slavery
Every time I see something like that I know we 're right to be here to bring Christianity into their lives enrich their souls
Almost three hours But I 've been getting ready all my life
I 've lived in Africa a year and I do n't know what you know How long have you been here
Just that they fart through their mouths Must make kissing something of a gamble
Anything special about them
The females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they would n't survive because the males eat the young
Do n't much like them
That I know Robert seems dreadful but when you truly get to know the man well he 's much worse And I 'm one of his defenders Forget him for now it 's your first ride to Tsavo I think you 'll find it breathtaking
He just gave me his monster speech
Many thanks You 're Patterson yes Nigel Starling I 'll be assisting you at Tsavo but surely Beaumont must have told you that
Actually I could have done it much more easily without you but for whatever reason I 'm glad you came
Understood you realize now you could never have done it without me
I never thought I 'd say this but I 'm glad you came
The most of any lions a hundred Probably more Johnny
How many do you think they 've killed
Because I think they 're after you
Why
Good luck
You think they 'll come then Why
It 's certainly the best chance they 've had to kill you
Was that supposed to make me feel better
I ca n't control mine I 'd be lost without the shame factor driving me
I 'll have to
Yes And I 'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever Can you control your fear
I 'll be bait alone
Not for me I 'm too bulky and it 's your idea you go up there Take the others to the water tower for the night
They 're used to people in trees not in a clearing It may be tight
Do n't they have to be
Where could it have gone How could it get across the water They 're only lions yes
Nobody 's seen anything like this Lions do n't have caves like this they 're doing it for pleasure
Their den Have you ever seen anything like this
I got big
What happened to them
In my town when I was little there was a brute a bully who terrorized the place But he was not the problem He had a brother who was worse than he But the brother was not the problem One or the other of them was usually in jail The problem came when they were both free togther The two became different from either alone Alone they were only brutes Together they became lethal together they killed
You just got hit The getting up is up to you but they 're only lions and I 'm going after them crack of dawn
It would have been a beautiful bridge John I never noticed before occupied with other business I suppose never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I 've had the time today nothing else on and this it 's graceful and the placement could n't be prettier and
In point of fact it didn't but I 'm convinced the idea is sound
But of course yours worked
Meant to ask you the railroad car trap Your idea Excellent notion I used the same device myself once
It 's all right Stay ready They know it 's there
Goddammit
Only in life
Have you ever failed
Think about something else
do n't know
Has it ever done that before
misfire it jammed
You 'd never force the lion to me and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck Around there 's a clearing you 'll know it from the anthills get there and hide and listen to the sounds I 'll make the lion come directly to you
It was probably luck I 'd rather you did the shooting
Samuel says you killed a lion
I can try
The best way to ensure the kill when you 're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter Have you ever led trackers
No but you do see you were needed after all And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn
Have you got it
I 'm always considerate my mother taught me that
That 's very considerate
I do n't really But understand something even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out when I 'm gone you 'll still have to build the bridge And I do n't want the men to have lost respect for you
Somehow I guessed
All right let 's go into battle I 'm Redbeard
Actually no
Let me save time you are the engineer you are in charge you 're sorry I 'm here Right so far Good because I am not an engineer I do n't want to be in charge and I 'm sorrier than you are that I 'm here I hate Tsavo So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave See any problems
We need to talk
Nonsense Samuel would have done something
Got me out of trouble
What did I do
I did n't have a chance to thank you
It 's all right Samuel we all get hit
Afraid of lions
Underneath Somewhere
Where is it
Once
He has children
I feel the same about the bridge This country certainly did n't ask for it does n't need it
Three years I 've worked for the railroad Now I do n't know why It seemed a good idea once
He does n't He needs nobody But we have hunted many times he knows I am afraid of lions
Thank you Why does he need you by him
Since his beard was red
You 've known him long
Oh yes But it takes time
You like him do n't you
I have to ask why do you need me
Soon
You give me hope John
I do actually very much
Do you love her
I expect so it 's from my wife
Good news
Thank you Samuel
For you
Look out Samuel here it comes
Oh yes I think so
Fine Get started And a strict curfew no one allowed out at night Send half your men to the bridge the rest with these two And I 'm sorry for my tone earlier But I repeat there is no reason for fear I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area Fires burning at night
You do n't know what Tsavo means do you It means slaughter
Nonsense
You they can not believe you 're still here
What are they looking at
Clearly you do n't agree about building the railroad
I am also liaison between these two
This is more difficult
Did it look like this in your mind
Get on They detest each other Obviously the Africans hate the Indians But the Indians also hate the other Indians Some of them worship cows while others eat them
The workers do n't get on
Thank you The truth is this you have to work at it constantly
It 's all wonderfully under control Samuel you 've done a splendid job
Because they are here Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world Come John to the bridge
Why do the workers look unhappy
Hold your son high
Some mysteries should not have solutions
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity Was that worth all the lives Too soon to tell
Help finish the railroad
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas You
Where do you go next
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers and by the time we 're done I promise you the odor of blood will be irresistible
And where will you sleep beautifully
Gentlemen there 's no sickness smell at all here and little blood When we leave close the gate securely do n't open it til morning and keep your fires high Any questions ask them now You two will sleep beautifully in your tents And stay there
Not even close What happened
Did you ever see a lion that size
Because I have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men
Why so many
They will want a lot of money
Four should do it
How many cattle
I do n't believe you had a mother
Why do you laugh you do n't believe she taught me
I 'd rather not
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other Think about it
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul I could never forgive what you 've done to me and my child
I know Marry me Dana and together we will raise Vigo as our son There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god I 'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment And perhaps a car and free parking
We do n't have a relationship
Time is running out Dana Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine and Vigo 's Well mainly Vigo 's But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship
I do n't care who he is He 's not taking my baby
Not in this case my dear Take a look That 's not Gainsborough 's Blue Boy up there He 's Vigo
Everybody has a choice
I do n't believe we have the luxury of choice
If this is what the world will be like I do n't want to live in it
No harm will come to the child You might even say it 's a privilege He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo And you well you will be the mother of the ruler of the world Does n't that sound nice
What do you want with my baby
Oh I 'm sorry This is Peter Venkman Peter Janosz Poha
Dana are n't you going to introduce me to your friend
Good night Janosz
Okay just thought I 'd check Good night Dana Sleep well Do n't let the bedbugs bite you
No everything 's fine Honestly Thanks anyway
Do you need anything You want me to come in
Hello Dana I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I 'd stop by to see if everything 's all right with you you know with the blackout and everything Are you okay Is the baby all right
Janosz
Okay I 'll take a raincheck on that
I 'm sorry Perhaps some other time
Every day I ask you and every day you 've got something else to do Do I have bad breath or something
Actually I 'm not eating lunch today I have an appointment In fact I 'd better go
We 'll be very sorry to lose you Perhaps I could take you to lunch today
Thank you Janosz I 've learned a lot here but now that my baby 's a little older I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra
You know you are really doing very good work here I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations
Oh yes I got in a little late this morning Janosz
Thank you
I wo n't
Egon I 'd rather you did n't mention any of this to Peter if you do n't mind
Certainly
This is my address and telephone number Will you call me
No Not that I can recall
Does he ever mention me
Venkman I think he was borderline for a while there Then he crossed the border
How is he these days
Occasionally
Do you ever see him
Oh no
Okay whatever you think but not Venkman
We 'll do the happiness index next I 'd like to bring Ray in on your case if it 's all right with you
I 'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field It 's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters
What are you working on Egon
I 'm not saying you did In science we always look for the simplest explanation
Hundreds of people Believe me I did n't imagine this
That 's exactly what you said last week
Okay that 's no problem
No you did n't Frank
Did n't I do it
Thank you Frank Oh are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom I asked you last week
That 's a good-looking kid you got there Ms Barrett
Hiya Oscar What do you say slugger
Thank you Frank I 'll get the hang of this eventually
Okay okay It 's not my job but what the hell I 'll do you a favor He takes the grocery bags from her
You 're also a human being Frank
I 'm not a doorman Miss Barrett I 'm a building superintendent
Frank do you think you could give me a hand with these bags
So what It 's a free country Thanks Lib
That 's a terrible thing to say
Same difference
That 's not true It was 1620
Finally came to your senses huh
I think he likes you I think I do too
Do n't worry Janine has a very special way with children
Maybe I should call Janine
Let me jingle you right now
So why do n't you give me a jingle in the year 2000
Thank you If I had that kind of support on a daily basis I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century
Why do you say things like that You 're so much better than you know
I 'm not even good for me
Oh Peter I did n't dump you I just had to protect myself You really were n't very good for me you know
All right you want to be real So tell me why did you dump me
For one night in your life do you think it 's possible for us to be completely real
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow or could you hold off for a few days maybe
I want to stop getting involved with men who are n't good for me
So are you making any New Year 's resolutions
I have a hamper Next time ask me first okay I have more than two grades of laundry There 're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty
I put them in your hamper I thought they were dirty
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here
Okay but it 's not a date It 's a dinner
Janine Melnitz are you kidding Do I have a vase I brought some of your clothes Wear something intriguing I brought along some interesting possibilities
Does she know anything about babies
It 's Janine Melnitz from my staff She 's one of my most valuable employees
I 'm not here to date I ca n't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I do n't know
Now you get dressed and we go out I got a babysitter and everything Trust me you need it
They did n't find anything In the bathtub the pink ooze nothing So what do I do now
Yes I 'm very clean Did they find anything at my apartment
Are you all squeaky clean now
I 'll put him down for you You are way too short And your belly-button sticks out You 're nothing but a burden to your poor mother
Thank you Poor baby I think I should put him down now
Or we could do that
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby
For me it 's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me If we go the other way I 'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night
Really And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements
Be careful on that sofa it 's a butt-biter But the bed 's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired feel free In fact I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here
Peter this is very nice but you do n't have to do any of this you know
Bathroom 's right here let me just tidy up a few things
Sounds like another slime job No they 're all right They 're here now Right Let me know
It was full of this awful pink ooze
We 'll take care of that Ray Pete Listen get over to Dana 's right away Her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid
Peter what about the bathtub
This is Joe Namath 's old number you know You could get a lot of chicks with this Just do n't pee in it
I 'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub You better stay here
I do n't know what to do anymore
Who could blame him Were you wearing this nightgown
I must be losing my mind At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me
You know if anyone else told me that I 'd have serious doubts But coming from you I ca n't honestly say I 'm surprised
Peter the bathtub tried to eat Oscar
No I just got in a couple hours ago Come on in Are we having a pajama party
I 'm sorry Were you on your way out
I 'd like to stay but I really do n't have time to hang around here I 'll call you Later Johnny
Good-bye Peter
I may be wrong but I think you 've got a little crush on this guy
Yeah it 's not the kind of thing you 'd want to hang in the rec room You know what it needs A fluffy little white kitten in the corner
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman I hate this painting I 've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage
As a matter of fact I stopped by to tell you that I have n't forgotten your problem and that we 're still on the case
I 'm sure you did n't come here just to talk about art
I did n't paint it I 'm just cleaning it It 's an original Ver Meer It 's worth about ten million dollars
You 're really good you know
Oh hello Peter
So this is what you do huh
Thanks
Good luck
I 'm El Gato I always land on my feet
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug
Do n't worry about me I 'm like a cat
Please do n't say that You wo n't go to prison
You are personally responsible If I can get conjugal rights will you visit me at Sing Sing
I wish I could stay I feel personally responsible for you being here
Okay let 's take a look
That 's where the buggy stopped
We definitely had a moment or two
Brings back a lot of sweet memories does n't it There 's our old cash machine And the dry cleaners we used to go to And the old video store We really had some good times did n't we
I 'll supervise
I 'll do it
Unusual I do n't know I have n't had a lot of experience with babies
Peter this is serious I need to know if you think there 's anything unusual about him
Oscar You poor kid
His name is Oscar
There 's no doubt about it He 's got his father 's looks The kid is ugly extremely ugly And smelly You stink It 's just horrible You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled What 's his name
What do you think
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional
Well when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain that 's when I left
Men are very sensitive you know We need to feel loved and desired too
You never asked me and every time I brought it up you 'd get drowsy and fall asleep
He ditched you You should 've married me you know
He did n't ditch me We had some problems he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it
So what happened to Mr Right I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe
I can see that you 're still very bitter about us but in the interest of science I 'm going to give it my best shot Let 's go to work boys
I have That 's why I did n't call you first
You know Dana I 'm very very hurt that you did n't call me first I 'm still into all this stuff you know Have n't you ever seen my show
Hello Peter
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
Sorry
Peter do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things
I think we hit the honeypot boys There 's something brewing under the street
A little to the left Right there That 's where it stopped
Is this the spot
Hi Egon
No problem Always glad to help and hug
Hi Ray It 's good to see you Thanks for coming
No you ca n't and I think that 's the whole problem with aliens you just ca n't trust them You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard Anyway we 're just about out of time Next week on 'World of the Psychic hairless pets Until then this is Peter Venkman saying Good night
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn I ca n't be sure Peter
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn
I received this information from an alien I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that 's where he told me about the end of the world
Valentine 's Day That 's got to be a bummer Where did you get that date Elaine
According to my sources the world will end on February 14 in the year 2016
Oh you think so Well I 've got news for you You 've got Dracula 's brother-in-law in there and he 's got my girlfriend and her kid Around about midnight tonight when you 're partying uptown this guy 's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants And that 's just round one
Look I 've had it with you Get your stuff together get back in that clown car and get out of here This is a city matter and everything 's under control
Now you 're talking
Before you go running to the newspapers with this would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown
Yeah I think the Times might be interested do n't you The Post might have a lot of fun with it too
That 's quite a story
Look you stay away from the mayor Next fall barring a disaster he 's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends You read me
No that 's what I want to talk to the mayor about We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you
I know who you are Doctor Venkman Busting any ghosts lately
I 'm an old friend of the mayor 's I just want to say hello to him
I 'm Jack Hardemeyer I 'm the mayor 's assistant What can I do for you
Yeah you can get your hand off my chest
Can I help you
You 're very brave Louis Good luck
Oh yeah sure no But there 's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum
I 'm not sure this is such a good idea Do they know you 're doing this
You 're right We should stay
I do n't think we should leave her alone
Should we go
Tonight
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me I 'd like to have a baby myself Would n't you
Okay
You 're really good with children Louis I can tell Why do n't you come here and sit with me
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services which was a good deal for all of them because then they did n't have to withhold tax and social security which I 'm not saying is right but it 's just a story so I guess it 's all right I can finish this later if you 're tired
It 's really not a bad place It just needs a woman 's touch
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them
I ca n't believe a person could actually live like this
Oh sure that sounds great
I 'd like to but I told Dr Venkman I 'd babysit Do you want to babysit with me
Janine do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home
Well good night Louis
That 's very practical I hate going out on New Year 's Eve too
No I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first That way I beat the crowds
Have you made any plans yet You know tomorrow is New Year 's Eve
Oh no it 's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you 're already an accountant
I was trying to get that smelly green thing The guys asked me to help out I 'm like the fifth Ghostbuster
What are you doing up here
Oh migod I 'm sorry I did n't mean to do that It was an accident
Ghostbusters
Who are you going to call
Do n't worry We 're not moving He is
It 's that darn ghost again I do n't know what to do anymore He just wo n't leave us alone I guess we 'll just have to move
What is it honey
Oh Johnny Did you back the wrong horse
You pitiful miserable creatures You dare to challenge the power of darkness Do n't you realize what you are dealing with He 's Vigo You are like the buzzing of flies to him
Not Do n't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities We 'll be back
So you see everything is in order is it not
I 'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory If she says it looked at her it looked at her Hey you Vigie Look at me I 'm talking to you Hey Look at me when I 'm talking to you
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio People start imagining things
This is the one that looked at Dana
The Upper West Side
You know I never got to ask you Where you from Johnny
We got a major creep alert and we 're just going down the list Your name was first
Then why have you come
I know
Dr Venkman Dana is not here
My pleasure
I 'll let you get back to it Nice meeting you
Well I 'd make an exception in this case if I were you
We do n't go around altering valuable paintings Dr Venkman

Too bad for the Moldavians
It 's a painting I 'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition It 's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo the Carpathian He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century
How are you What 's that you 're working on Johnny
Pleasure to meet you I 've seen you on television
So be it On this the day of darkness she will be ours wife to you and mother to me
Lord Vigo the mother Dana is fine and strong I was wondering well would it be possible if I bring the baby could I have the woman
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year Bring me the child that I might live again
I await the word of Vigo
I command you
the sorrow
the sorrow of Moldavia
Yes the scourge
I Vigo the scourge of Carpathia
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain I sat on a throne of blood What was will be what is will be no more Now is the season of evil Find me a child that I might live again
Command me lord
I Vigo the scourge of Carpathia the sorrow of Moldavia command you
You 've got to stop them Please
These boys are n't playing around
Maybe they just want to appeal
They 're the Scoleri Brothers I tried them for murder They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48 Now they want to kill me
Who are they
You 've got to do something
Sorry your Honor but when somebody sets me up like that I ca n't resist
Keep that up mister and I 'll find you in contempt
Did I forget something
That 's it That 's all you have to say
Your honor ladies and gentlemen of the audience I do n't think it 's fair to call my clients frauds Okay the blackout was a big problem for everybody I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time but I do n't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me Thank you
Get on with it counselor
Can I have some of your water
Yes
Your honor may I approach the bench
Do I
Sustained Mr Tully do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case
Okay let me rephrase that question Did n't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children
The witness is leading him Sustained
I let them handle all the little stuff I just come in on the big ones
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster
Hey Wait Okay I 'll meet you there
Hi it 's really great to meet you guys I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that
This is my cousin Sherman Sherm say hello to the Ghostbusters I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out
Then you should go to the police I do n't believe in any of that stuff
I 'm telling you we 're all going to be in big trouble if we do n't do something fast That ghost guy came and took my friend 's baby and we got to get it back It 's just a scared little baby Sherm
Yeah I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year Forget it Louis I could get in a lot of trouble
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out did n't she
You were the one who got me in
I got you out of those bad tax shelters
Like what
Sherman I 've done lots of favors for you
I 'm a dermatologist I ca n't write orders on the psych ward
Why ca n't you just have them released You 're a doctor
I ca n't do it Louis It is n't ethical I could lose my license
Come on Sherm You 're my cousin Do this for me I 'm begging you
Well for your sake I hope you 're right But I think my other guest may disagree with you Elaine you had another date in mind
This is not just some money-making scheme I did n't just make up the date I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year 's Eve
This year That 's cutting it a little close is n't it I mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right So you 're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year And it 's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year 's Eve
Okay so can you tell us when it 's going to happen or do we have to buy the book
Well I think it 's important for people to know that the world is in danger
Hi welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic I 'm Peter Venkman and I 'm chatting with my guest author lecturer and of course psychic Milton Anglund Milt your new book is called The End of the World Is n't that kind of like writing about gum disease Yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it
No I guess I 'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it
So what are you saying That the world of the supernatural is your special province
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in but I 'm going to tell you the truth There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding things that ca n't be explained and that most people do n't want to know about anyway That 's where we come in
I 'll ask you again Dr Venkman Why were you digging the hole And please remember that you 're under oath
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we did n't think anyone would notice
So Dr Venkman please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street
Objection Irrelevant and immaterial
Yes I did We were city champs
Ostrov I 've been there Good party town
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland
From where Neptune
It 's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country
Pretty impressive huh
I 'm worried The vibrations could shake her to pieces We should have padded her feet
So far so good
They love you Lib Keep it up
It 's working The positive GeV 's are climbing
This wo n't wait until tomorrow Venkman It 's hot and it 's ready to pop
Boys listen You 're scaring the straights Let 's save this until tomorrow okay
Roach breeding Sounds better and better Dana The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead
You know animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population
It 's a rough translation from the Moldavian
That 's it I 'll be back
A hundred and five years He really hung on did n't he
Vigo the Carpathian born 1505 died 1610
You need the exercise
You were supposed to help me with this
I knew that
That 's a thousand million electron volts
Finding something abnormal on the street should n't be too hard
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street
What now Brainiac
Yeah you would Is that for personal or professional reasons
I 'd like to have a stool specimen
I do n't even want to know where that is
I think they 're more interested in my epididymis
How 've you been How 's teaching I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours huh
Hello Venkman
Egon
Do it Just do it
Do n't shoot You 'll hit Ray
Something good
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us
We need something that everyone can get behind a symbol
I ca n't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there 's no way back Sure it 's crowded it 's dirty it 's noisy And there are too many people who 'd just as soon step on your face as look at you But there 've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg We just have to mobilize it
It wo n't work There 's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell
Butt out you pencil-necked geek I 've had it with you
If you two are looking for a fight you got one Who wants it first Come on Ray Try me sucker
Nine feet ten
That 's it It 's on the bottom
Six feet seven eight
This guy was a bad monkey He dabbled in all the Black Arts and listen to this prophecy Just before his head died his last words were Death is but a door time is but a window I 'll be back
No not exactly a man of the people Also known as Vigo the Cruel Vigo the Torturer Vigo the Despised and Vigo the Unholy
And we 're the
I 'm Egon
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source
Hey I did n't imagine it There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there
His nickname is The Hammer
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy huh
What 's the reading
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole
The New York Pneumatic Railway It was an experimental subway system Fan-forced air-trains built around 1870
Why do n't we try the Giga-meter
Nothing Not a trace
Good idea
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis
This one 's interesting Berlin 1939 a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground Three hundred eyewitnesses
Some crank Looking for goat hooves Come up with anything
Who was that
There 's something very familiar about this painting
Late Renaissance I think Caravaggio or Brunelleschi
And it 's all flowing toward the museum
Rivers of the stuff
No the slime is rising
Is the line sinking
I 'd put my money on that Vigo character
There 's definitely something going on in that studio The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes
We 've found it at every event site we 've been to lately
Me I 'm a little of everything Some Irish some German some French Dutch the women in my family slept around And that 's what made this country great
What 's your story Pete
Oh right you told me that They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese as I recall How about you Winston
My great-grandparents were Swiss I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived
Yeah and a lot easier to get to than that island
I think she looks pretty good here do n't you
The whole city 's together on this one We took a vote Everybody 's down on you you know
Vigi Vigi Vigi you have been a bad little monkey
She 's new in town
My Fault
We 're almost there Lib Step on it
I do n't think they make Nikes in her size
Are you kidding We 'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th I 'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth Trust me I used to drive a cab
I 'll keep to the middle of the channel We 're okay to 59th Street then we 'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th
Only one way to find out Ready Teddy
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job
Good effort Now what Should we say supportive nurturing things to it Ray
Forget it The Vienna Boys Choir could n't get through this stuff
I hate Jello
It looks like a giant Jello mold
It 's all over the city Pete well under it actually
Yeah sorry I missed it I guess you guys did n't know about the dress code here It 's really kind of a coat and tie place
You should 've been there Venkman Absolutely incredible
Okay but you 're missing all the fun
I think we 're going to have to pass on the sewer trip boys Let me know what you find out
Darn it I wish I 'd known you were going I 'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations
We 're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow We thought you might want to come along
Do n't tell me let me guess All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver 's license
What happened
I 'll get one more reading
Beautiful beautiful Work with me baby Just have fun with it Okay he 's playing it cool Let 's finish up and get out of here
Nothing Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger 's Magicians Martyrs and Madmen Listen to this
Did you find anything at Dana 's
You 're not sleeping with this stuff are you
Well we sing to it we talk to it we say supportive nurturing things
What kind of tests
We 're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction
Like a goat on garbage
'Mood slime We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it
This is an incredible breakthrough Venkman A psychoreactive substance Whatever this is it clearly responds to human emotional states
This is what you do with your spare time
No I 'm just restoring it to its normal state
And now you 're going to eat it
It 's not that thing you do with your nostrils is it
Oh good you 're here Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you
If he was n't dead he 'd be an Olympic prospect
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes
I guess so Pete because that 's not all Tell them what else we 've got Egon
Hold on Ray Half-price Have you gone crazy
Careful Winston He 's a mean one And to celebrate our grand reopening we 're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back service plan
I 'm Peter
I 'm Ray
Okay let 's heat 'em up
Geez I forgot how heavy these things are
Relax We 're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet low key no profile
Hey hey hey stresshound Are you nuts If anybody found out about this we 'd be in serious trouble The judge could n't have been clearer no ghostbusting
I love this We 're onto something really big I can smell it Ray We 're going to make some headlines with this one
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs giga electron volts
What 's that
It 's an interesting one Pete If anything was going on it 's totally subdued now
Well Holmes what do you think
Dana Dana Barrett
Who Ray
Aaah Nobody I ca n't tell you
Who Who Who
Oh Ray

I knew that voice sounded familiar What 's up How 's it going
So no goat hooves huh
Oh hiya Pete
Oh hello perhaps you could help me I 'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request
Groovy I 've never felt better in my life
Ray Ray How do you feel man
I 've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty Now I finally get here and we 're taking her out for a walk
She 's moving
Do n't you see It 's the slime That stuff is like pure concentrated evil
What are we doing Ray I was ready to kill you
Oh yeah Anytime anytime Just go ahead and try it
You better watch your mouth man or I 'll punch your lights out
Look Zeddemore it was n't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line
Nice going Ray What were you trying to do drown me
Yeah I guess so It was the strangest thing I knew what I was doing but I could n't stop This really terrible feeling came over me and I do n't know I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all Whew Sorry boys
Are you all right
Well do n't think
No I just thought
Are you telling me how to drive
No I 'm fine I just got light-headed for a second there Let 's go
Are you all right You coming down with something

You got a flux and a half
I guess he was n't too popular at the end there
And he did n't die of old age either He was poisoned stabbed shot hung stretched disemboweled drawn and quartered
It likes all the sappy stuff 'Cumbaya 'Everything is Beautiful 'It 's a Small World but it loves Jackie Wilson
Does it have any favorites
Yeah but what a ride You ca n't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow
Yeah what did we do Ray The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae After all we did for this city
Give it up Ray You 're living in the past Ghostbusters does n't exist anymore In a year these kids wo n't even remember who we are
Come on Winston We ca n't quit now The holidays are coming up It 's our best season

I do n't think so I 'm busy Thursday night
I 'm checking on that I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it
What 's he doing in my refrigerator
Gozer he was very big in the Sumerian religion One of their gods
Hittites the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians Zuul was the Minion of Gozer
Well the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C by the What 's that say
You must have gotten the last copy
I 'll cancel the reservation I found the name Zuul in The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects I do n't suppose you 've read it
Ca n't you tell me now
Yes but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant
He is a very close friend Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment
Is he dying or something
The stiff He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man
Who 's the stiff
I know You 're quite a celebrity these days Are you here because you have info about my case
I do n't have to take abuse from you I have other people dying to give it to me

All right What do you want to do
I 'm a qualified psychologist I 've got a degree and everything I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it
Thanks Coming from you that really means a lot to me
If it 's any comfort to you I do n't think you 're crazy
This is terrible Either there 's a monster in my kitchen or I 'm completely crazy
There 's nothing there now and I do n't get any significant readings
Yeah yeah
Are you all right
Damn
I know It happened by itself
I told you I
You 're quite a housekeeper
I 'll wait here if you do n't mind
Well let 's check it out
Uh-huh
Nothing Is that the kitchen
What
That 's too bad
Thanks What 's in there
Like a used car salesman
No What do I act like
You really do n't act like a scientist
Yeah but it 's got a great cello break
That 's a violin concerto
I 'd have to say Prokofiev 's third concerto
Really Do you have a favorite piece
You play the cello It 's my favorite instrument
No If I moved out now I 'd be acknowledging that what happened was real I 'm not ready to do that
Have you ever thought of moving out at least until this disturbance blows over
Spengler see if you can find the word Zuul in any of the literature I 'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment
No just that one word Zuul but I have no idea what it means
It 's in the stars
Is that your professional opinion
Some people like the attention Some people are just crazy
Why would anyone make up a thing like that
So what do you think it was
and then I opened the door again but it was gone There was nothing there
Barrett Dana Barrett
We 're all professionals here Miss
Yes well I 'm not sure What I have to say may sound a little unusual
Hello I 'm Peter Venkman May I help you
I see
YAEGER Dr Venkman we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind You however seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable You 're a poor scientist Dr Venkman and you have no place in this department or in this University
But why The students love us
YAEGER Fine This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group 's activities
This is preposterous I demand an explanation
YAEGER No we 're moving you OFF CAMPUS The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant You are to vacate these premises immediately
I trust you 're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus
BUM That would definitely explain it
BUM I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area
BUM You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street
BUM Yeah it 's some kind of mallow-type substance that 's for sure
BUM Well that definitely looks like marshmallow to me
BUM Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel I think
BUM He 's a big one You do n't want to mess with that particular breed
BUM That is one speedy mutt
We 'll get back to you
LIBRARIAN Did you see it What was it
Back off man I 'm a scientist
LIBRARIAN What 's that got to do with it
One thing at a time We do n't even know what it is yet
LIBRARIAN Thank you for coming I 'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly
Yes I 'm Dr Venkman and this is Dr Stantz
LIBRARIAN Hello I 'm Roger Delacorte the Head Librarian Are you the men from the University
Thank you
Keep it anyway I have another one at home
I do n't believe in luck
It 's a souvenir from the 1964 World 's Fair at Flushing Meadow It 's my lucky coin
What is it
I want you to have this
That 's so romantic
I do n't care I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void
In the physical sense
Die in what sense
Egon there 's something very strange about that man I 'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you I 'm afraid you 're going to die
Remind me not to go to lunch with you
I think it 's the food of the future
Oh that 's very unusual
I collect spores molds and fungus
It 's a great game You should play sometime I bet you 'd be good You seem very athletic Do you have any hobbies
Is that a game
That 's very fascinating to me I read a lot myself Some people think I 'm too intellectual But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time I also play racketball Do you ever play
Print is dead
You 're very handy I can tell I bet you like to read a lot too
Oh really Well I 've quit better jobs than this one believe me
Janine I 'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry
I did n't ask him All I know is that I have n't had a break in two weeks and you promised you 'd hire more help
The EPA What 's he want
And someone from the EPA is here to see you
Here are tonight 's calls
Here 's the paper on the Brooklyn job She paid with a Visa card
What calls
Why do n't you step into the office and we 'll talk about it Hold all my calls Janine
Yes sir Do n't worry We handle this kind of thing all the time
Heavens no The owners do n't like us to even talk about it I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight
Did you ever report it to anyone
Well most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor The disturbances I mean But it 's been quiet for years Up until two weeks ago It was never ever this bad though
Has this ever happened before
Thank you for coming so quickly The guests are starting to ask questions and I 'm running out of excuses
or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions
That 's Peck
Mr Mayor it 's a pretty simple choice You can believe Mr Pecker here
Probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the Army
The man is a psychopath Your Honor
See They are using drugs
You turned off the power Look there was another man here You have to find him and bring him back A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie
Forget it Venkman You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me Now it 's my turn smart-ass
At ease Officers I 'm Peter Venkman I think there 's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can
Hey Make yourself useful Go save a tree
Have it your way Mr Venkman
Go ahead Get a court order Then I 'm gon na sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution
Well because I 'm curious I want to know more about what you do here Frankly there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation For instance the storage of noxious possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement Now either you show me what 's down there or I come back with a court order
Why do you want to see it
May I please see the storage facility
The magic word is please
And what is the magic word Mr Venkman
Because you did n't say the magic word
And why not Mr Venkman
No you may not
And may I see this storage facility
Yes it would
And would this storage facility be located on these premises
In a storage facility
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them
I 'm not at liberty to say
And how many ghosts have you caught Mr Venkman
You could say that
I see And now you catch ghosts
I have Ph.D 's in psychology and parapsychology
Exactly what are you a doctor of Mr Venkman
Yes I 'm Doctor Venkman
Are you Peter Venkman
Great How 's it going
I 'm Walter Peck I represent the Environmental Protection Agency Third District
Can I help you
Then my theory was correct
I 'll tell you the effect It pisses me off
I 'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability
Yeah but I did n't know you were going to give me electric shocks What are you trying to prove
You volunteered did n't you Are n't we paying you for this
Hey I 'm getting a little tired of this
Sorry This is n't your day
Two wavy lines
Well just 75 more to go What 's this one
Yes I do n't like this
Nervous
Close but definitely wrong
Circle
Good guess but no
A square
All right What is it
PUNK Wow
On Earth no But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna
PUNK Wait Wait Let me ask you something If you like shot Superman with those guns would he feel it or what
I could n't do that You might hurt someone
PUNK Yeah yeah I just want to see 'em
They 're not guns They 're particle throwers
PUNK Hey Mister Can I see those guns
When you were in the bathroom did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly
You 're a regular Sherlock Holmes Now what do you want
The wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating
What on earth gave you that idea
Were you recently in the bathroom
Yes
But it 's my favorite state
Life is just a state of mind
No You said crossing the beams would be BAD It 'll kill her And us
No Them Shoot them Cross the beams
On the count of three One Two
Full-stream with strogon pulse
What now
Get a grip on yourself Egon I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor
You talked to Gozer
Gozer
Who
She said he was the Destructor
Yes After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive And he was n't alone He had close to a thousand followers when he died They conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world
Let me guess Gozer Worshippers
Of course Ivo Shandor I saw his name in Tobin 's SPIRIT GUIDE He started a secret society in 1920
Oh shit
Where 's the Keymaster
If you turn that thing off we wo n't be responsible for the consequences
He wants to shut down the storage grid
All right Peter Good night
I 'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning
All right I 'll try
You have to keep him there Do whatever you have to but do n't let him leave He could be very dangerous
I agree
Yeah yeah I was just thinking It probably would n't be a good idea for them to get together at this point
Some I just met the Keymaster He 's here with me now Venkman Are you there
I do n't think so It 's more of that Gozer thing She says she 's the Gatekeeper Does that make any sense to you
Does she want to be
I 'm with Dana Barrett and she 's floating three feet off the bed
What is it
It 's Peter Egon I 've got a problem
It 's hard to explain but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension
What do you mean bad
Trust me It will be bad
Why not
Do n't cross the beams
What
Wait Wait There 's something I forgot to tell you
Yeah I can smell it
Something was definitely here
Did n't see anything Did n't get anything Nice girl no ghost I 'm starting to worry You said your graph was pointing to something big You told me things were going to start popping
Did you see anything
She 's telling the truth or at least she thinks she is
Generally you do n't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance What do you think Egon
Will you guys relax We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams
Just for your information Ray the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over 75,000
Wow
I 'm always serious
Spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost
Egon somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head Do you remember that
Oh this is big Peter This is very big There 's definitely something here
What have you got Egon
Oh You 're here
That appears to be the case
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out
And look at this Peter Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores
Look at the structure of the roof cap It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies
The storage facility blew This one shut off the protection grid
What happened
I 'm worried Ray It 's getting crowded in there And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom
I need two new purge valves How 's the grid around the storage facility holding up
I 've got to sleep
Neutronize System shut
Set entry grid
Easy Easy I 'm going to throw in my trap now
It 's working
God it 's ugly
Ray Where are you Are you all right
We 'd better adjust our streams
Sorry Buddy
I blame myself
I just realized something We 've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment
Or even a race memory stored in the collective unconscious And I would n't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either
You know Peter this could be a past life experience intruding on the present
Great The marshmallows are about to get their revenge
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT
Look
What What popped in there
I could n't help it It just popped in there
Forget the trapping Just blast him
Agile bastard is n't he
Well that ought to do it
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York and on behalf of the County and State of New York the United States of America the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension
I do n't think it 's Shandor
It does n't seem to have slowed him down any
He 's listed on the blueprints as I Shandor
Who was the architect
No Nobody ever built them like this The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy
I guess they do n't build them like they used to huh
It 's not good Pete
Egon how 's the grid around the storage facility holding up
I ca n't take much more of this The pace is killing me
Boy that was a rough one
I do n't know I 'm just guessing
How do you know
Do n't move It wo n't hurt you
It 's here Ray It 's looking at me
Well hurry up The needle 's going wild
Sit tight I 'm on my way
Third floor Get down here
Where are you Pete
Ray Something 's here
All right Let 's cool the negative vibes These things can sense them
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy
I 'm getting high readings near the air vents It must be using the duct system to get around See I told you we 'd get something
Sure Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back No problem
No sense worrying about it now
So do I
Do you know when that might be We 're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem
They will
It was n't a date It was an investigation
How was your date
Good idea Were any other words spoken that you remember
Why do n't I check out the building It may have a history of psychic turbulence
Fourteen hundred
Do you think it 's wide enough How much
Everybody can relax I found the car How do you like it
This might do I do n't know it just seems kind of pricey for a fixer-upper do n't you think We 're trying to keep our costs down You know how it is when you 're starting a new company
Wow Does this pole still work
Maybe But no one ever advertised before
But most people are afraid to even report these things
But at nineteen percent interest You did n't even bargain with the guy
You 're not going to lose the house Everybody has three mortgages these days
My parents left me that house I was born there
You 'll never regret this Ray
To go into business for ourselves
For what purpose
Let me tell you Ray everything in life happens for a reason Call it fate call it luck Karma whatever I think we were destined to get kicked out of there
Do you know what a patent clerk makes I liked the University They gave us money they gave us the facilities and we did n't have to produce anything I 've worked in the private sector They expect results You 've never been out of college You do n't know what it 's like out there
You 're always so worried about your reputation We do n't need the University Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk 'They ca n't stop progress
This is like a major disgrace Forget M.I.T or Stanford now they would n't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod
Ray I apologize I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced They did this to Galileo too
You said you floored 'em at the Regents meeting
Yeah but I introduced you guys You never would 've met if not for me That 's got to be worth something
If anyone deserves it it 's Spengler and me We 're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment
If you guys are right if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow I think I could win the Nobel Prize
Oh yeah This could be bigger than the microchip They 'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us We 're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady
I guess I got a little overexcited Was n't it incredible I 'm telling you this is a first You know what this could mean to the University
Get her That was your whole plan You call that science
Okay Okay I got it I know what to do Stay close I have a plan
Hey Lady Lady Can you talk Who are you This is not working Think of something else
Anything Just make contact
What do I say
I do n't know Talk to it
What do we do now
I told you it 's real
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly
What is it
Uh-huh I 've heard about the rockfall Ray I think you 've been spending too much time with Spengler
Well I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once
Looked at with your eyes
What do you mean by seen
Ray as your friend I have to tell you I think you 've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff You 've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he 's had an experience And what have you seen
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years The graph we came up with definitely points to something big
No this one 's for real Peter Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings Right off the top of the scale Buried the needle We 're close this time I can feel it
Sure That 's great Ray I think you should get down there right away and check it out Let me know what happens
Peter at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue ten people witnessed a free-roaming vaporous full-torso apparition It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away Scared the socks off some poor librarian
Excuse me for a minute Ray I 'm right in the middle of something here Can you come back in about an hour
What do you mean choose We do n't understand
What 's he talking about Choose what
LATER MAN
Stantz You okay in there
Right We 'll believe anything
You do n't have to worry about that with us sir
Well has it ever occurred to you that the reason you 've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world
Yeah Judgement Day
Judgement Day
Right And the sky would fall
And the seas would boil
Ray do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy
Me too Parts of the Bible are great
No But I liked Jesus style
Do you believe in God
Boy Solid cores of shielded Selenium 325
Me too
Mmmhmmm
Are you a Christian Ray
Uh Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett 's apartment building And they 're most unusual
Hey man What is it you 're so involved with there
Yeah I heard that Now tell me what you really do
Very impressive resume Electronic countermeasures Strategic Air Command Black belt in Karate Small arms expert Mr Zeddemore as you may have heard we locate ghosts and spirits trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people 's homes offices and places of worship
What have I got now It 's exactly as if there were two emperors Because of this the people have two minds He is their champion
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands
Damn him I should have killed him on the front I let you talk me out of that
Do you want posters too
Lykas pick a man Someone who will look good Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action
Send them out
Not yet dear brother
I am their hero
You want control of the crowd you ca n't get it by killing their hero
I want that bastard dead
You ca n't do that listen to the mood of the crowd
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger
by the emperor of Rome This writer asks between a Senate that debates truth until they choke an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without
Yes Go on
encased in the armor of a demigod Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast
But I get what I want always do n't I
If I ever loved Narcissus it was n't like you want
Now that we 're done with that infatuation forever
What are you talking about
Now that is a happy sound Tomorrow I want the citizens my people back in the arena The Gods know I 'm tired Come to bed now tonight we 're celebrating
The fans of Narcissus They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo They believe he 's dying
What is that wailing
Why are you so surly you 've won brother The people have bread and the city is quiet
You must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers
Taking my pleasure Do I need to clear my lovers with you
Where have you been
I have to come back If I do n't come back the people will think I 'm a coward Tribuus tomorrow he dies I want his blood on the sand Do you understand
You 're coming back
Tribuus tomorrow
You ca n't do that You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you
Kill him Tribuus execute that bastard
Why not do it in the Colosseum
For the gods spit it out
If I may be so bold
How about in the forum Right in front of the Senate
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father Except that he ca n't heave out his ghost
It 's disgusting Animals I had to come here under armed guard Slaves get this junk out of my sight
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house If it 's worth something then sell it
Those are priceless sculptures
Let some time pass then ask quietly without anyone knowing it comes from me
No one in Rome has ever heard of him Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with Forget about him
I 'm sure I do n't know
Did Narcissus die today Was n't this his day to die
If you get me pregnant with a boy he 'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne
I should at least have you do n't you think
Maybe you should get married Pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability
They hate me they really hate me do n't they
Why Then they 'll notice when I 'm gone Well I 'm making a public appearance are n't I
Do n't you think you should at least wave
And Caesar Let 's not forget to serve Caesar
Quite so Narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve Rome
Oh stay Do n't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus glory Just remember he is a married man
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed
More wine sister Surely you can drink more than that
I 'm tired of being stuck in that wagon
Will you please get back in your wagon And stay there
That 's what you told me two days ago
We 're nearly there Lucilla
Where are we now Commodus Can you see the camp My Gods The air is turning into ice
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army march on Rome and depose you Then the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again
Endorse me in public Do that and I 'll make you rich and set you free I 'll return your estates I know you would give anything to be outside again Endorse me and you will be free Think of it What would you do with your freedom
On what charge
The army is a problem They love you You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you And after all you 're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty who could fault you for that Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate instead of executing you I 'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate I could have executed you
Where is my family
Apparently my opinion was n't needed
They wo n't break this one
Forgive me Caesar but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people Besides every truce we make with the Germans they break
We have to stop the Germans now
I 'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube
That this illness has clouded his mind
Caesar
Being as close I 'm certain you 've noticed what we all have noticed
You flatter me Caesar
You and my father have become very close Perhaps one day I may say the same for us
Do we really need to repair this fort It seems like an expensive undertaking I propose we burn it to the ground That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position
But they 're not destroyed not yet
The dangerous man Caesar is the man who does n't care
I would say there 's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right is
Oh but with the army behind you you could become extremely political Not a Republican by any chance
I back Rome against all her enemies if that answer disappoints you I 'm not a politician
Or perhaps into a new one But here 's to your God and the courage of our legions
Gladly Caesar
Then you 'd be out of a job
Perhaps Master Galen you may say
That 's difficult to say general
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience
Of course but not now However if he continues to be unwell you may report to me
Respectfully Caesar Quintus and I must report
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas My father sends his heart felt praise Sadly Marcus is in dark humors nothing to worry about but he needs rest Likely just the weather
I would n't know who to bet on
Caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena
Make a gift to the people It 's your money anyway so it 's only fair
Take grain away from the army
Sacks of grain even bread I own the grain licenses for the military I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube
Give away food
We can crush Gaius another way What if you do throw something to the people they really want Make them a gift of food
So am I
I 'm serious
Maybe it 'll crush Gaius
Yes You know that 's not a bad idea
Throw it down into the streets Down into the Forum If it 's my father they want then give him to them
At the opening of the month of Janus I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship
And like children everywhere they scream freedom the most when they desire it least I beg you please continue Caesar
Until your confirmation date
Gods of hell This must cost a fortune How many days is this going to go on
At least stay for the running of the animals You are paying for it you know
Ignore that The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
Caesar ignore them
How can they Who else is there I have no heir
The Senate is out to sink you I swear it Caesar your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory They will hear that you are living in luxury He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life And soon the army wo n't even remember your name
Insubordination To the Emperor and the Senate
You do n't want to kill him If anything happens to him now you will be blamed and he knows it Besides that gladiator school is a fortress It would take the army to break in there What you want is to offer him the wooden sword If he takes it he 's no longer the champion of the people is he He 's gone And you are a hero for awarding it
Underdog How can he be an underdog he wins all the time I 'm the emperor why ca n't I kill him He could be poisoned or somehow killed to look like an accident
It 's because he comes off as the underdog
Narcissus will never support you Caesar he has too much of a philosophical temperament
This is the only place in Rome where I thought I believed I was wholly in power
I met with Falco and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans
We must obey our emperor and the Senate
He left us at dawn
Marcus Aurelius has died
I 'm certain father will be in better humors by then Now honor us with your presence at dinner I 'll join you as soon as I see my father 's physician
Gladly Caesar And if you 'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light
We need more statues perhaps I should open medical clinics For the poor Citizens only though
Yes Caesar
Tribuus Go left here I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia
Jerses tomorrow
Yes Caesar
Caesar I did my best The Colosseum is n't under my control
Why is n't he dead Damn you you promised me he would be dead
He must have been He was on the list of prisoners to be executed
Tribuus what happened in the arena Was Narcissus killed
Where is the emperor and the army soldier
Where is my father
You know there were riots last night Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division You understand what you are doing
I 'll nose around
AGH Please He 's having a secret device constructed for the circus The brass craftsmen are working overtime
I do n't know
Cos what in hades is the emperor up to And do n't tell me you do n't know
Commodus he 's a gladiator is he mad
Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod Hercules has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens The Emperor 's going to fight in the arena I 'm supposed to write this for tomorrow 's edition
I 'm mentioning you in tomorrow 's athlete 's section legate So I 'd love to know your birth sign it effects how people bet And perhaps you could tell me a bit about well who are you
This is Cos this precocious young man A scribe for the Daily Action I 've invited him to write a small piece about you
You won an impossible fight You got the attention of the crowd legate
Yes because I know they 'll read it
It 's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border It 's time to tell the citizens everything Will you write it
Proximo we need to talk about my one third I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business And what was the name of that olive oil company
That makes his birth sign Virgo Why that 's the sign of a little girl Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates He was born on August thirty-first you know
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed
My birth sign is Water Bearer twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus
I am prepared to write anything you tell me
That 's their job is n't it To argue So I think my case will be long on talk and short on action
So tell me what happened between you and the emperor What really happened on the German front You know the Senate 's arguing your case
My only visits to Rome Senator have been through books But the war 's over time to close the door of war once and for all
But have never been
I 've read of it
You know general there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace Sadly it has remained open for three hundred years
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory Thanks to Marcus Aurelius
God of passages and changes
The battle was won today and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus the eldest God of Rome God of my ancestors
I hope you live to see what I believe
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear If you are a friend to neither side legate you must be an enemy to both We needed to know what you believed
The Senate too
We all know what right is Senator
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right is
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes At the core he 's a man who believes in doing what 's right
Yes The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over thanks to your father Now report to the Senate Master Galen what is Marcus state
I would venture with all respect the Emperor 's health is the business of every soul in the empire
You do n't know how wrong you are
You 're a citizen and a soldier Not a gladiator
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial You 'd have to give me your word
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
You 're hearing about somebody else
Who are you Narcissus The Good I have heard of Narcissus Meridas That 's who I hear you are
They ca n't if this is Rome
Is this Rome Are we just going to be executed
That 's what worries me
Fools to let us both live we 'll be our own best witnesses at our trial
My loyalties were in doubt
Why you
You on your way to trial too general Or do you think they 've already had our trial
Hidden Where my brother can not place hands on them He did n't have the guts to watch them die so I took care of it all The sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe
Where are they
Narcissus I have your family They 're alive All of them
He killed his father and then my family
Marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
Would that Marcus had lived
You can not die
But what if I wish to be purple
If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads But
Do you remember your Epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman Read to sleep on Catullus Lucretius Virgil every night My beautiful daughters
For the sake of the Gods you 're not leading these men How like my father you are You 'believe I guess that 's why you 're still alive
Twenty years I 've led men to die For me it was the glory of Rome But that was something If it was n't that then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore but that was something These men here are butchered for laughs Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line
But you do exist Narcissus hero of the battle of the Danube
You mean a symbol of someone who does n't exist
I came here to see that you stay alive The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus a hero
Yours will do
It 's my brother 's neck you want not mine
Of course I know who do you think is paying for it The Emperor himself did n't you know Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front Burning patriotism Filial love He wants to be sure when he takes over there 's enough cash left in the treasury to play Emperor Watch out for him Narcissus he 's inexperienced but be careful
I do n't believe that He 's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron You know we 're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany
How do you know I am playing Well the clown is always harmless Is n't that right And how did you ever get to know me so well The last we spent any time together I was fourteen I think you know me better than my father He 's going to die is n't he
Why do you play at being drunk
Why do you keep playing at being so humble It 's a little embarrassing
I 'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I 'm not taking the job
Without him He 'd be weeping if he overheard that Well The idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting
Sneaking around with your brother
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities
Only from a distance
You know our two most senior Senators Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus
Narcissus Terrified You The only thing he 's scared of is me
No future-telling please I 've been terrified enough for one day
I 'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I ca n't be that power
AURELIUS They fear change The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible You could be the one the Emperor the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic
They fear me
AURELIUS The Senators admire you
Marcus you honor me but I 'm a soldier politics scare the hell out of me
AURELIUS A man should be upright not be kept upright History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute I want you to consider becoming my heir
You 're too hard on him He is a strong young man with you as his guide
AURELIUS Everyone talking about it I would n't wonder All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate Thus I have transferred legal power which was theirs to begin with back to the Senators This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan It 's a start only a start If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share This means Commodus has to bend does he strike you as that type
So I understand
AURELIUS It 's not because he 's young it 's because he 's ignorant and arrogant His sister is a better man That 's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate
Commodus is just a young man he 'll learn what you had to learn
AURELIUS If I 'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have no again it 's my own bullheadedness Narcissus I should have adopted you years ago And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son
He 's like you sir too tough for the Gods to swallow
AURELIUS Servis made it through again
There 's no reason to say that Everyone knows you 're going to be well I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light
AURELIUS I 've made so many mistakes Narcissus We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we 're afraid of admitting when our lives are over
I will Marcus But you 're going to be well enough to direct it yourself
AURELIUS I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign
AURELIUS Commodus listen to Narcissus listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome You 're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they 're most vulnerable
AURELIUS Commodus it 's we who are going on the offensive
On my honor as your daddy
On your honor as a Roman officer daddy
As soon as I can
Tomorrow
Do n't stop to visit take the children straight home and I 'll follow as soon as I can
Much more colorful than the ones we wear And of course less dented
I made the plume from a quail feather
Can you stop that slaughter Can you free these men
What are you fighting for in here The good of Rome I can end this madness now Take the job for the sake of the Gods live
The 'people listen to the people they know what they want A government that gives them what they need and does n't bother them with messy thoughts of issues You know messy thinking They want a dictator As far as the children there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of being you A famous gladiator
Then give the empire back to the people the children who will grow up to become senators
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand Narcissus the Republic is dead You think those Senators could govern For the last hundred and fifty years they 've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses
Quintus you 've got at least a division with you we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate
It 's my job to keep my job And that by the way is now head of Praetorian Guard Good ole Tribuus has been retired
It 's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons
I was summoned
You brought the army into Rome
I ca n't let you do that
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here The Senate may be vacillating but I have the army behind me I 'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort
Well they die for it
My troops do n't make policy
Rome is going to pay tribute like a defeated nation begging for mercy Have you told your troops that
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis
What deal
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive They 've got nothing to lose and it 's so very like them
Serious stuff
Well we can try
Why do n't we try to keep politics out of the conversation
What the hell do you think it was about There 's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others
What the hell was all that about
Let 's hope he does n't start giving orders
I see the emperor 's little boy has finally caught up with the army
That 's what I 'm going to do That 's what I 'm going to do
You teach them
They 'll have me Teach them Do n't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history without philosophy without meaning Teach them of the Greeks the Babylonians the Hebrews the Numidians the Egyptians and the great Romans Teach them who we are
Your daughters need more than some vapors they need you
I 'll never die You tell the girls that You honor our ancestors and I 'll be there Every night At the table of life
I do n't want you to die
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered If I die fighting Commodus he wo n't care about you If I live I 'll come and get you
Narcissus
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he 's in power A month Half a year Paestum will be a prison where he 'll hold us until it 's time
You 're not going You have to stay with us
No
When you get to Ostia use this bribe passage to Africa or Spain Save my family You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia
What you do n't want to imagine is the things I 've done
I do n't even want to imagine the things you 've seen
Me Well I believe in Rome you 'd have to after what I 've seen how people outside the empire treat each other
I never knew a more idealistic man than you
Quintus is overly idealistic
Let him trust Quintus
I want to come home of course I do I 'd have to be mad not to want that It 's just that Marcus trusts me
We do n't need your help we 're doing great on our own
I 'm a soldier we 're at war I ca n't stay home tending the damned olive groves
Who else I 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome Or for the glory of you
Very fancy Did you design the bottle
I 've been overseeing production myself for the past three years you 'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become
This is our oil from our estates
If you win you know you have to stay It 's the losers who get to go home Besides I 'm not so sure it is over Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines
The battle is over The war is over You 've won
I can see that
You need to come home
Of course
They 're studying with Cynics
What about their philosophy lessons
Athenians
Greeks
Well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers
Is n't the helmet magnificent
He 's very realistic
Are you mad With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night Anyway I 'm not political I 'm in the entertainment business
Commodus must hate you Free your gladiators and come with us
Something else then Do the chariot races interest you
I want nothing to do with the arena
Let 's talk about this later Right now we have other things to settle You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia From there Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum It 's beautiful an old Greek town right on the ocean Rich soil Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it 's always good to look to the future keep your hand in the arena so to speak
Was I
You were a soldier and then a gladiator were n't you
So things change The government has moved to the circus You 're going to fight last And Commodus is going to fight first
I 'll do it Sure as there 's shit in the Tiber we 're all going to die but for you anything
I want another interview with Cos Tell him to bring plenty of ink
Right right what am I thinking of
Before they leave get gold
Right right But they 'll have to bring in a lawyer I do n't want to get sued over this
Then get a large cash advance
Fantastic Wonderful But posters are very expensive
No Tell them I 'll do it But I want more posters all over Rome
I can really rape them on this Can I at least tell them you 'll think about it
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right They do n't waste time
A great deal They designed and build Tiger 's chariot
How much money is involved
Oh shit Take your time Do n't get suckered This man is a murderer In his career he 's killed over a thousand gladiators Please just take the fall
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth Take my advice and make that bet
On you Of course You are my bravest fighter the best fighter I have ever seen
Tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting if this were a fair fight where would you put your money
It 's absolutely not like that This is for your own good Come on get the rest of your armor on
Pressures on eh Proximo There 's got to be a load of money in this Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window
But you have to go out there I 'll give you more than your one third When I get paid just take the fall You 're too hurt to fight and the man 's a killer
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins I do n't know Proximo who has better wine than you Besides I 'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life
As what 'The Galloping Gladiator
You get to come alive again in the country
So I pretend I 'm dead You get gold what do I get
You put this inside your shirt when Tiger stabs your stomach it 's full of pig 's blood Gushes out everywhere It 's really impressive Fantastic Better than the real thing
What the hell are you talking about Greek
Tiger 's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer you take a fall
Make us rich Proximo make us very rich
No more bad luck now The people are anticipating you I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior the true Roman The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome
Lucky it did n't step on his head
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna he was crushed by an elephant
Do n't be ridiculous
Proximo if this is her doctor he 's an assassin
Alive I 'm alive
General hang on drink slowly You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight A fan sent them to you
Think about it Just think about it
What would the poster say Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company Small but profitable They asked if you would endorse their oil We could get some very nice posters Make some very big money
That 's one way to look at it
I did n't get killed and everyone else did
General do you realize what happened out there today
Then you 'll die Just know this because you asked I asked I 'm sorry but
I 'm not a gladiator I refuse to fight
Legate Narcissus Meridas general of the Spanish Felix Legions I 'm proud to have you in my school Now show them what you can do
to fight We 'll see
I refuse to be your slave I refuse
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I wo n't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here I know what you 're trying to do kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you 're a very important individual You make me feel good about my investment And that puking pig Jerses he wo n't even discuss you Both of you have clamped mouths But I love all my fighters I 'll find out about your family And about you That I promise
Chain him
Take your hands off me animal
Death is everything for me Now you have to go to your cell and I to dicker with Jerses you 'll be fed well I want you to be fit as you can be I want you to win for me tomorrow I want all my gladiators to win and be happy Besides I 've never owned a Roman general before
Death is a very light thing for you
You are to be killed exactly They 'll give you a sporting chance but just enough to make your murder entertaining Romans like to mix their metaphors laughter with their executions you know If you survive though you will become a gladiator A gladiator at least gets a fair fight
Thank you What is going to happen tomorrow Exactly
Impossible Every citizen has a right to trial this is Rome
General all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
Condemned Are n't I owed a trial before being condemned
I am the man who might save your life give you a bit more life at any rate I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me I own this school and everything that 's in it You 're in it But why What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum Understand we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets Please I separated you from the others because my nose tells me you 've been condemned for important reasons
Who the hell are you
I 'm a Greek thank you And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white Relax tell me everything I 'm your friend
I killed too many barbarians
You 're a legate in the Roman army Huh and you act like one What was your crime
What
Benjamin
Maybe we are and maybe we are n't

Oh no Look I like you I would n't keep coming here if I did n't like you
ROBINSON That 's all right I think I can understand why I 'm disgusting to you
But it 's not
ROBINSON If that 's how you feel
Well look I was kind of upset there I 'm sorry I said those things
ROBINSON Well it 's pretty obvious you do n't want me around any more
What are you doing
ROBINSON Of course I would n't
You would n't
ROBINSON I did n't mean it I do n't think you 'd be right for each other But I would never say you were n't as good a person as she is
Well two minutes ago you told me I was n't good enough for your daughter Now you say you 're sorry I got that impression
ROBINSON Benjamin I want to apologize to you if that 's the impression you got
Of course you did
ROBINSON Did I say that
Mrs Robinson you stand there and tell me I 'm not good enough for your daughter
ROBINSON Do n't you expect me to be a little hurt
Do n't start acting hurt
ROBINSON What
Now do n't start this

You 're goddamn right I am
ROBINSON Are you
Because Mrs Robinson this is the sickest most perverted thing that ever happened to me And you do what you want but I 'm getting the hell out
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom then you 're all wrong
ROBINSON I see

ROBINSON I would n't know
You go to hell You go straight to hell Mrs Robinson Do you think I 'm proud of myself Do you think I 'm proud of this
ROBINSON Yes

ROBINSON Benjamin
We 're not dropping it Now that 's the reason is n't it I 'm a dirty degenerate are n't I I 'm not fit to
ROBINSON Let 's drop it

Let 's hear your reasons Mrs Robinson Because I think I know what they are
ROBINSON No
Then let 's hear them

ROBINSON Do you understand that
ROBINSON Benjamin do n't you ever take that girl out
Well I guess I 'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what 's

ROBINSON See if you can guess
Why did you do that
Well wait a minute You married him
ROBINSON I never did Benjamin Now let 's

ROBINSON Is it
Well that 's kind of a bad situation then is n't it
ROBINSON I do n't
Well how do you feel about him then
ROBINSON No Benjamin I do n't hate him Unhook my blouse
But you do n't hate him

BRADDOCK When did you two talk this over
About an hour ago
BRADDOCK Well when did you decide all this
No they do n't
BRADDOCK They do n't know
BRADDOCK Oh Ben this is so exciting
I 'm going up to Berkeley today
BRADDOCK then I 'll simply invite all the Robinsons over for dinner on Thursday
I do
BRADDOCK Do n't go on like this Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out
Next time he suggests it I 'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life
BRADDOCK It 's pretty embarrassing I really do n't know what to tell Mr Robinson It 's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine
BRADDOCK Goodnight
But I want you to Please Please will you believe me
You do n't
BRADDOCK No
You believe me do n't you
BRADDOCK Goodnight Benjamin
I 'm not But I 'm I 'm not very proud of what I do I usually get kind of drunk I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk Then I take a hotel room So I wo n't have to drive home on the freeway I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after
BRADDOCK But I do n't want you to make up something
I do
BRADDOCK Not if you do n't want to
Oh Well I do n't Shall I tell you what I do
BRADDOCK Because I know you do n't drive around for twelve hours
Well why do you why do you think that
Well wait
BRADDOCK Benjamin I 'm not going to pry into your affairs but I 'd rather you did n't say anything at all than be dishonest Goodnight Benjamin
I do n't meet anyone mother but why did you say that
No wait Wait
BRADDOCK Well this is your business Benjamin If you
Why did you say that
Meet someone
BRADDOCK Then what do you do Do you meet someone
Oh no
BRADDOCK Well you do n't drive around from midnight until noon the next day Benjamin
Nothing else
BRADDOCK What else
I drive around
No I do I want to tell you
BRADDOCK You do n't have to tell me if you do n't want
When I go off
BRADDOCK Well I 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night
What
BRADDOCK Benjamin I 'm going to ask you something but you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want
Sure
BRADDOCK Can I talk to you a minute
Hello Mrs Robinson
BRADDOCK Say hello to Mrs Robinson Benjamin
No it 's not It 's completely baked It 's a decision I 've made
BRADDOCK Ben this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked
No Actually she does n't know about us getting married yet
BRADDOCK She does n't know that you 're coming up to Berkeley
No She does n't know about it
BRADDOCK Wait a minute You talked to Elaine this morning
No I think you 'll want to wait on that
BRADDOCK Come on let 's call the Robinsons We 've got something to celebrate
I 'm going to marry Elaine Robinson
BRADDOCK Say that again
BRADDOCK I guess I 'll just tell Mr Robinson that you 're just too busy every evening doing God knows what
That has nothing to do with it
BRADDOCK How do you know You have n't seen her since high school I guess your evenings whatever you do with them are just too valuable
Look Elaine Robinson and I do not get along
BRADDOCK I guess she 's not good enough for you is that it
BRADDOCK Now listen Ben I think it 's a very good thing that a young man after he 's done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass
You got me
BRADDOCK Would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for What was the point of all that hard work
No
BRADDOCK Have you thought about graduate school
Well it 's very comfortable just to drift here
BRADDOCK Why
Different
BRADDOCK To be what
I do n't know I want it to be
BRADDOCK What about it
I guess about my future
BRADDOCK About what
Well
BRADDOCK worried
I 'm just
ROBINSON I think I 've talked about this enough I do n't know how far I can go Ben I do n't know if I can prosecute or not but I think maybe I can In the light of what 's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure
HUH
ROBINSON Well I 'm sure you think you do Ben but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you 'd get over that as quickly as you
The point is I do n't love your wife I love your daughter sir
ROBINSON Do n't shout at me Ben
You miss the point
ROBINSON Shaking hands Well that 's not saying much for my wife is it
Listen to me We got we got into bed with each other But it was nothing It was nothing at all We might we might just as well have been shaking hands
ROBINSON That 's quite a statement
It should n't make any difference what happened
ROBINSON Why
But why
ROBINSON Well I do n't think we have a whole lot to say to each other Ben I do think you should know the consequences of what you 've done I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon
No I do n't
ROBINSON You do n't respect me terribly much either do you
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you Mr Robinson I am trying to tell you I do not resent you
ROBINSON Do you want to unclench your fists please Thank you I can see in the dark you know I 've been here quite a while
I am not threatening you
ROBINSON Ben I think we 're two civilized human beings Do you think it 's necessary to threaten each other
Now look please
ROBINSON Well Ben it was quite a bit to do with me
It was nothing to do with you sir
ROBINSON Is there something I 've said that 's caused this contempt Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise
No it 's not
ROBINSON Do you have a special grudge against me Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me
Mr Robinson
ROBINSON Do you want do you want to try and tell me why you did it
Yes
ROBINSON What would you say to a short one Bourbon still your drink
Hello
ROBINSON Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together
I will
ROBINSON That 's what I 'd do if I could Nothing wrong with that Hey Ben Elaine 's coming down from Berkeley soon I want you to call her up this time
Oh not too much Taking it easy
ROBINSON Hi Ben What are you doing with yourself these days

Oh no
ROBINSON You have yourself a few flings this summer I bet you 're quite a ladies man
ROBINSON Ben I think I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to

ROBINSON So I hope you wo n't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice

You do believe that I really love you

Grusinskaya
Yes yes yes
Do you understand
I could n't go through with it Remarkable
And now
I wanted money desperately Can you understand That 's why I wanted the pearls I was threatened I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money I 've been following you I 've admired you But I have forced myself not to think about you Last night at last I managed to came into your room and and now
But now you must go I give you the pearls But now you must go
Yesterday I was a thief but now
So
I know
I 'll not denounce you
I do n't want them now
You may keep the pearls I do n't want them any more I 'll make you a present of them
Oh
There
What is the matter
Please look at me You must believe me you must believe that I love you that I have never known what love is until last night
That 's a silly joke
I 'm also a criminal and a hotel thief
Oh What a picture and what else
I 'm a gambler I 'm running at large like a happy pig devouring anything of life that pleases me I really belong in jail
And what do you do now
And then in the war to kill and hide That 's all
And
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman at school it was a monastery I learned to pray and lie and
No
Really I have n't a bit of character None at all
Really
I 'm a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock I shall die on the gallows
Flix And how do you live What kind of a person are you
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern My mother called me Flix
Oh I was ambitious then ambition was in my blood no rest no stopping We were drilled like little soldiers We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet in St Petersburg I was little and slim but hard as diamond a duty machine No rest no stopping And then I became famous and whoever is famous is alone But why should I be telling you this Last night I did not know you at all who are you really I do not even know your name
That is not the truth You do not want to be alone you 're afraid of being alone I know you 're afraid I know you You were desperate just now if I go away you 'll be more desperate than ever Say I am to stay with you say it
I want to be alone
The veronal you I 'm going to stay here with you
What
I 'm not going You know that I 'm not going Do you think I could leave you alone here After that
Beautiful but so sad I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman 's bedroom
No
You are beautiful
What can you see
Because I can see something in the mirror that you can not My dear
Why do you smile
I should like to smoke
I see you do only what you take pleasure in doing You take pleasure in coming into a woman 's bedroom and you come You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony so you do it And what is your pleasure now
I Oh no I do only what I take pleasure in doing
The stage frays one 's nerves the discipline it 's so exacting Discipline means doing what you do n't want to do and take no pleasure in doing Do you know what I mean Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline
Just for a minute then
No You do n't want to be alone at all You were in despair before If I left you you 'd feel worse than you did before You must not be alone You must n't cry you must forget Tell me that I can stay with you tell me
I want to be alone
That is not so you do n't want to be alone
I want to be alone
I 'm not going You know I 'm not going Let me stay here
I think you must go now the key is on the floor
Yes I do understand
Grusinskaya Oh oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya for the success of Grusinskaya for the triumph of Grusinskaya and what is she now Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases Are you listening to me Do you understand I want you to understand
I saw you just now then I saw you cry and now I see you in the mirror Grusinskaya
You could love me It is so long since I have heard that word Nobody has loved me for a long time It is so icy-cold to be famous One is so cruelly alone How is it that you Let me look at you Your hands Your eyes Why could you love me
A man who could love that is all who has forgotten everything else for you
Go away Who are you
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman 's room when she 's alone
He disappeared Later he was found dead
And
Not quite strange now It is as if I had been expecting you You know once when the Grand Duke was alive I found a man hiding in my room a young officer
Am I quite strange to you
Strange man
You must n't talk Russian to me
Alone All alone Oh you strange strange creature
So alone
Yes tired
How tired you are
And and
No irony You 're so appealing so soft so tired I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever
And then
I did not know you were so beautiful and
Why do you look at me like that
Certainly
I 'd like to smoke a cigarette
So you feel like coming into a lady 's room and you come What now
I 'm afraid not I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment
Nerves just nerves You must forgive me I have had a bad evening I am very tired Do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence
Do n't cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that
I was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that No I am not afraid It is strange
Poor little Grusinskaya Does it do you good to cry Are you afraid Shall I go
Because you love me you love me
But surely you must know because I love you
Why do you hide in my room
Nothing only to be here
What do you want here
Please do not be frightened Madam
Oh no stay here Baron stay
You 're all right now it 's very late goodnight Kringelein

Was the Baron joking or is it really true that the Baron is in financial straits

Do I know him I know him through and through
Then you know him

The war dropped him here and forgot him
Yes He always seems to be waiting for something and nothing ever comes
That is Doctor Otternschlag You know him
The war
No doubt you would Baron But do you know I 'm quite indispensable to her I 'm her ballet master and her nurse I hardly belong to myself anymore But there you are it 's Grusinskaya you ca n't help adoring her
My dear sir I would gladly change rooms with you
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby
It 's always so quiet here
Yes but the audience
I thought she was splendid
Well last night was not so good
Certainly always when Grusinskaya dances
Grusinskaya well to tell the truth Baron tonight we are a little bit nervous Were you at the theatre last night

Insolent Berlin manners
Pardon me the lady has urgent business here with me
Most imposters are
I do n't believe it he was a real gentleman I know people I 'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel that means a lot of work But it 's too bad about the Baron you always felt better when he came along always friendly such an agreeable fellow
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter

Try and sleep Kringelein do n't be afraid
Over over so soon it has just begun Oh the pain

You do n't understand that do you
Yes of course money
Money
Then why did you have anything to do with him
I did n't like Preysing right off
He was in desperate straits He 'd been trying to raise money all day He laughed Poor devil And then a man like Preysing kills him
Perhaps he really was a burglar But they do n't kill a man for that
So did I He was friendly to me as no man ever was
Yes

Moreover
Moreover
You 're a very unusual stenographer

No only occasional jobs
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz office
Moreover

Moreover
Then you will please wait outside

What
Yes Mr Preysing that 's what we want to know
What we want to know about is Manchester
Very simple I 've always liked the way you dressed Preysing English is n't it
Oh ho you want legal aid against us The whole thing seems to me to be very simple
Shhh here he is now
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company but if they have n't they 're ruined Preysing will have to declare himself
Exactly
And ask me what it 's costing us to hammer it down
Next week
See you soon Preysing Next week we 'll meet and discuss further details
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign
Under these circumstances it 's quite a different matter
I thought we 'd suspended negotiations gentlemen
Preysing you 're joking with us
Gentlemen I am now free to announce that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated
If you actually have news from Manchester then
Oh no no the session is over Let 's go it 's off Thank you gentlemen
What
Why talk it 's over it 's over it 's finished You 've broken off negotiations You did it You 're calling them off You had nothing on your mind all day but Manchester Manchester Manchester You do n't suppose for one moment that I 'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester
Goodbye Preysing I hope you pull through This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis We 've
Yes
Then it 's all over
Yes
You 've decided against the merger
Sorry Preysing
What
Mop rags mop rags we 're interested in something quite different
Evil days I 've shown you here my company exports to the Balkans alone sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year
And I said we did n't
I know you did I said you did
Of course you took the initiative
Scratched We did not take the initiative
Tentative my foot a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door
We did not approach you
Oh now let 's talk like adults You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it would n't sound so good When you first approached us
Now to proceed with the projected merger the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious
All you have to do is phone for it
No water What a place
Oh Preysing Preysing
I 'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz before I commit myself
Mop rags
I 'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern Active capital plant and machinery raw material and finished product for instance mop rags
Oh yes I beg your pardon
Since on the eleventh of June this year when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages
All right
We are here to discuss our merger Naturally I can make no statement at this time We must begin at the beginning
I mean with the Manchester people
We have a good many connections in England naturally
There 's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company They 've the whole English market right in their hands Have you any connections with Manchester
Manchester yes Yes yes they do Yes Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning Have we cigars water and everything
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester
What
What a session this has been
Here 's my signature here Preysing sign here
You 've talked enough today you 're hoarse now
Mr Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties
I 've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger What reason have we now The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days very evil days
and let me say again for the tenth time you people were quite ready for the merger You declared yourselves fully agreed on all the terms Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up
We did not approach you
As you remember it when you approached us
Thank God we 're beginning at the beginning
Since on the eleventh of June of this year when the first negotiations for a merger
Foggy frightfully foggy always I 'm told Have you said anything about Manchester Mr Preysing
How clear is Manchester
In that case give us the articles We 'll sign at once We know all the details
You 're a deep one
Ah come on we 're going home
You see what we are interested in
Why waste time it 's getting late
Shall I tell them again
He likes to play the great man
Nine-thirty Mr Preysing keeps us waiting
Where is Pimenov Where is Pimenov

What is this that you have cancelled your car Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door And here on a whim you cancel your car Have you forgotten there is a performance Do you know the time Or are we all mad Am I your manager Have we a contract Have we obligations Am I blind Or is that the time
But when did he go How do you know
He will be on the train
Yes Pimenov One minute Suzette I will call you
Gru you are positively radiant
Good morning Gru your
Good morning Pimenov
That theatre half empty dancing for those few I was frantic I finished the last beat and I waited I listened but the applause did n't come nothing A man in the box and just the claques behind it is passed Pimenov We are dead it 's finished
There was there was
Last night There was no applause
What what is it Last night
It is not stage fright it 's something more
The performance the performance the performance
It is time for the performance
Please

Yes the merger must go through But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis I am not a liar I am an honest business man a good husband and father I have a sense of honor I have nothing to conceal I could n't live happily otherwise
Good heavens no That 'd create the very worst impression You must be optimistic You must convince them You know as well as I do that the merger must go through
No news from Manchester yet Do you think we ought to postpone the conference
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter

Evening Welcome to Phoenix
Hah
Come on kid let 's see if there 's any food in the house
I like you too
The kids beat him up because his home life is uh different
Roy He 's always crying
Your kid 's in the back here He 's crying
Oh Cole please Please come out of it What would I do without you
Demon Demon That 's why you can walk on it Demon
It 's all hollow Nothing behind it
It 's just the strain again the stress We 'll take a vacation
Ca n't move
Cole it 'll be all right Honey
Henry no
You ruined me You destroyed me
We 're not really interested Henry
Come take a look An entire-suite of main-frame computer
Oh Henry no that 's just boring
Want a look
Mister Hebbing we are talking about breaking the law here I want to be sure you understand that No one gets hurt but the law does get broken
So here we are
Well If Mary Beth vouches for you and if she told you the story already
Oh I know I know and you 've been wonderful since I was widowed But Mister Hebbing has you do n't mind my telling him darling suffered reverses If he could
Mary Beth This has never been anything but
Henry next time could n't Mister Hebbing
Goody
Well I 'll have to take your word for it Mary Beth Here 's your money
Well of course not I know how dangerous this is But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything Would n't I darling
Mary Beth I hope you are n't spreading this good news too widely
Oh I told Mister Hebbing all about it how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients
Mary Beth what we have here uh
You brought a case Good
I must admit Mister Fellowes I had moments I was worried
Here you are Two rich people
These machines They 're in here
Seven seconds I do n't see how you do it
We have to be ready We have to have the money and we have to know what the information means and we have to move immediately
Not much time
Every once in a while a major change comes through We have seven seconds to take advantage put our buy order our sell order into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in
Well you 've got your information ahead of New York I see that
You 're right And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange He can give us when it 's really useful a seven second delay in that movement of information Do you know what that means
One of those computer geniuses is n't it
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us New York one hour behind There is n't one hour of the day when both are open Information moves but it has to wait Now we have a young fellow working here Do you know what a hacker is Mister Hebbing
I can keep my mouth shut Mister Fellowes
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about
I certainly hope not
And I do n't just mean the SEC We could have the FBI breathing down our necks
Well that 's what the law 's for is n't it
My son will be all right If he is n't I 'll have you killed
Yes yes but that 's
You know who I work for
His blood pressure is under a hundred I do n't think he 'll live to get to the hospital
Well make it stop
Mrs Dillon your son was in some sort of accident He 's had an internal hemorrhage he 's bleeding to death inside
What He 's going to be all right
The ambulance is on the way for what good it will do
Maybe I 'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way
Take two three days Call when you get there
I know
Nine hundred Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time Come on Lilly you do n't argue with Bobo
Delmar I never go out to California That 's a thousand miles from here
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar
You are seeing it You 're looking right at it
Well I 'd have to see it of course
I have only one thing now Are you interested
You 'll give us an opportunity to serve you again I hope If there 's anything you think we might be interested in
It 's not your fault
I hope you 're not too badly disappointed with us Mrs Langtry
I 'll get you a check
All right
Why of course it is I can offer you well five hundred dollars
It was a gift It is n't worth anything at all
Glass will cut glass Mrs Langtry Do you know where it was purchased
But they must be They cut glass
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I 've ever seen But the stones no They 're not diamonds Mrs Langtry
What is
I ca n't understand a thing like this It 's something you almost never see
But what 's wrong
You are a valued customer as you know
Why What 's wrong
Mrs Langtry I 'm sorry
Fair enough
That 's what we 'll do then But I tell you what Roy Before I hire anybody else I 'll ask you one last time Fair enough
Oh I 'd like to stay on Just keep everything the way it was
Well Roy if that 's the way you feel I wo n't badger you Do n't want to lose you as a salesman too
Maybe I 'm just not ready for that yet
A well-rounded life I respect that But it has to have a center Roy something you care about something you can think about
Okay fine Perk the truth is I like things the way they are now Pick my own hours have time for uh other activities
Perk remember
The truth is Mr Kaggs
Oh come on Roy
I guess I 'm just not a leader of men
You 're turning me down Makes no sense Roy
Mr Kaggs I 'm sorry
Good to have you back Roy I was just looking at
Perk
And I 'm Perk Short for Percy I 'm afraid
Oh sure Fine
See you in a week Roy I can call you Roy
Well
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department Things 've gone to hell this long they can go a little longer
But you need a man right now It would n't be fair to you to
I did n't realize Yeah you do look a little pale How soon will you be ready A week
I ca n't take that job I mean I mean I ca n't take it right away I 'm still recuperating I just dropped in to say hello see everybody
No
Well uh No
That 's just the first year If you are n't worth a lot more than that the second year I 'll kick you out What do you say
What Me
I do n't know offhand what your best year 's been we can look it up The idea is we 'll top it by fifteen percent
Sounds like a good Idea
That 's right you 've had to supervise yourself This place needs a sales manager Somebody who 's proved he 's a salesman and can handle other salesmen He 'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out new men to hire What do you think
Just myself
Makes no difference to me if they 're only on commission If they do n't make good money they 're not giving us good representation and we ca n't afford to have them around Ever supervise salesmen
So I heard
When I said you being the best salesman here did n't say much I meant for us I know your record with Sarber and Webb and I 'd say you 're a top-flight man but you 've had no incentive No one walking on your heels Just a lot of half asses so the tendency 's been not to stretch yourself I 'm bouncing the slobs incidentally
Lead on
You 're right I apologize But I still want to talk to you
That was a pretty backhanded compliment If I let people get away with things like that I would n't be a good salesman
What 's up
I know that Knew it when I saw you out there The best salesman here which is n't saying much Want to talk to you Dillon
Roy Dillon
Kaggs Home office
Hello
Whadaya say
NO
Is there nothing I can do Roy nothing at
Lilly Jesus what are you doing
I have to have that money Roy What do I have to do to get it
There 's nothing more to talk about
What
Roy What if I told you I was n't really your mother That we were n't related
Just trying to help Lilly
That 's what it is is n't it Keep me down Your turn to be in charge have the power
That money would n't last forever And then what You 'd be back in some other part of the rackets Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands This way you 've got to go the square route You could send me a card when you 're settled I could maybe help out sometimes
A future The only future I 've got
If I should get out of the racket that goes double for you That 's why you 've got to change your life completely go to some town get a square job live like a john yourself If you try to do it your way what future is in it
Oh that 's it You 're stealing my money for my own good How very motherly of you Lilly
And that 's why you 've got to get rid of this money If you keep it around it 'll just make you think how clever you are It 'll be a temptation to get back into the game
Well it does n't matter does it I 'm getting out
Sure sure that does n't count That 's different
Well uh
Well I guess I got it wrong then Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him
I do n't see why not
If you stayed a crook do you think you 'd live to be my ripe age
I do n't
That 's good You do n't really belong on this side of the fence you know
That 's right
You 're getting off the grift
No
I gave you your life twice I 'm asking you to give me mine once I need the money
For God 's sake Lilly
And making you feel bad at the same time huh But that 's the way I am you know the way I 've always been Always picking on poor little Roy
What do you want me to do Pin a halo on you You 're doing a pretty good job of that yourself
No I guess not It was pretty lousy of me I guess to be a child at the same time you were Not to stop being a child just because I had a child I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up
Never
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side
Uh-huh
A bad mother By any standards I 've thought about it you know from your side since then I know just how bad I was
Not very good
Oh really You 've got a legitimate complaint Roy I do n't deny that I was n't a very good mother when you were a kid
Oh I did n't know anything was
I know what 's bugging you of course
Oh you 'll live Lilly
You do n't know what I 'd do Roy You have no idea To live
I 'll get it
Yeah sure that sounds nice
No but I 'm goddamn thirsty Ice water
I do n't think so You probably should n't either
You want a drink
No
And to survive my way I need money Bobo knows about the stash in the car so I did n't dare touch it not if Lilly Dillon 's dead So that leaves this
I know you do so that 's why
Bobo is n't after you Bobo 's after me and he 's goddamn good But so am I I 'm a survivor Roy I survive
I thought you 'd be happy for me After all you
Roy that 's fine but I do n't have time for this Bobo
I thought it over and you were right You wanted me out of the rackets and now
What
Not any more Lilly listen I 'm giving you good advice I 'm following it myself
Roy I know what to do with myself It 's a big world out there
Well you 're gon na start if you hope to live through this A square job and a quiet life You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo 's boys will be all over you
A job I 've never had a legit job in my life
You 're smart Lilly and you 're good-looking You wo n't have any trouble finding a job
At what
Far enough Maybe up to San Francisco Or St Louis someplace new Start over
Her credit cards How far am I gon na get with that
And Myra 's stuff
Just a few bucks
You must have some money
I need this Roy I ca n't run without money and if I ca n't run I 'm dead
Do n't be sorry You 're not taking it
I 'm sorry I hated to take your money but
You 've already made a start Does n't look that clean though
It is is n't it And maybe it 's a break for me after all I 've been wanting out of the racket for years and now I 'm out I can make a clean start and
This way 's perfect
I sat in there with her I thought what do I do now Run and I 've got Bobo and the law after me Stay and how do I explain
That 's pretty funny all right What happened in Phoenix
As though you do what I say
I would n't go in on a deal with her She blamed you for it
No you would n't That 's what she was after though But why hit on me
No
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo I guess to get me running Did you tell her about my stash
Myra followed you huh
Even so You still got time Relax a minute tell me what happened Sit down
Bobo wo n't be He 'll spend the money to make sure
Why should they The cops are satisfied
Not for long Not when they do a fingerprint check
You 're dead Lilly it worked
I 've really got to
Looks very solid Lilly Sit down Take a minute tell me about it
Oh yeah Is the frame holding
I just came back from Phoenix
Somewhere else that 's for sure
Going somewhere
Well that 's good news
Well sure Roy You want me to drive up Okay fine come on down It wo n't be a home-cooked meal you know
You too Roy
Well nice to see you again Lilly
After the meet Back to Baltimore

No can do Have to dip in and out of my bag too much Besides it 'll heal in the air
You ought to put a bandage on that
No That was the point
Expecting visitors

Why
Get off the grift Roy
I tripped over a chair
You do if you 're where I am Where you want to be How 'd you get that punch in the stomach Roy
You do n't put up with that Nobody has to put up with that
He let me live He let me be his friend
Lucky You call that lucky
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money like it was the winnings from my bets I hoped that would cover me It did n't
Bluebell came in
That was my choice nothing to do with you I took a chance and it did n't work out
The first day of the Delmar meet there was a nag called Bluebell I should have been on it But that was the day after you came in here so I stuck around to see how you were gon na be
Sure
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus back in Baltimore When a long shot gets too much action I have to put money on that horse at the track because it 's the only way to get the odds down
Up to you

No history Sooner or later the lightning hits I do n't want to be around when it hits you
Bullshit
Mostly because you scare the shit out of me I 've seen people like you before baby Double-tough and sharp as they come and you get what you want or else But you do n't make it work forever
For Christ 's sake why not
What I say is no We do n't do partners
What
That 's what I say
No Because I
Do n't I get any say in this
Maybe I like it where I am
You 're too good for the small-time Roy Move up to where there 's big dough to be made and you do n't have to stick your neck out every day
I do n't think I need it
But the setup 's there It 's there now
The last I looked we were just talking things over
What
Wait a minute When did this happen that we 're partners
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa the one who plays my chauffeur There 's a sucker there he says is made for us And a boroker that just shut down we can use their office not change a thing Now I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end We could start this weekend get the sucker into position
And hello to you too
Yes or no They 're both easier at home Okay
You mean it would be too tough to give me a turndown here Easier on home grounds
Come on Myra do n't talk business here This is time out
But why not I thought it was settled What 's holding you back
Regret what I did n't say I was coming aboard
You and me Roy What a team we 'll make We think alike we get along together Once or twice a year we take some slob the rest of the time we live like this You wo n't regret this Roy
Running your broker scam you mean
I 'm well connected Roy Cole introduced me to a lot of people Very valuable Valuable for us
You must have some very knowledgeable friends
I 'm not trying to make trouble Roy It 's just she 's always so nasty to me I thought who is she to be so high and mighty I saw her out there and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore so now I know who she is
She did n't see you in other words
I saw her
The track Did you run into Lilly
I went out to Delmar
You were gone for a while
Oh come here
If you could have seen your face when I told you good night You looked so so Ah
You I do n't know
Open it and find out
What What for
Open your door
Yeah
Sure I 'm pretty tired myself
You do n't mind really do you Roy It 's been such a wonderful evening I guess I just wore myself out
Things a man is n't supposed to know
Separate bathrooms darling I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over
I still do n't see why we have to have separate rooms You expect your father to come through
Sure
Think about it Okay
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand
I do n't know Myra I never had partners I never needed them
I need a partner Roy I need an inside man and you 're it You could be as wonderful as Cole
Take a hike you mean
Join up with you I watched you Roy I 've been watching you wondering if I should talk about this at all or maybe just
I just bet you are too And now you 're trying to rope me
That 's where they keep the criminally insane is n't it
Atascadero
Upstate where
Upstate
Where
He retired
What happened to Cole
Oh Roy it was great We were rolling in dough lived wherever we wanted only pulled two or three scams a year
Yeah How
No no He never calls the cops not after we give him the blow-off
And a month later the sucker calls the cops and you 're on the run
