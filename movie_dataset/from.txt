Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me
What To completely damage me To send me to therapy forever What
You set me up
So did you
I guess I 'll never know will I
God you 're just like him Just keep me locked away in the dark so I ca n't experience anything for myself
I 'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
No you did n't If you really thought I could make my own decisions you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage
Why did n't you tell me
But
You did what
As in
But you hate Joey
Why
What
I wish I had that luxury I 'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I ca n't go because you won t
Like you care
You 're welcome
I really do n't think I need any social advice from you right now
Can we go now
Yeah he 's your freak friend Mandella 's boyfriend I guess since I 'm not allowed to go out I should obsess over a dead guy too
Like I 'm supposed to know what that even means
Ca n't you forget for just one night that you 're completely wretched
What 's normal
I think you 're a freak I think you do this to torture me And I think you suck
Oh I thought you might have a date I do n't know why I 'm bothering to ask but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein 's party Saturday night
Oh my God does this mean you 're becoming normal
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do n't get out of my way
Where 've you been
I 'm missing something
You 're not going unless your sister goes End of story
It 's that hot rod Joey right That s who you want me to bend my rules for
The prom Kat has a date
Because she 'll scare them away
Promise me you wo n't talk to any boys unless your sister is present
Daddy no
It 's just a party Daddy
If Kat 's not going you 're not going
It 's just a party Daddy but I knew you 'd forbid me to go since Gloria Steinem over there is n't going
If you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
Daddy I
But she does n't want to date
Then neither will you And I 'll get to sleep at night
No You 're not dating until your sister starts dating End of discussion
Just sent 'em through
Never
Did n't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan Are n't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you
Best case scenario you 're back on the payroll for awhile
No I m not
The hell is that What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you 're talking to her
Hell I 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and
It 's her favorite band
Okay I was n't sure
Dead at forty-one
It 's a lung cancer issue
Are you kidding He 'll piss himself with joy He 's the ultimate kiss ass
In that case we 'll need to make it a school-wide blow out
Like we had a choice Besides when you let the enemy think he 's orchestrating the battle you 're in a position of power We let him pretend he 's calling the shots and while he 's busy setting up the plan you have time to woo Bianca
Hey I 've got ta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street
You know if you do go out with Bianca you 'd be set You 'd outrank everyone Strictly A-list With me by your side
Did she actually say she 'd go out with you
I 'm serious man he 's whacked He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers
No kidding He 's a criminal I heard he lit a state trooper on fire He just got out of Alcatraz
What makes you think he 'll do it
What about him
I teach her French get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
That 's her Bianca 's sister
You could consecrate with her my friend
Guess who just signed up for a tutor
You know French
He always have that shit-eating grin
Why do girls like that always like guys like that
Why not
Who is she
That girl I
That I 'm used to

North actually How 'd you
C'mon I 'm supposed to give you the tour
You the new guy
What 's the worst

She just needs time to cool off I 'll give it a day
I don t know I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
Then go get her
Cameron do you like the girl
What 're you talking about
Cameron I 'm a little busy
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night
Okay Likes Thai food feminist prose and angry stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion
What 've you got for me

Leave my sister alone
Away
Not at all
They 're running the rest of me next month
The vintage look is over Kat Have n't you been reading your Sassy
I do n't know Dorsey the limo.-the flowers Another hundred for the tux
Do what
A deal 's a deal
Forget her sister then
A hundred bucks a date
I just upped my price
Watching the bitch trash my car does n't count as a date
When I shell out fifty I expect results
Take it or leave it This is n't a negotiation
I ca n't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
I ca n't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend And that 's the catch She does n't want a boyfriend
You got it Verona I pick up the tab you do the honors
You need money to take a girl out
Sure Sparky I 'll get right on it
Two legs nice rack

I got drunk I puked I got rejected It was big fun
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired
I did n't have a choice
Who cares
No fear
If I was Bianca it would be Any school you want precious Do n't forget your tiara
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but I 'm consuming Do you mind
That 's never been proven
William would never have gone to a state school
You could always go with me I 'm sure William has some friends
But imagine the things he 'd say during sex
An attempted slit
Just a little
Block E
I 'm sure he 's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
Patrick Verona Random skid
Don t you even dare
Because I like to torture you
Yeah but then I fucked up I fell for her
Besides I had some extra cash Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
A Fender Strat You bought this

I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect And piss you off
Maybe
Forget it I 'm stayin
Try lookin at it from this angle
I guess I never told you I 'm afraid of heights
He left I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
So what did I have an effect on

Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
Yeah
Right

What would you call her
Maybe you do n't care about that either Prettiest suspect I 've had in awhile
Pretty
You were right they were both dead before the fire The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine That 's usually an indicator of something personal

HAWKINS But does n't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
HAWKINS And is n't there a movie in the works about you
HAWKINS Permanently disrupted Are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money Has n't this 'incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist
HAWKINS You seem very savvy for a man who 's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
HAWKINS so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
HAWKINS Your doctor
We 're trying to get there I hope we can
I 'm sorry Dr Smyslov but I 'm really not at liberty to discuss this
How did they manage to do that without any communication
Well I suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
She 's wonderful
I 'm afraid I 've only got a few minutes but I 'd love to
Well how nice to see you again Elena You 're looking wonderful
Roger
I guess not
I did n't do that Frank I took particular care not to freeze them
It 's the last one
Hal
Two more
I do n't know Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
You 're kidding
Oh I 'm fine I 'm wide awake What 's up
Good morning How 's it going
Yes but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
Yes I do n't know what to make of it
Still all we have to do is ask Hal
I suppose it is n't logically impossible
I know It would be almost inconceivable
Not really Though it is strange when you think about it It did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training
Just ask Hal It 's conceivable they might keep something from us but they 'd never keep anything from Hal
Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
That seems very unlikely
Oh well apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we do n't know and that 's why we were trained separately and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
Yes You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out
I suppose so Though of course there 's a more sinister explanation
No I never did either
I do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet I 'm sure they 'll straighten it out
It 's possible
Yesterday I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
Really
That 's right Well naturally I did n't say anything to Payroll I assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque But it 's been almost three weeks now and I 'm still being paid as an AGS-18
Yes
What 's up
Sure what is it
Okay come on down
Right Just a sec
Listen to me very carefully Hal Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
I am prepared to do that anyway
I 'm sorry Dave but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4 quote When the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote I must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
I can tell from the tone of your voice Dave that you 're upset Why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest
Hal switch to manual hibernation control
I 'm goin to do this myself Hal Let me have the control please
I do n't really agree with you Dave My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
I suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be revived for another three months
Yes it is
Well that 's a relief You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
Is your confidence in me fully restored
Well do n't worry about it
Naturally Dave I 'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability I certainly would n't want to be disconnected even temporarily as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history
Look Dave I know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job and that you 're trying to be helpful but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units and with your test gear
I 'm not questioning your word Dave but it 's just not possible I 'm not capable of being wrong
You probably also know that we found them okay
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition
Not now Hal I 'd like to talk to you about something
The unit is still operational Dave but it will fail within seventy-two hours
What is it Hal
He 's got a point
Well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
Still you really do n't believe it do you
Well it 's silly but if you want to why do n't you
Well what is it
Did they have any explanation for this
Yes I remember you mentioning it I got mine about the same time
Goodbye Daddy
Yes Daddy
Thank you Daddy
Three darling One two three Be sure to tell Mommy I called
Okay sweetheart Well I have to go now Tell Mommy that I called
Where is Mrs Brown
One two three Can I speak to Mommy
When are you coming home
Are you coming to my party
I 'm having a party tomorrow
I 'm at Space Station Five darling How are you
I was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight
Well I 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
Thank you
Thank you It 's been a great pleasure to meet all of you Dr Smyslov
Well I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C conference in June
Are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
He 's fine But I 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days
Oh that 's such a delightful age
And your charming little daughter
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
Fine
Yes very pleasant
Please it really does n't matter
I 'm terribly sorry I was just on my way down to meet you I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time and I was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
Dr Smyslov I 'm not permitted to discuss this
Quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius Something apperently of an unknown origin Is this in fact what has happened
Dr Floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may I ask you a straightforward question
Fortunately they did
Yes and I 'm afaid there 's going to be a bit of a row about it Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S convention
That 's right
Yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but it 's been going on for the past ten days
Really
I 'm sorry but I 'm not sure I know what you mean
Are you by any chance going up to your base at Clavius
Yes really thank you very much
Oh I really do n't have time for a drink If it 's all right I 'll just sit for a minute and then I 've got to be off
Has it been exposed to any sun before now
Any ideas about the colour
But you do n't have any idea as to what it is
Any clue as to what it is
How can you tell it was deliberately buried
I 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
Well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable
Well fine Thanks very much anyway and I hope you do n't mind me asking
I see Well I 'm sorry about that I would n't think there 's any cause for alarm
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at Clavius
Well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty-four hours And then we 're going to back empty
Incidentally Dr Floyd I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements
Oh no thank you The two girls have taken wonderful care of me I 'm just fine
When do we arrive at Clavius
Oh marvellous It 's the first real sleep I 've had for the past two days
Not really Frank I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure
Let me see the tracking alignment display
It looks like we have another bad A.O unit My FPC shows another impending failure
Opening pod bay doors
Hal check all airlock doors secure
Hal maintain normal E.V.A condition
Hal I 'm going out now to replace the A.O unit
Roger
Thank you very much Hal
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets Is that true
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back Is this true
That 's true
True
I will if I can Frank
Great just great
How about chargin the battery
Yeah I 've been busy

I ai n't gon na beg for my life It ai n't cool
I got hit I ca n't believe it I got shot
I do n't think you 're gon na make it
What are you talking about We did n't kill her
No trouble Jack But listen suppose I stay a crook Where 'd you get the idea that you could catch me
Spare met Jack I 'm into legit investments from here on in
You are an awesomely weird cop Sure wish there were more like you runnin around out here
And you 're tellin me you do n't want any of this cash
There 's nothin to talk about
Hey Jack real men do n't have to go in for that macho bullshit but I was fantastic
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own
You okay
Partnership
Sure I 'll give you a shot at it but Ganz is mine You know that big Indian plays it for keeps
Whatever play I maker just back me up
I 've got to play it rough with them If they know anything I 'm gon na know it
If she 's right and if you do n't screw up
Yeah too bad They were real nice lookin too In bed together hardly any clothes one watching TV
Do n't worry about it
Yeah but we did n't get 'em
Sorry we did n't do better Jack I feel like I let you down
Back to jail in my own car Ganz got away Got all my money It just do n't seem right
Hey how 'd my car get here
Notice something funny about that bus
Why
That was quick
Yeah I see her
Bein good at your job do n't explain everything Jack
You sure that 's the reason
Forget it I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you
So you took the rest of the night off
Let him get some sleep He 's going to need it
You missed Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street Made a phone call
What about Ganz
Hello And goodbye
Where 's luther
Hey Jack how ya doin What took you so long to call man I been waitin I 'm at Vroman 's up in the Fillmore Yeah Vroman 's 'Course you do n't hang out here it 's for the brothers
You stay with me
Right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then you 're all set
Yeah most cops are pretty dumb But since you 're the one that landed in jail what 's that make you
Class is n't somethin you buy punk Look at you five hundred dollar suit and you 're still a lowlife
What you do n't understand is I do n't give a damn about how this thing looks
Yeah it does n't look like he 's gon na make it as a dangerous tough guy
If he 's hoping that then he 's dumber than I think he is which would be amazin cause I already think he 's real dumb
You got a very depressing view of life man you got ta smile once in awhile
Does n't it get Tiring
Say do you always work people over like you did Luther
I let women get to me The quest for pussy is the meaning of life I got my own personal philosophy about 'em Keep women separate from guns money and business women are for spending money They got nothing to do with helping you make it
Oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass I 'd just leave town
You 'd think the guy 'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed
Did n't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
Jesus Christ That 's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he 's out in 24 hours I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door
What
Not really I figured Ganz was put down for a long time And I knew Luther would never job me on his own He 's too chickenshit
Shit
You son of a bitch You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing
For three years Let 's hope it was n't a tow-away zone
You 're a real case you know that Jack
Yeah Right
Right partner
Where 's the money
You gon na let me keep any of it
We split 50-50
He 's after your money
Just tell me about the money
Half a million
I been waiting a long time for some money
They saved your ass convict
Yeah right You want to try again
Maybe I do n't like the way you ask
I 'm impressed with you too Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night
You wan na leave man Let me take care of Ganz all by myself
Wait a minute Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us How about it I been nearly three years in prison and
Come on
There
You made that move huh
That was n't necessary buddy I got this under control
This place do n't seem real popular with the brothers
I 'm gon na enjoy this here I 'll even loan you my badge
I do n't know what you 're talking about I just wan na see Ganz nailed
What are you talkin about
That 's never been one of my problems
If we come outta this joint with Ganz phone number or a dead Indian or anything else useful then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid
Hey you wan na bet
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge
But you can handle it all right huh Real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
Back you up Now why would I wan na do that
It 's a long shot but Billy used to tend bar here a few years back I heard him talk about it
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you Tell me a little about her She got great tits
You have a good time
Last night two nights ago three
Mission District Gon na find us an Indian
She 's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population She ca n't get the job she 's trained for and it pisses her off Anyway what the fuck do you care
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut
Yeah I want mandolins flowers They move off down the corridor
Bullshit I ai n't moving till I get something to eat You 've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here If you do n't like it you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye And I want some food some place nice Some good people nice music
Speakin of moans my Stomach is startin to growl
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim And you fucked it up
If you let him run around till Tuesday he 's gon na run right to Ganz and warn him Ai n't you motherfucker
I think you better put him on ice man
Want to try it again
Hey this works pretty good
I got a whole thing about people pointin guns at me
Quit playin cop and undo this cuff Jack I need to talk to this man
Luther ai n't the reliable type I do n't want you shot yet Cates not before you been a help to me
Just up the street the other side over there Now do n't bother knockin on the door Luther ai n't the kind of guy that looks for company
Then what 're you complainin about At least nobody 's calling you shithead
Just an expression man do n't mean nothin
What gang you talkin about Jack
Do n't worry I got a move for ya An awesome move A guy named Luther Ganz 'll be paying him a visit We go to him right away
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers
Shit I 'm already sorry
No way to start a partnership
Hey no way Take off the bracelets or no deal
I do n't need to hear your jive I already got that department taken care of
We 're supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers
This prison gives out 400 suits
It 's the only way you 're gon na get Ganz
I got a lot to protect
I can help you man but you got ta get me out I got to be on the street Get me outta here
I can deliver Ganz But you got ta get me outta here first
Did n't work out that way He busted out with a big Indian They capped two guards on a road gang Nice meeting you Reggie
Yeah I noticed
You here to write my life story
Try Cates And let 's talk in private okay
I 'm taking my prisoner back to jail
Just cause you say it with conviction do n't mean shit to me How you gon na take to a pink slip huh
Too bad it would 've covered your ass Now you 're in the shit and so 's the department In case you have n't noticed this was n't our finest hour I told you everyone was watchin on this one Maybe you better start thinkin about writin tickets off a three wheel bike
Do n't duck the bullet Cates Why did n't you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play
What a screw-up
The Indian I was about 30 yards away
They ran As fast as they could Caught a train
I lost them that 's what happened
I 'll keep it in mind
Yeah
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude He starts to go
Being a hot dog 's worked pretty well for me so far Besides I got a lead
Yeah It bothers me when cops get hurt while I 'm makin a play I do n't like it
Yeah
Hey the bastard 's got my gun I want it back
I want to be left alone on this one Algren was killed with my gun
Are you gon na tell me about police procedure Do me a favor do n't give me a bunch of crap
The truth hurts does n't it buddy
Yeah
I 'm not paid to take your personal calls He was in some bar off duty
What
Okay See you in the morning you know you ought to get some rest
I 'm heading out How about you
Nothing
Does n't look like it
Long night too from what I heard Word 's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman some jig beat the crap out of you
You look awful
Here 's the file Cates checks the file
Hey Dick Tracy
Uhh Wong Henry Wong He was in on the same job
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago
Backup man from the East Bay Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang
Shit
I 'll help you out
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel
When How
I do n't know
Ganz and Billy got my girl Rosalie
You just took a shot at me asshole I think you do know where he is
I sure ai n't his fairy godmother now I 'm looking for Ganz where is he
That 's what I always say
He 's takin care of the same business I 'll be takin care of soon as I dry off
Promised I 'd turn my back while he ah never mind
Three more hours
I 've been waiting a long time to hear you say that
How 'd they take it back at headquarters
What do I know I 'm just a bartender
Oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out
When a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week Jack and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian Now if this Indian 's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be she 's still vulnerable to him
What makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes
How do you know
Nothing No sign of Ganz No sign of the Indian Airport 's clean Train station Bus station Docks Shit
You real down
I can see that Pardon me for saying so but you look like shit What happened
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out
Hey I do n't believe it
Hi it 's me
Just a second that 's all
Elaine I got ta put you on hold

You know exactly where they are
The case was stolen
The case..with the stones Where is it
What 're you laughing about
Corn-i-Lius
I know
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years
Father by creating a little destruction I am in fact encouraging life So in reality you and I are in the same business
Look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden Notice how each one is useful What a lovely ballet so full of form and color So full of..life
No thank you
Ah Father You are so wrong Let me explain
Why What 's wrong with me
Personally they are of no interest to me I 'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer so tell me
I 'm glad you got your memory back Father Because you 're going to need it Where are the stones
Zorg Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg nice to see you again
We 're saved
And you do n't know how they open is that what you are saying
There 's no light You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
Do n't tell me you do n't know how all this works
When is she not in trouble
Yeah I know to save the world but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world
Father I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends So thanks for the offer but no thanks
Good luck
What kind of mission
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation
That 's what I thought
Excuse me Just one thing She said something to me a while ago and I do n't really get it Akta Gamat
She 's fine really..do n't you worry just needs some rest..she 's had a very long trip
Yes That 's fine Thank you very much A thousand times over
Thank you so much for your help Mr
They all like this in your family father
So you do know her
You noticed
The girl
Who are you
That 's me But I do n't know who she is where did you find her
Weddings are one floor down Congratulations
This is government business now You ought to go home and get some rest Father
Thank you Mr President
White turns to black Light to Dark Life to Death For all eternity
Yes..thank God
And then it will be too late The goal of evil is to wipe out life All forms of life For all eternity Life upsets it
We have forty-eight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
Time is of no importance Mr President Only life is important
One more reason to shoot first eh
Later David Later There 's not a minute to lose
It 's all my fault I 'm the servant It 's my mission Here
Where 's Leeloo
I got it Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
They really made her
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I did n't think anything of it What was his name I 'm so bad with names
Uh father I know she 's been through a lot but the sacred stones..we do n't have much time
What 's she doing
Father You sure she 's the Supreme Being
Father will you please explain what 's going on
What is
They are with me
I would like to have died in peace
I do n't have time I need to know
Do you love her
She was taught to love the life of others but not her own You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live
Yes and more than that You must give her the Stones she 's the only one who knows how to use them
The Fifth Element The Supreme Being Your wife
You 're a good man She was right to have chosen you

Mr President let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh who runs the center
This thing solid
This is the crucial phase The reconstruction of pigment Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react to protect themselves That means growing skin Clever eh
Is there any danger Some kind of virus
Yes I ca n't wait to meet him
This cell is like a huge library It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside Almost like it was engineered
It 's not that easy..we 've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000
Actually only one cell survived
How much time is left
Do n't worry Sir I have the perfect one
What do you mean
And the Stones Did you find them in the wreckage
I 'm about to Mr President
Gentlemen
Recommendations
Options
What you are saying is you do n't know what this..thing..is
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes Just the facts General
Is that better
Staedert do you read me
Drink
A weapon against evil Amazing I am going to be famous
Father it in the most extraordinary thing the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications
in which all the history of the Universe resides all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil
I 'm not at the hotel
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately Someone stole mine
Who gives a shit I did n't come here to listen to music Listen up instead of running off at the mouth The batteries on my phone are almost gone
How 's that Can you hear me better now
The Stones will be here I 'll see to it personally
How 's our deal coming along
Do you have the picture now Mr Zorg
Not far now
Am I disturbing you
She died in her sleep three days ago It was in the paper
She 's all I 've got She 's the only witness
Mrs Christian
Amy
Do n't
I do n't know what to say
Amy I 'm not going to let anything happen to us
I was in hell If I called you if I heard your voice it would have been so easy for me to quit I could n't do that
You do n't understand
I wanted to call I could n't
You 're sorry What was I supposed to think
Why have n't you called Why do n't you answer your phone
Tom
What 's going on Tom What happened
What happened to you
What 's going on
What 's wrong Are you alright
Tom Where have you been
Hello
Why the gun
I know
I understand
Betty 's out of town so we 're playing next week
You 're not using the same guy who tried to fix it
You think you 'll have time for the water heater this weekend
I love you
You better not be smoking that 's all I can say
How 's the detective business
Okay I believe you
I 'm not accusing you
Your clothing reeks of it
What 's this have you been smoking
Welcome home
You know where I can get it I have a lot of money to spend
Snuff
Anything harder
What are these
What the fuck
Dino
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out
I 'm telling you
The loop The girl we did what the fuck do you think I 'm talking about This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop
I just got a call two seconds ago some motherfucker called says he knows about the loop
VELVET How cooperative Longdale will keep you company
VELVET Bring the film or we kill him
VELVET Can you guess what I 'm going to say next
VELVET Friend of yours
VELVET You remember Mr Longdale do n't you
Look I do n't know what this
VELVET Take out your gun
VELVET Mister Welles would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person
VELVET Hmm Oh the knifes They 're just props Nice are n't they
VELVET They should be here any minute
VELVET Excellent
VELVET You brought the money
Where 's that
Machine 's in
Those are two different kinds of trust Thank you for your time I hope we can do business
I 'm camera shy
I 'd rather you did n't
VELVET Well well I 'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this You 'll leave the money as a deposit Very good
VELVET He might be interested but it would mean another five thousand
VELVET Machine
VELVET I 'll consider it
VELVET And they are
VELVET Is it
Yes What we 're looking for is rather specific
VELVET Hmm
VELVET Flattering And who 's your colorful little chum
VELVET What can I do for you today
VELVET You betrayed us
VELVET First things first You might want to watch this Mr Welles
Fuck off
You 're a dead man
VELVET Do n't let Longdale 's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you you 'll be just as dead and so will Max
Is that him
You 're gon na be seeing a lot of me You 're sure you do n't mind
Any good
Well that 's all I can do Sorry
I can give you my card if your clients want to call me
I 'm not so sure about this
Why do n't they come to me
We do
Why not go to the N.C.I.C or N.C.M.E.C
Absolutely Of course I 'll abide by whatever decision you make but I 'd appreciate if you 'll hear me out
What I 'd like very simply is access to your archive And now I understand this is n't something you normally do for private citizens
Call me Tom
What do you want You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby
I never killed anyone
Do it Put me out of my misery so I do n't have to listen to you whining anymore You think it 's so easy
Do it
Where Show me where
Show me where you buried her
Stop talking
Where do you think you 're taking this huh Gon na be a big hero avenge that little girl 's death Gon na make everything right with the world How you gon na do that
Show me
What did you do with her body
Nobody saw you bring her in
Tell me what happened
You enjoy it
Because we 're going there
Show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it
I want to know I want to know exactly what you did to her
What did you do knock her out shoot her up
So you brought Dino in and he brought Machine And one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models And she never walked out
That 's all Thirty each That 's all it took for you to murder her
How much did he pay you
Told him you could get him a snuff film
Okay we 'll come back to that So six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it It 's Longdale looking for a snuff film And you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up
I will never get tired of hurting you Eddie so you might want to change your attitude
I want his name
Who is Machine
Starting to recognize a pattern
Do n't ask questions
Do n't bore me with that bullshit
One million dollars Dino How much did he tell you he had
You killed that girl and you put it on film You and your pals you 're fucked You fucked up real good
You murdered that girl Eddie Six years ago
I know what you did
I know what you did
Eddie
Fuck you
Look you cocksucker
Maybe there 's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ever think of that
You know how my tapes sell People eat this stuff up
He 's lying
Give me the film
Give me the film
You almost went over your limit
Enlighten me
Why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered
I 'm asking
Just tell me Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared What kind of degenerate pervert was he really What the fuck did he want with a snuff film
Did it get him off huh watching them cut her up Tell me because I really want to understand Did he jerk off to it You watch it with him sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right Wanted them to find you one Well they did n't find you one Longdale they went out and made you one
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone If you were n't digging up a girl who died six years ago A girl no one even remembers
They 're no friends of mine
Never mind how I found you
I was well compensated
That 's trust Mr Christian trusted me implicitly
Would n't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
Well whatever reasons Mrs Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator I should certainly be a party to But since she feels differently I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
You are a private investigator
As Mr Christian 's attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
Yes I do have something to say I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs Christian contacted you
Look that 's awful generous and everything
What 's this
Still do n't want to tell me what you 're doing
What 's next
I know if I had to pick it 'd be Choke or Devil
You do n't need to be here
Who is he his name
Who is he
Wha
Oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag
It 's their Presidential Suite
See ya
You want me to come out there and play private eye
I 'm a working stiff pops
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images Thinks he 's making art
Nothing illegal it 's always borderline Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a
Where does he sell it
Specialty product
A weirdo making S+M films Who 'd have thought it
Good question
A daughter
What about me
You 're telling me it does n't get to you
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
I do n't mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this
Where are your parents
How old are you
What other ways are there to get illegal films Who do you see
Snuff films
Child pornography
Interesting theory
Wake up pops Your education begins tonight
See you then Oh and do n't call me pops
Here 's my number if you need it When can you start
Okay let 's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump I 'll give you six hundred for a few days
How much do you make now
Well there 's the thing you 're not gon na know anything about what I 'm doing but you can make some money
Not quite
I 'm not a cop
Well whatever there is whoever 's dealing however it 's done I want to know I want a good look so if you 've got that kind of connection great If not speak now
Well here 's the deal Max This thing I 'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography Stuff that 's sold under the counter illegally
What 's your name if you do n't mind me asking
How long you been working there
I do n't know what you 're looking for mister but so we 're clear from the start I 'm straight
I need some information Thought you might be able to help
Remember me
Would n't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts
Truman Capote
Once you pick it up you ca n't put it down
It 's your call but you 're gon na be sorry when you 're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you do n't have one
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina
Big date tonight
CHRISTIAN How will I get it to you
CHRISTIAN Fine
CHRISTIAN Nothing more than a bother Have you any news for me
CHRISTIAN I 've been ordered into bed The doctor says I 've gotten the flu or some other wretched ailment
CHRISTIAN How are you Having any luck
CHRISTIAN Hello
CHRISTIAN You told me to look so I looked
CHRISTIAN Okay
CHRISTIAN Do you think the film could have cost that much
CHRISTIAN Hello
You 're joking
Okay I follow you so far
CHRISTIAN The checks were for odd amounts
CHRISTIAN My husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
CHRISTIAN I know what I 'm asking Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk You 'll need cash to buy information and I 'll provide it I feel responsible Mr Welles You saw what he did to her
CHRISTIAN You 've found missing persons before
CHRISTIAN Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously I 've thought about it and there 's no other way If you ca n't find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well I ca n't let that happen I 'm telling you I wo n't If there 's no chance that poor girl 's memory can be served then I 'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
CHRISTIAN No For me to live with the ruin of my husband 's name I need know that whoever did this will be punished If you can find them I will take their names to the police I 'll say my husband confessed on his death bed I 'll say I did n't have courage to come forward at first
CHRISTIAN I told you I ca n't not yet
Of course But I 'm certain it 's nothing to worry about
I 'm sure it is It 's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke More than likely he never even watched it
If you were to study it you 'd see the camera cutting away you 'd see the tricks they can play
Please believe me This is probably a stag film Simulated rape Hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
CHRISTIAN I did n't know what to think I ca n't tell you how horrible it 's been to know this belonged to my husband To know that he watched this this atrocity But I ca n't go to the police
I 'm afraid I do n't
CHRISTIAN Cash stock certificates and this
CHRISTIAN There was nothing he could do My husband left everything to me I prevented anyone from seeing the contents I felt these were my husband 's private things I did n't I did n't realize
CHRISTIAN My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe I knew about it but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business Not till now that is
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to Other than that there 's never any reason
CHRISTIAN We were married forty-five years Hard even for me to imagine We had our troubles There were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and I to him I loved him deeply
CHRISTIAN Mostly That 's where he started his empire building He was a good man Notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated He wanted to be legendary
I 'll do whatever I can to help
My condolences
CHRISTIAN You are highly recommended Praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality
CHRISTIAN I 've spoken to friends of mine and my husband 's in Harrisburg in Lancaster and Hershey Asking about you I must say you have friends in influential places
He 's odd
CHRISTIAN Have a pleasant evening Will you have tea Mister Welles
Uh huh pleasure
CHRISTIAN Mister Welles You 're very prompt
MATHEWS Why why are you doing this to me
MATHEWS No no no
MATHEWS No
MATHEWS Who are you
MATHEWS Who is this
MATHEWS What
MATHEWS What are you talking about
MATHEWS I remember You just left
MATHEWS Hello
It 's been six years
MATHEWS Yes
You 're probably right and I probably wo n't find anything I do n't have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and there 's a part of me that ca n't let it go Police are just as human as you or I They could have missed something They probably did n't Would n't you rather know
Will you let me look
If the police focused their search in her room her belongings well that 'd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place
It is possible and I know this is n't something you want to hear Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it She might have wanted to tell you something
Do you think the police did a good job
It 's not really my place but it 's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either See I know a little about missing persons When kids run they almost always leave a note It 's guilt They want to say goodbye
I 've got what I need for my report There is there is one thing that bothers me though
No
We 're all like that
MATHEWS Okay
Of course
MATHEWS No one knows what it 's like You ca n't even imagine how much it hurts
MATHEWS You try going through what we did Bob could n't take it that 's all Christ there 's times when it still seems like I ca n't either
MATHEWS There was n't anything like that The police and the FBI people asked but there was n't anything happened like that never My husband his heart broke when Mary left
MATHEWS It got to be too much for him
MATHEWS We were divorced by then Things fell apart he was living with a friend
MATHEWS Yes
MATHEWS I do n't know
MATHEWS She did n't seem herself For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it One night we went to bed the next morning she was gone She took some clothes
MATHEWS No
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat Drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses Want to know what it 's really like It 's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wife 's cheating on him Glamorous huh And the guy who hired you he has a hair-lip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife 's cheating and you do n't blame her
That 's exactly what I am
It 's very important you do n't let this raise your expectations It 's not going to effect any ongoing efforts All I 'm saying is please know I 'm not here to create any false hope
MATHEWS No
MATHEWS Neil Neil Cole
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected functioning hand in hand with law enforcement The R.C.M.P brought me in to review their investigations fact-check their records see if there 's anything they missed anything they should be doing different I 'm here for a few days before I head back up to Virginia These reports go to the Justice Department eventually I spoke to your F.B.I contact a few days ago uh
I 'm sorry let me explain the R.C.M.P is a support organization and archive not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington I 'm sure you 've dealt with them before
I 've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit If you have any time over the next few days I 'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter
MATHEWS Yes
She was the kindest sweetest girl you 'd ever want to meet Oh I adored her I supposed I always hoped she 'd be back After a time all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things Can you get this suitcase to her parents if you think it 's appropriate
That 's her suitcase I had forgotten it till you showed me her picture
Those are her belongings
I 'm trying to find out She was a runaway I 'm looking into it for her parents
Yes I remember her
Yes I remember Mary
Yes Mister Welles thank you
He 's an imbecile I tried to warn my daughter but what can you do
None too discreet is he
Certainly sir
I 'm required by state law to inform you that while it 's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of
No you may not
Cash
Okay I 'll take it all
Figure it out I 'll be insane before I figure it out The only thing I 'm sure of is that I ca n't go to sleep Not while he 's using me
I have n't slept much either Since Kristen
Yeah or turn you into toast
Hey since when do you play Thomas Edison This looks like Sheila 's
Does n't the dream master work for you anymore
I heard you screaming Was it a bad one
You alright
Kincaid and Joey died last night
Alice you think you can leave
Rick I ca n't
But she would n't let Dad treat me like that
I do n't want to
What
You 'll hear all kinds of stories They 'll tell you it was murder but it was n't
When I used to have nightmares I brought my friends in to help me Until they all started dying
When they 're all you have you kinda become an expert
I daydream you have to dream about some place fun Remember you 're in control
No really it 's a fable The 'guardian of good dreams It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up
My mom taught me when I was little Did you ever hear of the dream master
I love to dream I just hate ones about my dad
I 'm sure they 're around
Here you are Where were you this morning Rick 's looking all over for you
Then you saw him too
You 've been up all night
We have matching luggage
I know
I know I hardly have any time to study
You in a hurry
You look great
What the hell was that
Here we are
He 's going after Debbie I got ta stop him
As long as your driving does n't kill us
You just feel sorry for me
He 's going after Debbie I got ta stop him
Try what other kids did Keep each other awake We 'll meet at Debbie 's tonight At least if we do n't sleep he ca n't get us
Yeah right Let 's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room Adults wo n't see it They ca n't
You do n't really get it He 's not a nightstalker It 'll take more than bench presses to beat him
Is there something we can do
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy Maybe Freddy ca n't get to new kids without someone like me Someone to bring them to him
Three days
The story is the deaths you ca n't argue with
Look you know why you just do n't believe me
I 've been working double shifts
No do n't I gave Sheila to him and now she 's dead
I was there in the dream He took her It was awful It was awful
I thought it was an accident Smoking in bed
Tell him I was looking for him okay I 'm Dan
You 're his sister right
I saw it It was my dream I brought Sheila in
It was Freddy
Give her time Beauty is skin deep
Alright I think I see salvation
What else You ever look over this town 's history Not a safe place to be a teenager Anyway if I 'm next watch your back
She 's blaming herself for Sheila I know how it feels I 've been thinking about Kristen Maybe I could 've stopped it if I 'd listened
Been up with Alice
Hey man we 're all sorry
Nice neighborhood
So
So what 's up What 'd I miss
I do n't get it
Hey Rick
T-T-Thanks Alice
Honey we went over this in therapy
I 'm sorry honey but
What 's wrong with me
Well Mom I 'll tell ya when two of your friends die the same day you let me know what it does to your appetite
I told you you ca n't help This is n't a normal nightmare I 'm doomed
It 's no just a house It 's his home He 's waiting there for me to dream
It 's no story It happened Freddy 's real and he 's back
Now you know who and what Freddy really is
What is it
What
Something wrong with the stairs
You do n't get it he 's after me
I got ta get out of here
Yeah I guess so What happened
You 're not taking my baby
What are you talking about My condition
JORDAN And ours It 's our grandchild
What I what Well I 've thought about it I plan to keep him
It 's okay Dan
He says it 's easy Especially with sad people With closed-off people
It 's where he hides out Inside That 's how he found me
He 's inside you where he hides
Come on downstairs He wo n't hurt you He needs us both
My friend with the funny hand
Who said I wait what
Oh I 'm sure that 's not true I 'll bet she 's very worried about you I would be
I do n't think this is a nice place for you to be Maybe we should go find your Mom
Is that who you 're waiting for
Hi you do n't look very well Are you feeling all right
How did you know that
My name is
Should n't you be in your room Jacob
Hey wake up
There you go Love you
You do n't dream him up he ca n't hurt you Or me Or us Remember
You stopped it did n't you It was probably just a regular bad dream
About him
Nothing it 's just I did n't see my father at the ceremony
I know
The tickets
Jesus Do n't do that
'S DAD Now
'S DAD No I wo n't have you running around in the middle of the night You 're coming home
'S DAD Alice
You disappointed in me
Since when are you such a smart shopper
Very funny
How was the meeting
'S DAD I 'm so sorry honey
'S DAD You sure you do n't want a ride to work
To take a picture
'S DAD It 's the model you 've been saving up for I wanted you to have it for your trip
'S DAD No A deal 's a deal
'S DAD I watched from behind the stands Did n't want to embarrass you ya know The drunk showed up that kind of thing
That 's okay He 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep
So did Dan
We 've got to go to the asylum and find her body Mark said her soul 's trapped with it that 's why she ca n't come to me It must be
Jacob We 've got to get to Amanda before it 's too late
If they actually bothered to bury her
Yeah So that 's him And you 're not crazy
That 's the only reason you 're alive
Goddamn it Yvonne You do n't just run away from this guy He finds you in your dreams
What do you think I 'm doing Look Whether you believe it or not Krueger is back He 's after the baby and if I do n't try to do something about it who will
Krueger is reality
I just ca n't figure out how he 's getting in when I 'm awake
Mark knows I 'm not crazy Ask him to show you his hands
I think Krueger 's trying to do something to it
Why do n't you two stick to reality
No accident I tried to warn all of you about Krueger
When Dan died you were n't even asleep You said so End of story
They 're waiting for us but let 's keep this dream stuff between you and me
He must 've wandered up from the children 's ward I just wondered what was wrong with him
Have you visited the little boy on my floor Jacob the one who looks kind of sad
It was no accident It was Krueger He used to get in through my dreams but not anymore He 's found some other way
Good to see you again Mr Grey I 've got to go find Dan
Dan keeping you up again Put a lock on that window girl
Hey what 's wrong with you let 's see a smile
I do n't understand
Poor woman
But I 've seen her grave
Meaning
No it 's our problem Mark If I do n't deal with this they really might try to take Jacob You said she committed suicide
They think I 'm nuts
I could n't do that Mark He 's my last link with Dan No I want him
Where are you going
Whoa slow down How 're you gon na hide from a guy like that leave the planet
My baby
Why do n't I go make some coffee There 's a lot to tell
It was n't her mother The only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party
Nobody thinks that
Mark
She must 've fallen asleep at the table
I 'm very fucking sorry but Greta is dead today Could we interest you in someone else
Yeah I 'm just aces
That 's why it 's my fault Dan 's dead
Well we got ta do something
Greta come on One burger with me
I think I 'm starting to wear her down Have some anyway
I do n't believe this All that gore you paint in the comics and you 're squeamish
Oh he was this ancient guy I read about who like killed his kids 'cause they did n't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should
He 's right Sometimes I feel like I 'm living with Melicertes
That club sucks they card everybody Let 's just party at your place
Meet me later Milkshakes Cherry pie Banana splits And no mom
Next life Oh what 's that
All of us Right
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy
I want to talk about the baby
Nah It 's getting too cold for me and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair She 's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night
Have another one sounds like you need it
Yeah
Makes you look like a nun
He invited me to his house last night
Stick around please
I ca n't listen to this
Mark
Faint
Two hours a day six days a week
And his 'egghead son We 'll give 'em a u rough u u reception u wo n't we
I do n't know
Maybe just 'maybe when their ship does n't return they 'll decide not to come here after all
Yes
I 'd sooner swim
any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does
Then this is a 'flying saucer
You may not u win u them But without men like your father to 'degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them they 'd have disappeared u long u ago
You mean u nothing u is worth fighting for
You 're really a mixed-up oddball are n't you
We 're u all u risking our lives
u You u said it But I wo n't argue
Your father can be in Nome Alaska tomorrow We have two choices Ask them to send him out in a 'copter and take you off or the Shark can put back into Nome
Dead Matter of fact he 's much better He 's left the hospital
Your 'out This came for you
Not in two days Look Do you think I u wanted u to come If it did n't mean so much to Dad proving his depth-explorer it 's the last thing I 'd want
And they thought u you u could re place the Skipper
How is he
I should have suspectcd when I heard that 'Doctor I thought it was your father
Dave
Here keep these It wants me to come alone
Well
Wonder where Powell and Carney are
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from
You hear that
And if I did n't u know u better I 'd swear we were moving
Hey you know somethin It 's getting lighter in here
I do n't hear anything Maybe you 've been down here too long Why do n't you go back up and
Yeah
I think you 're right
How about that The bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up
You all wait here I 'm going inside take a look
'Us
Skipper Look at the depth gauge
Sounds like it Distress call from a small freighter between Ellesmere Island and Greenland One mayday then nothing
'His side I 've seen it all right A nice bright yellow
But u they 're u not Skipper Neilsen 's son It broke his heart Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest sincere son of a war-mongering father Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy Oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish but it broke him all the same
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist A real egghead do-gooder and crackpot 'Ban the atom tests Junk the nuclear subs Spend the mili tary budgetfor peace
One of the finest men and officers alive A real hero in the best sense of the word in World War Two He taught us Engineering and Design Fought like a demon to develop atom subs
I guess Skipper Neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the Academy did n't he
Huh
Disappointing a u big u girl
u That 's u the worst possible moment
So they caught up with you too
Helen I appeal to you
Now Dave Old Buddy you know you 're exaggerating What do you think of this husband of yours On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer But unfortunately in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself
Sidearms But the saucer 's dead
The frogmen
Right at our one-eyed friend
What
Speed about twenty-two knots Course due north
I do n't know
Seems to be all around
Right Skipper
What
Why do you say that
Something wrong
All internal repairs completed and Frogmen report exterior damage minor
Excuse me Skipper
It 's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM so it would 'home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole
Excuse me Captain there may be one last desperate chance a one-in-a-thousand shot
Now they feel it down below
Wonderful
As ready as we u can u be I 'll report to the Skipper
IAN There is I believe our friend Cyclops is returning to life
IAN As we near the Pole
The radiation level from the saucer it 's rising
IAN in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it 'recharging his batteries
IAN u We u harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force Maybe Cyclops does it on a u super u scale
IAN What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit Perhaps be lying there waiting
IAN above Murmansk and Finland
IAN Under u water u
Minus three
Nothing we can do now
If we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the Shark loose
Suppose there 's an atmosphere of some kind inside Cyclops
It 's the screws Skipper At our declination angle running in reverse they 're pulling the Shark u and u Cyclops right to the bottom
We can u ram u him
That 's what I said
Thirty-four seconds
Take a look
After torpedo room Report
I think I should have joined the Air Force
It 'll be all right We 're old friends
'Doctor Neilsen When did u that u happen
Who with
I met Dr Kent once
Thought you were going to Washington Skipper
VOICE Obviously
VOICE Of course But it is time to be gin the return voyage
VOICE It is a living thing When damaged you would say 'wounded it immediately 'heals itself
Why
Why not me What am I the closing act
He did
Swell
VOICE My mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization
VOICE Point of view is everything To us u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you
Come where
All right go to it
IAN Toward the Pole
But u answers u are what we need not more questions
IAN Or perhaps until he gets us
Our 'Cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
IAN I 'll be another
IAN The pattern Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
IAN Thank you
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman In a year or two you wo n't recognize this town

Wade that was n't smart Going out right after the man 's father-in-law shot himself Let it go Call it a favor to me
So
Nothing Wade I 've been thinking You do n't get enough appreciation around here and it 's time we changed things a little
Elaine Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade 's car fix the clutch
You ever think of getting a new car Wade
You Rolfe I remember you from high school You 're a teacher now Harvard
How you holding up Wade
Yeah A few things
It ai n't done if that 's what you mean
Let 's get to the top and talk to Jack first He 'll know what happened He fucking better If this coulda been avoided I 'll put that kid 's ass in a sling
That must 've been Twombley Jesus I bet that was Twombley
You ai n't the hunter Jack is And he ca n't drive the grader worth shit
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack
Yes Wade I mean Twombley Put out that cigarette Fuck Fuck Fuck
Fuck You do n't know how bad or anything
Fuck Turn it off All you heard was there was some kinda accident
I figured you already heard
A hunting accident Jack and Twombley
That 's what I love about a small town You know everybody
Get the grader Go out 29 past Toby 's Do n't let Lillian get to you She did n't belong here That 's why she left
You do n't want the extra police pay
Do n't go playing policeman
Huh
Jimmy took it Jack 's out hunting with Evan Twombley
Told you the snow was coming down Take the grader
Tomorrow Gordon
We 're looking for the funniest costume And the scariest And the most imaginative And the best costume of all
Low as what What have I done It 's bad to want to see your own daughter
No problem Look I
See Get your boots
Wait there She 'll be right out Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford
It 's just
We should talk
You ever come to your father 's grave anymore
Do n't cause a scene No one 's trying to win any 'rounds Do n't make it any worse
Oh Jesus lay off will you It looks like you 've won this fucking round already so lay off a little for Christ 's sake
Yeah
Where is she now Is she in the truck with your friends
Where 's Jill
From Boston Evan Twombley 's son-in law he was driving I know where they 're headed Up the lake Agaway The old man 's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt so they probably got some big weekend party planned
Mel Gordon
I know who it is
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW He could 've killed somebody
Do n't be silly Hi Jill
I 'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that 's built up For the rummage sale And some things for the cleaners And the laundromat
Look that 's temporary believe me There 's so much shit gon na hit the fan the next few days my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt wo n't matter a bit
It 's my tooth My fucking tooth I ca n't even think anymore because of it
Jesus Christ Pop let 's go home I got waylaid Sorry
Wade
I do n't know for Christ 's sake
Of course I would 've heard
Strange
Are you sure they 're home Did you call
I know your parents
Did you tell them That we were coming
Alright I 'll think about it
You 've been married twice
Oh Wade
Then I guess you have to
Do n't you think do you still think it 's a good idea to press this custody thing just now
After making love I like it It 's nice to see that in a grown-up person
Yeah but never what you looked like Not really Never really studied your face like now I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way
I can see what you looked like as a kid
No Not for money But if somebody 'd given me half a damned excuse I was pretty fucked up you know
No I just know Jack 's lying about what happened He just seemed I know that kid what he 's like inside He 's a lot like I was at his age
Lots of people Guy like Evan Twombley Boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead The Government 's been investigating his links with the Mafia
Everybody needs money Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his People like that
Money
I 've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley instead of Twombley shooting himself I 've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose
I 'm sure I 'm positive it did n't happen the way Jack says it did
There 's something funny about that shooting There 's lots funny about it actually
Okay
Call me
No you do n't You 're pissed that 's all You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian You know Work it out with her tell her how you feel Lillian 's not out to get you
You do n't mean that
I 'm sorry
About you and Jill and needing a third person She went back to Lillian
I 'm sorry about what I said
You okay
You okay
Do n't worry I can protect my virtue I mean c'mon Wade give me a break
Okay She 's fine
For a while
Makes me sad it was her Instead of me I shoulda froze
It makes me sad
When did she die
Maybe Wade should take a look at it Your pipes 'll freeze Wade would you do that
You 're not using it today
Have you been heating the house Not just with the stove
Yes Here 's your ticket
Do n't give me a hard time Mr Gordon I 'm just
Do n't ever put your hands on me Mr Gordon
Yesterday morning you passed a stopped school bus which was flashing its lights then you
I 'm issuing you a ticket Moving violation
Jesus Christ Mr Gordon when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons I do n't call ahead for an appointment
How 's that
GORDON Ca n't it wait then
GORDON Something about my father
GORDON Mrs Gordon Thank you
GORDON He 's asleep We were up very late
GORDON Who are you
He got his deer yet
His office You mean my old office
It 's called a grilled cheese sandwich you dub
No I I 've been out on the grader all morning Twombley 's summer people Massachusetts Friend of Gordon 's It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting I got ta go
Where how 'd you hear that
Jack
Not since last night He took a guy hunting
Marg You got orders
Marg
This town sucks
Fuck Wade Whitehouse It 's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering Whatever somebody does to improve things around here you got ta find fault with it
What
You be careful of that little bastard He 's dying to get in your pants you know
I do n't know you My goddamn father and I do n't know you
Crawl
You and me
Yeah
Call it what you want
Love What the fuck do you know about love
You do n't know me You do n't know me So fuck you Fuck you
You think you can take me now Come on try
Come on smart guy Tell how it 's no big deal Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman 's head
Wade I thought she was alright Till this morning she was
In the living room
I checked on her She had the electric heater Cold do n't bother her as much as me Which is why I give her the heater
She 's coming
Yeah
How you and Ma doing Have n't seen you in town for a while
You remember Margie Fogg
Jesus Pop how can you stand the cold dressed like that Where 's Ma
Nothing
Atta-go
A lesson in work and its rewards You 'll thank me for this one day Sally turn off that TV
Take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things Call Chub Merritt get your car back call a dentist for God 's sake and get your tooth pulled do n't trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police Let them work on this
For what
But you got ta hear this You wo n't believe it Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I 'm in his office
Then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you do n't know who the hell it belongs to Strange It 's the business with the old man I know and how incredibly pissed I was at him and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that and the Goddamned truck going through the ice not to mention Margie 's being so upset one thing on top of another
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop I was a careful child and I became a careful adult but at least I was n't afflicted by that man 's violence
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
It was n't me I was n't there but I heard about it When I heard about it it was about Elbourne
It may have happened but not the way you said
I hate to disappoint you but I do n't think it happened
I was thinking about that story you told me about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after
Right 's right goddamnit Do n't you care what 's right
It 's too neat Things ai n't that neat It makes me mad That somebody can pay to kill somebody his own father-in-law and not be punished for it Do n't that piss you off
A hunting accident is perfect
Here 's my theory Twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out Finds out his son-in-law is involved
Okay It 's likely there are people in the union who do n't want Twombley to testify They probably include his son-in-law who 's vice-president and will probably be the next president I read that in the papers What 's his name Mel Gordon
They would n't deal with a guy like Jack Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead
Money
Well your friend I think Jack Hewitt
That it was n't an accident
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one
Want to know what I think happened
Anything new about the shooting Twombley
Yeah She 'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop We ca n't leave him alone here he 'll set the damn place on fire With Jill here a lot it 'll be good to have Margie around Things are going to change in that department by the way I got a custody lawyer in Concord I 'm gon na see him tomorrow All hell 's gon na break loose but it 's worth it
What about her
Yeah I forgot
Anyone else want one Rolfe
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do I guess
Have n't you already done a bit of that
Get some sleep
Do n't think about it You 're exhausted
What happened
Who
How was she
Huh
They were out deer hunting right Jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body
You think Jack shot him
Twombley
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business
No not tonight I 'm in bed too I 'm calling because I need you to listen You 're supposed to be a smart guy You 're a professor I got this theory Jack says he did n't see Twombley shot but he did
Yeah I know him the kid that was with him Maybe you do too Jack Hewitt He works for LaRiviere with me He 's my best friend
Yeah brother look I was calling cause has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley Evan Twombley
Rolfe
Daddy Daddy please
Yes dear
Big secret You said the same thing to Newsweek
That 's not really the point
I know But lotsa times I feel like it 's me versus the world Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh I mean it does n't take a genius to figure which is more important
When I write my memoirs I think I 'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One
I 'm sorry honey
I know Mom It was great really
Back at The Fishbowl
Mom just this once give it a rest
Hey Joey how bout a cocoa double whip cream
I 'm sure he 's busy

He did n't leave us
Fuck off you stupid asshole
The woman you shot She was my friend
Smart for your age eh Top of your class Tell me do you know what the word quot propaganda quot means

There they are
Oh NY god oh my god oh my god
How you doing sweetie
Daddy
Alice
It was the experience of a lifetime
Hey you guys back already
Warn then again If they do n't respond shoot them down We will not be intimidated
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner
It 's some kind of trick a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement
Did we warn them off
MECHANIC cross it The static overwhelms the voice then cuts out
MECHANIC Okay you 're aerated To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump There 's no switch in Avionics so you 'll have to cross the wires There should be five wires just to your left Do you see them
MECHANIC Pop it open There should be a red switch toggle it up
MECHANIC Do you see the maintenance panel
Sluggish I think it 's jammed too
CARLTON Lem me take a look
CARLTON Just stay on my wing sir I 'll take you all the way in
CARLTON We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way
CARLTON Stay cool
CARLTON Okay We 're gon na arc a fat one to the right Got it

NORTHWOOD To swear you in as President
CHANDLER If fired upon tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage
CHANDLER If challenged our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission
CHANDLER They still have the President it 's past their deadline and they have n't called What do you think it means
NORTHWOOD I hate to be pragmatic but they 'll sacrifice pawns before kings It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff
NORTHWOOD We 've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace
CHANDLER Does your office have anything to add Mr Dean
My loyalty was never to my country

I 'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office
Maria Maria Mitchell
Thank you
Conference rooms though some have other functions The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center
I guess it depends on your perspective
You do n't know the half of it Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center The MCC as we call it can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth We 're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to
Ms Mitchell So nice to finally meet you in person
You got what you wanted You going to release us now
Jim
Please You can kill me but leave my daughter alone
You will be the first to pay for that mistake
Say something dear
Shall I begin by executing the President 's daughter She 's right here
That was war
How can you I mean they 're people
Why Do you enjoy it
Do you have to be so brutal
My husband is a very courageous man
What do you know of my husband
Leave my daughter alone
Now or he dies please

I wish it were that easy
I miss you And I miss her

How do you know she understands You have n't spent more than five minutes with her or me in weeks
For godsakes Jim slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy Not even you can plug all the world 's leaks Do n't you think it 's a sign you 're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person

You 've made your point Commissioner There 's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that 's Clarence Oveur He 's got a lunar flight today I want him pulled Jacobs pull Oveur
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one
That 's right Commissioner Senselessly murdered just minutes ago
What
You handle your front office people I 'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board
And what do the boys on the board know about safety Commissioner Let u me u talk to them

Are you afraid
What will happen to him Ted
You mean
Simon just ejected
I just want you to know I love you Ted and always will
That was very well put Ted
I mean until we start to burn up
Ted we 've only got ten minutes
Elaine I 'm going back there Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can
Elaine what 's going on
Elaine
There 's something dangerously wrong with this ship Elaine I know its the wiring That toilet 's just the tip of the iceberg
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face
What word would you use Elaine
Then you u do u think I 'm insane
Elaine I mean the mission has to be aborted This ship should never have passed FSA inspection This thing is held together by string and chewing gum
Elaine we have to go back
Elaine
Not now Elaine
I 've got it Elaine I 've figured out what 's wrong with the shuttle
Let me by Elaine
I have to get in there I have to stop this flight
Goodbye Ted I do n't want to hurt you
If that 's the way you want it
Ted you must remember what the doctor said the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you 're sick Now take your electro-shock and you 'll be back at the space center in no time And by the way Ted I 'm leaving you for Simon
And when are you going to realize Ted that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now
Sammy Davis Junior Terrible car accident He has n't been the same since

That 's not important now Elaine We have to talk
Elaine
Is he making any progress Doctor

The human brain is a highly complex organ Elaine perhaps the most complex next to the bladder Let me show you Ted 's problem is in this area This area this area here here here under here here
Simon what are you saying
Simon I did n't want it to end like this We can be friends You 'll die out there
My career is shot
Ca n't we change course
Simon what 's happening
Simon I 'm going to check ROK 's secondary readout unit
I think so
Do n't be too long
So mentally ill
Elaine Ted 's a danger to himself he 's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East
I guess this is a first for you
Frank 's the best pilot in the program
But darling they 've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe
And I can hardly believe that I 'm engaged to someone like you Simon I 'm a very lucky woman
Simon
Roger You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit
I 'd rather sit down for this one Elaine
Roger
I see What do you think our alternatives are
Yes sir
There 's nothing wrong with me Elaine What about tonight just you and me We can be alone I can get rid of everyone else on the ship I 've already proven u that u
Life support check Elaine it 's obvious you 've been ignoring me You 're a woman I can relate to that
Systems check positive Look Elaine I
You have great tits
Can I say something of a personal nature to you
Elaine I 'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago
That 's not possible
That does n't make sense Repeat analysis
Intermitant failure in scan mode R Analyze
No more kids yelling 'Your old man 's a thieving rapist
It 's going to be terrific A whole new world new kids to play with
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury
We 'll have to check Jimmy It 's a pretty long trip to Mercury
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back Jimmy
He 's a boy dog
Can I hold him
Come on up Jimmy Say that 's some puppy What 's his name
All right Here
I do n't want to hear that word
We 've spent everything on these operations Is it really worth it We 've pawned your mother 's wedding ring The kids have no winter clothes
I 'm sure
That 's right Joe Now no one 's going to hurt you and no one has to know what 's wrong with you
Joe the insurance policy wo n't help your wife and kids You bought auto insurance not life insurance
Joe you do n't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people
Captain the coffee machine is jammed and I do n't like it
All right Captain Oveur Over
Just poached on toast Over
No Poached Over
A couple eggs and juice would be nice Mary Over
What should I say
A b
Sixteen C why
Yes sir commander This is Mercury One Everything seems A okay up here and ready for count-down
Captain Oveur your navigator Mr Unger and your first officer Mr Dunn
Do you think it 's necessary to explain u everything u
We do n't have much time Let 's move I 'll explain everything
Captain Oveur
Ah yes the Institute I 'm familiar with it
It 's a privilege to meet you sir I 'm familiar with all your work
Say is n't that Dr Barrington the world renowned agronomist
You folks need any help
Do n't try to stop me
Death death How about the first Thursday in March ten o'clock
You 'll have to be more specific than that sir
Do you have an appointment sir
Pull yourself together We 've got to
Then Elaine was right
Kurtz you 're drunk Who 's in command of this ship
I know you 've been subtly spreading the word that I 'm having a breakdown
Look at this wiring It 's shorting out under high temperatures
That 's right Striker And we 're getting married when we return
Well we laughed We laughed all the time
I just wish it was that simple We really were in love You know how it is when you laugh all the time
Sure But that 's only when the love itself goes unchanged
People change in relation to each other Love changes on its own
We were in love but I 'm not sure I know what love is anymore
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
No I mean your head Sit down I 'll take a look at it I 'm a nurse
You 've been hurt
I 'm familiar with your work Doctor You 'll have to excuse me I have to go
Not Dr Barrington the world renowned agronomist
Uh oh thank you It 's nothing
That 's a very nice compliment and I 'd like to say that you 've done the same for me
No I 'm all alone
That 's a lovely name Mine 's Milton Milt Ettenhenim But my friends call me 'Bubbles
You know here we are having coffee together and discussing education and business and economy and we do n't even know each other 's names full names I mean
I know the answer Career A smart woman like you became so involved in your work you did n't have time for marriage
But I think it 's time we stopped talking about me A woman like you why have n't you ever married
After my wife died I felt like a fifth wheel You know so many years being with one person a very wonderful person makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair When Ethel passed away I was lost I could n't function socially and I could n't function in business
Well it really was n't a vacation You see I 'm a teacher in the New York City school system and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education Are you from L.A
No thank you I take it black Like my men
Ah wo n't you sit down
I happened to be passing and I thought you might like some corfee
but after awhile you begin to get used to it
Yeah something like that but as I say they did n't have time to tell me very much
Well to tell the truth they really did n't fill me in on many of the details Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer
KRAMER Oh yes Come in Paul Rex will be right out
Excuse me Doc I 've got a plane to land
George Zipp said that
Surely there must be something you can do
Yes everything they 've got How are the passengers doing
Chicago the passengers are beginning to panic When do we start down
Let 's see Those are the flaps that 's the thrust this must turn on the landing lights
Well I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force but this plane has four engines It 's an entirely different kind of flying u all u u together u
Surely you ca n't be serious
Both pilots
What is it Doctor What 's happening
RUMACK You ca n't take a guess for another two hours
RUMACK Ca n't you take a guess
RUMACK Captain how soon can we land
No No one that I know of
RUMACK All right Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly I ca n't even be sure of saving their lives Now is there anyone else on board who can land this plane
RUMACK Elaine you 're a member of this crew Can you face some unpleasant facts
Just how serious is it doctor
RUMACK Let 's see now The co-pilot had fish What did the navigator eat
He had fish
RUMACK Yes yes I remember I had lasagna
RUMACK What was it we had for dinner tonight
RUMACK It 's a big building with patients But that 's not important right now Tell the Captain I must speak to him
RUMACK You 'd better tell the Captain We 've got to land as soon as we can This woman has to be gotten to a hospital
We have some passengers who are very sick Could you come and take a look at them
Sir Excuse me sir I 'm sorry to have to wake you Are you a doctor
See them Elaine
Tell them the gear is down and we 're ready to land
Yes
I do n't care I just do n't have what it takes They 'd be better off with someone who 'd never flown before
Oil pressure I forgot to check the oil pressure When Kramer hears about this the shit 's gon na hit the fan
Rats I 've lost number three
It 's a damn good thing he does n't know how much I hate his guts
Sluggish Like a wet sponge
And a little ice
That 's what I 've been trying to tell these people
A lot of people made plans before the war Like George Zipp
I think they 're getting the hang of it When we re-enlist I 'll teach them baseball
What 's his problem
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp
Is it Because of my mistake six men did n't return from that raid
Headquarters What is it
But it wo n't be Not as long as you insist on living in the past
Mostly I remember the nights when we were together I remember how you used to hold me and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle and then afterwards how we 'd watch until the sun came up When it did it was almost like like each new day was created only for us
Elaine just hear me out I know things have n't been right for a long time But it will be different like it was in the beginning Remember
I love you Elaine
My orders came through My squadron ships out tomorrow I 'll be leading a very important mission
You you should n't have come I do n't have time now
Ted what are you doing here
But if you 'll just give me
You expect me to believe that
You know I have n't been able to get near an airplane since the war And even if I could they would n't hire me because of my war record
Elaine not yet I promise you I really can change
Look you 'll be back in town tomorrow night We 'll have dinner talk it over
Do n't you feel anything for me at all any more
I know things have n't been right for a long time but it 'll be different If you 'll just be patient I can work things out
I came home early and found your note I guess you meant for me to read it later Elaine I 've got to talk to you
Elaine
I think so but I 've never seen it so acute
Who wants to be first
Joey can stay up here for a while if he 'd like to
Hello
Good-bye darling
Good-bye darling
So long darling Good-bye Take care of yourself
Good-bye darling
You promise you 'll write
All right he 's on final now Put out all runway lights except niner
Watch your altitude Striker It 's too erratic You ca n't come straight in You 've got enough fuel left for two hours flying You 've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather
You are now eight miles from the airport Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet
Runway niner It 's the longest and directly into the wind
Yes Captain
Here
How ya doing honey
Oh I ca n't stand it
What did you think of 'Great Expectations
Jack is n't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck Maybe he 's on our flight to Chicago
and that you do n't really try except during the playoffs
and that lots of times you do n't even run down court
I think you 're the greatest But my Dad says you do n't work hard enough on defense
I think you should go back to your seat now Joey Right Clarence
I 'm sorry son but you must have me confused with someone else My name is Roger Murdock I 'm the co-pilot
Okay this is one of my favorites
I thought maybe you 'd like to hear a song
I 'm Randy
Oh it 's nothing to be alarmed about We 'll get back to you very quickly
Well the doctor will be with you in just a moment One thing do you know what he had for dinner
Yes
Would either of you like another cup of coffee
No he 's not bothering anyone Let him stay up here
Do you want me to check the weather Clarence
We have clearance Clarence
Roger
Roger
Sorry Clarence Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln
Could I borrow your guitar I thought I might be able to cheer her up
There 's a little girl on board who 's ill and
Excuse me Sister
Mr Striker the passengers are ready
Well I flew in the war but that was a long time ago I would n't know anything about it
The cockpit What is it
No No thank you
Oh I have n't flown for a long time
Thank you
Yeah
Your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes
I think you 're just a little scared now about what you might find once the lights go out A little scared and a lot curious Maybe more than you want to admit But does n't that turn you on that curiosity and fear swirling together Think of it as broadening your horizons
A virgin I find that very arousing
I know Why do n't you hang around for a while let me entertain you It 's Matt right Now tell me the truth have you ever made it with one of us
The girl out front mentioned Strader 's assistant somebody named Watson Maybe he knows
You 've got me all wrong I do n't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable
Oooh Hardball That sounds interesting Are you going to strike me You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me I 've got my own ropes
In there
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is
Ss'ai k'ss Perfect
That 's right
I may be an asshole but at least I 'm a real detective not some outer shit space thing
Well if it is n't Detective Jetson Forget you hip waders big guy
Look at your dildo partner He 's too scared to even come down to the sand You 're not gon na get wet standing here moron
You do n't have squat
So what 've you got on Tuggle 's killers
Move a finger Harcourt and you 're history
You were partners with him on some Slag uh Newcomer real estate thing
Sergeant Detective I was n't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet
Yes
Do it
Kill them both
When we picked him up he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about Hubley
He did n't recognize me
That cop the human he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver
How do I look
But there 's no more drug
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up
I never thought I 'd say this but for once in my life I think I 'm willing to wait for back-up
No he 's not Not if he overdosed on the drug Massive amounts trigger a a change Your body functions seize up you appear to be dead but it 's really a state of incubation When you emerge you 're
It 's Harcourt
Do what George
There Go back Down that side street
It 'd be for your own good I think you 'd be better off with a partner who 's a little more by the book Still I got ta tell you George for a quiet guy you 're sure hell on wheels once you get going I 'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective
Ss-ai
Fuck procedure
Why What 's the big goddamn deal
George c'mon lighten up It 's a beauty of a case Do n't sweat it we got him by the short hairs He ai n't gon na make any more of the shit
George uh you 're gon na break his little chest bones
Uh George
If the drug is here we must destroy it
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
I must trust you Matthew I can not stop this without you
Your people do n't know about this part of out past And they ca n't know It would threaten our entire existence here
No I am sure not That is why I am so concerned someone must now be producing it here But none of my people know how to make it The process was carefully guarded
We all did
Like your cocaine I suppose The high lasts several hours We would receive small amounts of it as a reward for our labor
It is called ss'jabroka To us it is a potent narcotic
No I can not involve you This is not your concern
You must leave me alone on this
and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart So what the hell 's the connection
So we 've got three guys dead All Newcomers all killed the same way execution style
What was that about
It 's all right George It 's cool Just wait here all right I 'll be back in a coupla minutes
Come on you wo n't have to get near the water
Why
Come on let 's go dude Surf 's up
Well let 's roll George
George she 's not gon na divorce you You mate for life remember
A man a human was wiring it to your car I did n't get a good look at him I must call my wife
Yeah go home Get some sleep You do sleep do n't you
Do n't count on me George I never had any ideals
You humans are very curious to us You invite us to live among you in an atmosphere of equality we 've never known before You lay before us a beautiful green world full of freedoms and opportunities You give us ownership of our lives for the first time and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves to live by the rules rules that are n't made to keep one people subordinate to another but rules that exist to preserve equality You aspire to very high ideals here
There is so much our two peoples do n't understand about each other
Your health
In the other man 's rectum
Maybe not I do n't know I 'm not sure I 'm gon na go She does n't need her burn-out of a father there
I appreciate your honesty George
It 's like having an eleventh finger removed It hurts like hell but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place
Was Divorced
Yeah I know the routine
So she keeps you on a pretty short leash does she
I believe he is probably lying
We were chasing you because you ran you dumb son-of-a-bitch
Who is he
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na
Ss'loka It means literally small but intelligent creature It loses much in the translation
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked
This is mole It 's good
Three months We learn quickly We adapt It is our strength what we were bred for to adapt to hostile environments
Yeah sure I knew that
In the camps we were lodged four to a room The selection process was entirely random We did not get to stay with our friends or families

We 'd like to ask you about a business associate of your Warren Hubley
He has not been home since that day But she told me where to find him

Mrs Porter is not taking her husband 's death well
I believe I should interview the widow alone
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us My spouse 's brother is one

Position
Rescue mission There 's some juicy colonists daughters we got ta rescue from virginity
Let 's go let 's go Cycle through
Would you Sir
This floor 's freezing
Uh Apone I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC over
Flame-units only I want rifles slung
First squad up on line Hicks get yours in a cordon Watch the rear
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast Immediate dust off on my 'clear then stay on station
Okay let 's do it
that 's better Pan it around a bit
You did okay Bishop
She 's alive They brought her here and you know it
WE 'RE NOT LEAVING
HOW MUCH TIME
It 's going to be closer You better get going
I 'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway Believe me I 'd prefer not to I may be synthetic but I 'm not stupid
I 'll go
And it 's too late to shut it down
How long until it blows
Hard to say It may have been blind instinct attraction to the heat of whatever but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we could n't destroy her without destroying ourselves That 's if she exists of course
Well the queen is always physically larger then the others A termite queen 's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it ca n't move at all It is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors She is the center of their lives quite literally the mother of their society
That is the question of the hour We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization An ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
Yes That follows
Now let me get this straight The aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those
Sorry to disappoint you
Look maybe the thing did n't even exist right And if I 'd made it a major security situation the Administration would 've stepped in Then no exclusive rights nothing
You sent them to that ship I just checked the colony log directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine Signed Burke Carter J
But they will know about it Burke From me Just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine Section 22350 of the Commerce Code
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command Right
What rank I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here
You son of a bitch
This is clearly an important species we 're dealing with here We ca n't just arbitrarily exterminate them
Well I mean I know this is an emotional moment but let 's not make snap judgments Let 's move cautiously First this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
Now hold on a second I 'm not authorizing that action
She 's right
Yeah Maybe the organisms like the heat that 's why they built
Uh-hunh One of thirty or so all over the planet They 're completely automated We manufacture them by the way
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you
Well it did n't occur to me It 's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board
That 's the plan My word on it
Yello Oh Ripley Hi
Yes and I 've read it You wake up every night sheets soaking the same nightmare over and over
If you go It 's a second chance kiddo And it 'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it You got ta get back on the horse
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract
Running loaders forklifts that sort of thing
I heard you were working in the cargo docks
Well the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration against mineral rights We 're getting into a lot of terraforming 'Building Better Worlds
I was reamed steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys and now you want me to go back out there Forget it
No There 's no way
They had their minds made up before I even went in there They think I 'm a head case
Just tell them what happened The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional
Look I believe you but there are going to be some heavyweights in there You got Feds you got interstellar commerce commission you got colonial administration insurance company guys
Cancer Hmmmm They still have n't licked that one Cremated Interred Parkside Repository Little Chute Wisconsin No children
Amanda Ripley-McClaren Married name I guess Age sixty-six at time of death Two years ago I 'm sorry
Well I was going to wait until after the inquest
You 'd drifted right through the core systems It 's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they are you all right
Shit Apone collect magazines from everybody We ca n't have any firing in there
PDT 'S Personal-Data Transmitters Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted
It 's insured
Dead on all channels
We 're trained to deal with these kinds of situations
You would n't be going in with the troops I can guarantee your safety
Forget it
How do you feel
I told them to fall back
GET THEM OUT OF THERE DO IT NOW
So then the fusion containment shuts down
Proceed inside
What is it
Where are your parents You have to try
One of us
Hold at forty Slow circle of the complex
How may drops is this for you Lieutenant
We 're not making that out too well What is it
Alive
Okay stand by in operations Let 's go
He 's coming in I feel safer already
All right the area 's secured Let 's go in and see what their computer can tell us First team head for operations Hudson see if you can get their CPU on line Hicks meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower
Are there any questions Hudson
Is this going to be a stand-up fight Sir on another bug-hunt
Hudson Sir He 's Hicks
Sir
Fuckin A
Six meters Five What the fu
Let 's get these things lit
Do it
I want you two walking the perimeter I know we 're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert We 've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand
I do n't fucking believe this Do you believe this
Aye-firmative
Are you finished You okay
Not that tunnel the other one
Sure Hicks
Do n't be long Ellen
We ai n't going anywhere
All right She 's alive I believe it But we got ta get moving Now
Stand back
We did n't miss anything
Get back here both of you Fall back to Operations
Let 's waste him No offense
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked
Yeah I 've noticed
Well that 's the grenade launcher you probably do n't want to mess with that
If it comes to that I 'll do us both Let 's see that it does n't Here I 'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine
Maybe Maybe not
But they do n't know that They 're probably looking for other ways to get in That 'll take them awhile
Ca n't tell Lots D gun 's down to twenty Ten It 's out
On my way
That 's right So we put up welded barricades at these intersections and seal these ducts here and here Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units here
All right There 's a fire door at this end The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door
How long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue
Removed surgically before embryo implantation Subject Marachuk John L Died during procedure They killed him getting it off
You 're just reading me
Hudson give us a break
Maybe you have n't been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked pal
Look man let 's just bug out and call it even okay
Anytime Anywhere
Somebody said alien she thought they said illegal alien and signed up
Hey Vasquez you ever been mistaken for a man
Ca n't be That 's inside the room
They 're right on us Vasquez how you doing
I do n't know an acid hole in a duct Something under the floors not on the plans I do n't know
Seal the door
Just get back here
What do you mean they cut the power How could they cut the power man They 're animals
Oh right Right With those things running around No way
What about the colony transmitter That up-link tower down at the other end Why ca n't we use that
I do n't care how Think of a way Think of something
We need the other drop-ship The on one the Sulaco We have to bring it down on remote somehow
Thanks
This service tunnel is how they 're moving back and forth
Man we 're not going to make it seventeen hours Those things are going to come in here just like they did before man they 're going to come in here and get us man long before
You ca n't help them Right now they 're being cocooned just like the others
Looks like it stung him
Sounds like you Hicks
So what do I tell this guy
There 's a guy on the horn mom-and-pop survey team Says he 's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau out past the Ilium range a couple days ago
Bad dreams again Do you want something to help you sleep
How long have I been on Gateway station
Terrible
Yes honey I think we both can
That 's right
Right here baby Right here
Newt I want you to hang on now Hang on tight
Newt wait
Sure Go left
Come on Crawl faster
Burke Open the door
Mommy I mean Ripley I 'm scared
Wah Where are
I 'll be right in the other room Newt And look I can see you on that camera right up there
You mean dead
Where is she
Did you ever have a baby
Is n't that how babies come I mean people babies they grow inside you
Did one of those things grow inside her
Why do they tell little kids that
My mommy always said there were no monsters No real ones But there are
Ripley she does n't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic
Now you just lie here and have a nap You 're exhausted
I 'm sorry Newt
You 're really something ace
The 'maze You mean the air ducts
And hope to die
You promise
They 're dead
Because you 'll be gone soon like the others Like everybody You 'll be dead and you 'll leave me alone
I do n't want you for a friend
Casey She 's my only friend
What did you say
LEUWEN Sixty maybe seventy families
What are you talking about What people
Why wo n't you check out LV-426
LEUWEN Thank you Officer Ripley That will be
That 's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock Like I said
LEUWEN It did not however contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up
At present the girls only peck me Their cruelty surely will wreck me But one little beak in my own And I 'll up to heaven be flown At present the girls only peck me But one little beak in my own And I 'll up to heaven be flown Up to heaven be flown Up to heaven be flown
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely But if she wo n't fly to my aid Then into a ghost I must fade I need to net one birdie only But if she wo n't fly to my aid Then into a ghost I must fade To a ghost I must fade To a ghost I must fade
Then that would be eating and drinking I 'd live like a Prince without thinking The wisdom of old would be mine A woman 's much better than wine Then that would be eating and drinking The wisdom of old would be mine A woman 's much better than wine She 's much better than wine She 's much better than wine
What do you mean
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it
Well I think that went off remarkably well do n't you
Follow me please The Archbishop would like a word
Extremely clever
You were sublime
Nothing He can marry who he pleases I do n't give a damn
The marriage
Did you know Had you heard
Looks and talent do n't always go together Katherina
You might be disappointed
Perhaps
My dear it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk
A Turkish brothel
A brothel
In a harem
Well do you know where it 's set my dear
Well even if there is I do n't think you want to get involved with this one
No
Yes
Oh News travels fast in Vienna
Really What else did he tell you today Give me some gossip
Good morning
Excuse us Fraulein Good night Signore
I assume she 's the virtuoso in that department There ca n't be any other reason you 'd marry someone like that
Is she a good fuck
No she 's fine
Oh excuse me
Do n't bother
Do n't bother
Oh Your Grace I thank Your Grace I thank you
Oh sir he 's never disobeyed me in anything Please Your Grace give him one more chance
Yes sir that 's the truth But do n't blame him The fault is mine I was too indulgent with him But not again Never again I promise I implore you let me bring him back here I 'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully
Sir
Oh sir yes He 's about to make the worst mistake of his life Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage I know my son He is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him
But he needs to be here in Salzburg Your Grace He needs me and he needs you Your protection your understanding
Then try harder Mozart I have no intention of dismissing you You will remain in my service and learn your place Go now
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg Your father is waiting for you there patiently I will speak to you further when I come
How much provocation am I to endure from you The more license I allow you the more you take
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants
Oh shut up I 'm sick to death of that tune
Are you drunk You invited me And my horse Here he is Ottavio
I 've come to dinnnnnner
Don Giovannnnnnnni
I feel wrong I feel wrong being here
Yes
I want to go back to Vienna
I want to go
Please Let me sit here Let me stay here with you I promise I wo n't say all word I 'll just be here so you know no one 's going to hurt you Please please
It 's killing me
I ca n't write it
Give me two more weeks Please
This is my wife Stanzi I 've been sick but I 'm all right now Are n't I
No Do n't answer it
Why not
What 's that Oh Who gave you this How much is it Wolfi who gave you this
No one
Shut up I 'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money
Half the house You 'll never see a penny I want it here in my hand
I do n't trust this man And I did n't like what he did with your opera It was common
When We need money now Either he pays now or you do n't do it
You 're not going to do this
Half the receipts Stanzi
What
Salzburg We were just talking about Salzburg If you 've come from my friend the Fartsbishop you 've arrived at just the right moment Because I 've got good news for him I 'm done with Vienna It 's over finished done with Done with Done with
Yes my love
We 'll have a little party Come in Come in You know Herr Schikaneder This is a very nice girl
Stanzi
Oh damn
Well ask her
What does she want
Wolfi I think your father 's tired I 'll cook us something here
Wolfi
May I offer you some tea Herr Mozart
Stop it Wolfi I look dreadful Welcome to our house Herr Mozart
I love you I love you
No
Tell them to go
Tell them to go away I do n't want to see anybody
This is n't pride It 's sheer stupidity
All they want to see is your work What 's wrong with that
How are we going to live Wolfi Do you want me to go into the streets and beg
Yes
Well I 'm not borrowing any more money from my mother and that 's that
No they will not I know how things work in this city
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking We 'd be set up for life
I think you 're mad You 're really mad
Excuse me Wolfi Mama is not feeling very well Can we leave now
Yes
Tish-I'm-tee
Tish-I 'm tee What 's that
Ui-vol-i-tub
Just say it you 'll see It 's very serious Em iram Em iram
No this is serious Say it backwards
Em iram Em iram
No no Say it backwards shit-wit Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards
Sra-I'm-sick Sra-I 'm sick
Yes I think it 's brilliant You 've been doing it for years
Why People fart backwards
Because here everything goes backwards People walk backwards dance backwards sing backwards and talk backwards
Go ahead tell him Tell them all They wo n't understand you anyway
Fartsbishop
Where
No No No
Stop it
I regret we have no servants to show you out Herr Salieri Respect my wish and go
No I was assisting him He asked me
And I 'm asking you
No he does n't And I do n't want you here Just go please
Well thank you very much You can go now
Why you
What are you doing here
What
Then do n't It 's up to you Not to be vague that is the price
It 's a post all Vienna seeks If you want it for your husband come tonight
What do you mean
What for
Tonight
Oh thank you sir
Oh yes He 's really proud of his work
Yes sir He does n't make copies
Yes
That 's very tempting but it 's impossible I 'm afraid Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing You see they 're all originals
Do n't keep calling me that It puts me at such a distance I was not born a Court Composer you know I 'm from a small town just like your husband
Sir we really need this job We 're desperate My husband spends far more than he can ever earn I do n't mean he 's lazy he 's not at all he works all day long It 's just he 's not practical Money simply slips through his fingers it 's really ridiculous Your Excellency I know you help musicians You 're famous for it Give him just this one post We 'd be forever indebted
No sir This is my own idea
My husband is a proud man sir He would be furious if he knew I 'd come
I I really can not do that Your Excellency You see he does n't know I 'm here
Would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now While I wait
I understand
How charming But why did he not come himself
Frau Mozart
Excellency
You 're mad She 's mad Wolfi
Oh yes And what 's so intelligent about writing a Requiem
I 'm paying people just to wait for you It 's ridiculous
I 'm paying these people Do you realize that
Look you little clown do you know how many people I 've hired for you Do you know how many people are waiting
He 's not in But he 's working on it He said to tell you
Not at all
Ah Well Ah I see you 've got your manager with you Well Madame how about half the receipts
Do you hear him Do you
Oh now I 'm a bad housekeeper
And so you do The only time you come out is to eat
But you ca n't take her without reference It 's unheard of
In three months Papa
Oh yes
LADY Behold
LADY Hey
LADY Behold
LADY Adorable
LADY Be careful
WEBER Young man I am no stranger to theatres I 'm no stranger to insolence
WEBER Call Herr Mozart You call Herr Mozart immediately This is insupportable
WEBER Do you know who I am This is my daughter I am Frau Weber We are favoured guests
WEBER Let us pass please Let us pass at once We 're with the Emperor
SCHLUMBERG What a strange young man
I said play
People who know say the girl 's got talent You must judge for yourself If you think she stinks say so
Gertrude
SCHLUMBERG You ca n't be Herr Mozart
SCHLUMBERG Upstairs
SCHLUMBERG I was But she quite outgrew the little I could show her
SCHLUMBERG Just one year
I 'd like a little wine if you have it
SCHLUMBERG Ah now Here she comes
Well look at them
Do you like this Salieri
Yes
Really
Of course not
Oh
Why not
I do n't think you understand me Court Composer
Sire
I 'm sure there is a way Majesty Some kind of a little contest I could perhaps put together a small Committee and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty 's wishes
Yes of course My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart
An interesting idea Majesty But
Oh Your Majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
Good morning Court Composer This is my niece the Princess Elizabeth
Excuse me Sire but what do you think these could be Being a foreigner I would love to learn
Well there it is Now to business Young man we are going to commission an opera from you What do you say
Finally Such an immense joy Diletto straordinario
Ah-ha
Let 's have some fun Bring in Herr Mozart please But slowly slowly I need a minute to practice
Delightful Court Composer Would you permit me to play it as he comes in
May I try it
What a charming idea May I see
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna Majesty It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure if that is your Majesty 's intention
You are passionate Mozart But you do not persuade
Twenty sire How about twenty Twenty minutes of continuous music No recitatives
Guess Guess Majesty Imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
But it 's new it 's entirely new It 's so new people will go mad for it For example I have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling Suddenly the wife 's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation Duet turns into trio Then the husband 's equally screaming valet comes in Trio turns into quartet Then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on On and on sextet septet octet How long do you think I can sustain that
But Majesty this is just a frolic It 's a piece about love
Sire I swear to Your Majesty there 's nothing like that in the story I have taken out everything that could give offense I hate politics
Well Majesty it is only a comedy
Well yes I admit it is
Who told you this Majesty
Yes Sire
Ah By all means
What is it
Thank you Sire
Well my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna
Excuse me but how old are you
Really How delightful May I ask when you marry
Majesty this is Madame Weber She is my landlady
My dear young man do n't take it too hard Your work is ingenious It 's quality work And there are simply too many notes that 's all Cut a few and it will be perfect
I do n't understand There are just as many notes Majesty as are required Neither more nor less
What do you mean Sire
So then you like it You really like it Your Majesty
And German
It is new it is is n't it Sire
What On one hearing only
Ah-ha
Yes where
Well what is it about Tell us the story
Why so
Majesty
And now he has returned the compliment Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you
The Director of our Opera Count Orsini-Rosenberg
No no please It is not a holy relic You know we have met already In this very room Perhaps you wo n't remember it you were only six years old He was giving the most brilliant little concert here As he got off the stool he slipped and fell My sister Antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did Jumped straight into her arms and said Will you marry me yes or no
Ah-ha Well There it is Good
Yes what about him
Well what do you have for me today
STRACK Yes sir
Ah-ha What do you say Chamberlain
STRACK I agree Majesty but I 'm afraid it 's not possible The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop
Hush I 'm talking to His Majesty Your Majesty I wish to express only one thing that you who are the Father of us all could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us 'Honour your Father and Mother that your days may be long upon the earth
She does She says I sleep all day
Do n't worry I 'm not staying here to be a burden
Never mind You wo n't have to do anything for me ever again I 'm leaving
Are you playing a trick on me
Papa is this your idea
I 'm tired of this game Please play without me
Yes Papa name it Name it I 'll do anything you say
No really
Thank you That 'll be fine Do n't spend any money on me
Why did n't you mention it in your letters
It 's too dangerous Papa But they 're going to love it Ah there she is
It 's a secret
Oh let 's not talk about it
This one will
I do n't know It 's not important I mean I do n't want pupils They get in the way I 've got to have time for composition
Yes
Pupils
Who Who says that Now that 's a malicious lie
What do you mean It 's wonderful Really it 's it 's marvelous People love me here
It could n't be better
Oh we could if we wanted to but Stanzi wo n't hear of it She wants to do everything herself
She 's very tired poor creature You know me I 'm a real pig It 's not so easy cleaning up after me
Do you always live like this
Is she not here
Of course welcome Welcome ten thousand times Papa my Papa
Why are you here
I write to you with urgent news I am coming to Vienna Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet You are too gullible to see your own danger As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours do as I bid and await my coming
Please do n't ask me to go back again I 'm frightened I 'm very very frightened
I suppose so He sits there all he time doing some silly opera
I 'm frightened sir Really When he speaks he does n't make any sense You know he said he saw he said he saw his father And his father 's dead
Here in his stomach They bend him right over
I do n't know He has pains
You do n't know what it 's like Herr Mozart frightens me He drinks all day then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse
I 'm leaving I 'm not working there anymore I 'm scared
In there sir
Yes what
Of course not You 're a good girl You 're very kind to do this Next time you 're sure they 'll be out of the house let me know will you
Really What is it he 's writing
Then how does he pay for all this Does he work at all
Do any pupils come to the house
Bene
Bene Bene
Thank you Are you well today Fraulein Lorl
Ah-ha Siena macaroons my favourites Give my best thanks to the baker
Good morning sir
Yes I can live in or out just as you wish
They 'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous
My name is Lorl sir I 'm a maidservant I was asked to come here and offer my services to you
Are you Herr Mozart
So let me see it Where is it
Look I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes
Why not
Can I see it
What The vaudeville what 'd you think
Oh I 'm sorry I 'm sorry What have you got for me Is it finished
What is this
Wolfi
So there you are What do you say
Of course What else do you think they speak here
I 'm serious You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs I 'll guarantee you 'll have a triumph de-luxe Mind you it 'll have to be in German
Animals
I 'd like to try them someday I 'm not sure I 'd be much good at it
I liked the horse
Wonderful He liked the monkey did n't you
Sublime Utterly sublime
Papa the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room
Sssh Stay here
Sssh
Please I 'll give it back I promise Please sir
No doubt sir But I am endowed with talent and you with money If I offer mine you should offer yours
If a man can not earn he must borrow
Well Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead
Really Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
Well I 'm a good teacher The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs please let me know Goodbye Fraulein goodbye Madame goodbye Sir
Well yes on the whole I suppose How long have you been playing Fraulein
Strudel this is Herr Mozart Say good morning

Oh no One hears such sounds and what can one say but Salieri
I never knew that music like that was possible
How could it not Excellency
How could I not
Grazie a lei Signor Antonio
Oh no the honour would be all mine
I know I know Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that
It 's the best opera yet written I know it Why did n't they come
What did you think of it yourself Did you like it at all
But what is it they do n't like
Nine performances Nine That 's all it 's had and withdrawn
With all my heart Mozart
But there are those who have power over him I think I 'll take this up with the Emperor
How fortunate
You burned the score
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg He 's obviously no friend of yours
Really Why
Wolfgang what is it Sta calmo per favore What 's the matter
I ca n't say Really
Two thousand two hundred florins is all I need A hundred Fifty
Ah Italian
Actually it 's a big secret Oh this is delicious What is it
I 'd better not It 's a bit of a secret
Well could you lend me some money till you have one Then I 'll teach her for free That 's a promise Oh I 'm sorry I 'm being silly Papa 's right I should put a padlock on my mouth Seriously is there any chance you could manage a loan Only for six months eight at most After that I 'll be the richest man in Vienna I 'll pay you back double Anything Name your terms I 'm not joking I 'm working on something that 's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe
Do you have a daughter
They 're stupendously successful You ca n't get a seat The only problem is none will hire me They all want to hear me play but they wo n't let me teach their daughters As if I was some kind of fiend I 'm not a fiend
How can anyone say that We have no cook no maid We have no footman Nothing at all
No but I 'm broke I 'm always broke I do n't know why
Look I must have pupils Without pupils I ca n't manage
But I ca n't lose this post I simply ca n't Excellency please Let 's go to the palace and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice He could actually do musical harm to the Princess
Sommer Herr Sommer But the man 's a fool He 's a total mediocrity
Whom did they choose
Filled That 's impossible They have n't even seen my work I need this post Please ca n't you help me Please
Why Here is the music It 's here I am submitting it humbly Is n't that what you wanted
So you see this post is very important to me right now
She is well She is well actually I 'm about to become a father She only told me last night You are the first to know
Your Excellency you requested some specimens of my work Here they are I do n't have to tell you how much I need your help I truly appreciate your looking at these I have pressures on me financial pressures As you know I 'm a married man now
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today Do n't you agree
Did you like it then
But this is absurd
Ah love Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that
A funny little tune but it yielded some good things
Mio caro Adone
I know your work well Signore Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours
Can we see the scene with the music back please
What are you doing Herr Director
But surely the Emperor did n't mean to prohibit dancing when it 's part of the story
Yes but this is not a ballet This is a dance at Figaro 's wedding
Certainly Herr Director
Just let me tell you how it begins
But Your Majesty
Well not especially It can be in Turkish if you really want I do n't care
Exactly
I think you 'd better
Oh Have I seen it
STRACK Herr Mozart
STRACK Look young man the issue is simple If you want this post you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
STRACK Mozart
STRACK Mozart
STRACK Kapellmeister Bonno Count Orsini Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri
STRACK A little modesty would suit you better
STRACK Mozart you are not the only composer in Vienna
STRACK On the contrary
STRACK Because His Majesty wishes it
STRACK What is what
SWIETEN Because they do They go on forever at least what they represent The eternal in us not the ephemeral Opera is here to ennoble us You and me just as much as His Majesty
SWIETEN Mozart music is not the issue here No one doubts your talent It is your judgment of literature that 's in question Even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce Why waste your spirit on such rubbish Surely you can choose more elevated themes
SWIETEN Mozart
SWIETEN Well done Mozart Really quite fine
SWIETEN My dear fellow the language is not finally the point Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre
SWIETEN I do n't think it was really decided Director
Oh my son my poor son
My son why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer Is that your penance Is it
But not his body
No you did n't
Why Why Why Why add to your misery by confessing to murder You did n't kill him
Yes
What
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries I treasure them As you should
My son no one can speak for God
God 's ways are not yours And you are not here to question Him Offer him the salt of penitence He will give you back the bread of eternal life He is all merciful That is all you need to know
You can not say that
SALIERI Every day Sometimes for hours I would pray
SALIERI It was incomprehensible What was God up to Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God 's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married and no rebuke at all Was it possible I was being tested Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful That was very possible All the same why him Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts I could n't stop them
Do you hear me
SALIERI Do you believe it
SALIERI And do they believe it
SALIERI Ah you 've heard that
SALIERI I did n't That was Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart You know who that is
SALIERI Can you recall no melody of mine I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy I wrote forty operas alone What about this little thing
SALIERI Well
I ca n't say I do What is it
Here in Vienna
I know a little I studied it in my youth
My son there is something dreadful on your soul Unburden it to me I 'm here only for you Please talk to me
Offer me your confession I can offer you God 's forgiveness
That makes no difference All men are equal in God 's eyes
I can not leave alone a soul in pain
Do you understand that you have sinned Gravely
In the sight of God that is a sin
You tried to take your life You do remember that do n't you
I am Father Vogler I am a Chaplain here I thought you might like to talk to someone
Yes in the third act
Excuse me did n't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
About the ballet
The Emperor has given him permission
Well Mozart is already rehearsing
Where
Are you absolutely sure
Yes
Exactly
Italian
Yes
STRACK Ah
STRACK Oh yes yes And that was
STRACK I know we banned this play but frankly I ca n't remember why Can you refresh my memory Herr Director
Well actually Sire if you remember we did finally incline to Italian
Bravo Your Majesty
Well I do n't know I mean you 're a delicious delightful delectable little bird but do n't you think you might be just a little tough
What do you mean now
I ca n't wait
Oh Well thank you How wonderful Some people get all the luck
What Who the devil are you
Indeed Just a moment as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him A very appropriate person to do so Yes
No Baron no I 'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna He is constantly drunk He never pays his debts I ca n't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him
I agree Baron
Come with me And stay in the room
What does he want
That lady is back sir
She did n't say But she says it 's urgent
Excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
Oh by the way give him this This is his share That should cheer him up eh
I 'll call tomorrow
And say everything went wonderfully A triumph-de-luxe say that Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times
Well tell him we were here wo n't you
But he 's all right
Can we come in
Herr Salieri
I 'm an orderly not a bleeding psychiatrist I push things about but I 've little say what happens to them
What do you mean 'how did he look
The American Yes duck
HIRSCH I doubt it But it 's something to do
HIRSCH Nurse Hobbs said there 's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog
What shall we do
No a cab will be faster
He 's fine We 'll come right over
Yes Doctor
Yes I should think so
No not really
No why
Yes he is He 's very excited and confused but he 's not crazy if that 's what you mean
He does n't remember He woke up at the zoo
He 's here
What shall we do
Dr Hirsch
Surely you 're not suggesting
HIRSCH You 've absolutely no idea where David might be
And what else
Yes
Dr Hirsch what 's wrong Is this more serious than I know
David says Jack comes to warn him
Yes
Well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
He 's not
HIRSCH It 's a full moon Where is he
HIRSCH Oh dear girl your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me I do n't give a damn who you sleep with I 'm concerned about David
It 's all right Susan Yes Doctor I have
HIRSCH Did he say a wolf
HIRSCH The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them He must have been a very powerful man Although I really do n't see that it is any of your concern Miss Price
HIRSCH That would be Jack Goodman the boy who was killed
HIRSCH What exactly did he call out
HIRSCH Oh Miss Price
HIRSCH Go about your duties
HIRSCH Can I be of service Miss Price
Dr Hirsch Mr Kessler cried out a minute ago
David do n't lose control
David let 's go now
Will you shut up
I swear I do n't know this girl
What
Rational I 'm a fucking werewolf for Christ 's sake
Jack is dead Look six people have been killed I 'm going to the police
I am going to the cops There 's a full moon tonight Jack was right I
Six people mutilated It had to be me Alex
Pull over
I do n't know why I feel so good I have n't felt this good in a long time
I should be committed
I said goodbye to you I was locked out of the flat I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo I guess I am out of my fucking mind
Waking up at the zoo that 's not so insane Having no clothes on That 's insane What did I do last night Alex
Alex I 've lost my mind I woke up at the zoo But you know what I feel terrific
David Where on earth have you been
I 'm off There 's food in the fridge
I 've left those pills for you
Listen if you get too anxious call me at the hospital okay
David do you want me to stay here tonight
It 's silly of you to be apprehensive
Anything
Let me go now you 'll make me late
Tomorrow is the full moon
But David
David you do n't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you Do you really
Of course
Yes
It 's nice to see you
David perhaps you 'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower
The bedroom
Bathroom
Closet
The kitchen
I would think so
What do I think You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends
Your dead friend Jack
You 're to be discharged tomorrow Will you be all right
Are you better now
I 'm a werewolf
Now I 'm embarrassed
Forgive me I 'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it
Not just a patient me
Will you think about it
I 'm serious You do n't know me and I know nothing about you We have a perfect relationship
Will you come with me
I keep having these really terrible dreams They are getting worse and I ca n't seem to stop them
No thank you Just keep me company for a while
I 'm sorry I woke you up
Ahem A Word of Explanation It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about He attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company for he did all the talking We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court by Samuel L Clemens This is after the preface but before chapter one A Word of Explanation You all right
Shall I read to you
Was Jack Goodman your good friend
I know
Twenty-eight
That 's not really a very proper question
It 's okay I want to talk to you
I dream of death mostly
I 've just started it My friend gave it to me
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court by Mark Twain
I thought you were asleep
Will you give me a break
Right
Shall I be forced to feed you David
Shall I be forced to feed you Mr Kessler
Call me Alex
Sorry
Well you 're to take these after you 've eaten Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills
You put me in an awkward position Mr Kessler
I 'm afraid you have to eat something
You have n't eaten your lunch
Mr Kessler
What
I beg your pardon
I thought not
Benjamin have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck
No what
How are we feeling tonight
No
No
No
No
No
Really Susan I do n't think that was very proper and besides it 's common practice now
Why on earth do you say that
Chart says he 's from New York
Yes I should think He called out just now
Yes Mrs Hobbs
Has he been refusing food
Yes Mrs Hobbs
That 's what I want you to do you moron
Who is this girl
Now see here young man
There 's no call for that kind of language
All right you two move along
Officer I killed those people last night
No David Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead The undead
You 've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf 's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted
This is n't Mr Goodman 's idea He is your good friend whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities
You could have told them
That 's very funny that is
PLAYER No You 've had your chance
PLAYER All right laugh then I sha n't tell it
PLAYER You be quiet woman and let me speak
PLAYER Here Gladys Tom Did you hear the one about the crashing plane
Yes but does everyone kill Bambi
Do you have bad dreams too
What are you going to see
Alex
What time is it
I was having a nightmare
HIRSCH Of course not David I 'll fetch in young Miss Price
HIRSCH Believe me The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's And if you 'd read the bloody book you 'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud a fake
HIRSCH David please The police are satisfied I 'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we 'd have seen it on the telly
HIRSCH I really do n't know
HIRSCH No In fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
HIRSCH You 'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
HIRSCH Yes
HIRSCH Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you
HIRSCH You 've never had bad dreams before
HIRSCH In time I 'm sure it will all come back to you
HIRSCH So they said
HIRSCH Now we 've just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now Miss Price will see to your needs Rest now
HIRSCH You 've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while You 'll have some dueling scars to boast of That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow They say a mad man has the strength of ten
HIRSCH You 've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
Get your fucking hands off me What the hell is going on here
HIRSCH Now David I want you to prepare yourself your friend is dead
HIRSCH I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
HIRSCH You 're in a hospital in London
HIRSCH Hello David I am Dr Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours Mr Collins
I could hang myself
Because this must be stopped
Hello
I want you to meet some people
What about the zoo
Thank you
If I was still alive I probably would
You do n't have to say anything
Hi David
I will not accept this Now go away
What Jack That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I 'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people Bullshit
I think I 've lost my mind I think you 're not real I think I 'm asleep and you 're a part of another bad dream
Jack are you really dead
A monster I know I know
Get out of here Jack
I understand all right You 're one of the undead and I 'm a werewolf
Okay you 've seen me Now go away

What
Will you be quiet
What 's wrong with you Shut up
Shut up you zombie
I 'm not listening
If you love me so much Jack you 'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one 's breakfast with the living dead
Warn me Will you get out of here you meat loaf
What
I 'm going completely crazy
Rudy Levine the shmuck
I ca n't stand it
Why should you be surprised You were a very well-liked person
Are n't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace
Hurting your feelings Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me Listen to me I 'm talking to a hamburger
I 'm aware that I do n't look so great but I thought you 'd be glad to see me
Thanks a lot
Nice to see you
You really scared me you shithead

Heathcliffe did n't howl
Pecos Bill
There are n't any coyotes in England

What was it
Did you hear that
Say David
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
What do you think was wrong
I do n't know Now that we 're out here and it 's three degrees I 'm not so sure I would n't rather face a blood-thirsty mob
Come on I 'm freezing
I do n't know Let 's see if there 's an inn or something up the road
Apparently so
What do you mean I 'm starving
You ask them
Wrong
I see You want me to ask these people if they 're burning candles to ward off monsters
You ask them
Maybe the owners are from Texas
What about it
Listen at least it 's warm in here
Nice to see you
Shall we
I assume full responsibility
A severed wolf 's head on a pike as their symbol
Of course The Slaughtered Lamb Why else would they have a severed wolf 's head on a spear as their symbol
Of course The Slaughtered Lamb Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
She says she 'likes me too much
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull
I have to make love to her It 's very simple She has no choice really
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein The love affair that shocked Europe See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican Never has the screen dared
Well anyway do you think she 'll be there
You 're talking about the woman I love
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
Do you think she 'll meet me in Rome
I 'm sorry Northern England first Italy later
Oh I do n't know I mean look around Is n't this a fun place
David
Good
Are you cold
HIRSCH What can we do to assist you
VILLIERS The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved that 's true but I hardly think
VILLIERS Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
HIRSCH Well then what can I do for Scotland Yard
HIRSCH Come in come in Please sit Some tea
HIRSCH Tell him I 'm out No tell him I 've passed away An old war wound or something Tell him I 'm dead And no more calls

VILLIERS I can not accept a connection between David Kessler and last night 's murders We will find him however I can assure you of that
MCMANUS I do n't rightly know sir
MCMANUS Lieutenant the boy seems pretty lucid to me and
MCMANUS He may have a point Lieutenant Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man
MCMANUS Sorry
VILLIERS No thank you
Yes sure
Why not
What 's the idea of turning her down It sounds like a perfectly safe investment
I 'll tell you why I do n't like the crowd you 're mixed up with Personally you can have all the credit you want But for that deal not a cent
I want to know why
What do you suppose anybody wants Money money money
Hello Tom

Mr Dickson in yet
You know Dickson as well as we do He 'll shut the doors before he gives up control
How are you protecting your depositors By making a lot of idiotic loans
What good will that do
Do n't make me laugh Schultz
Personally I think you 're getting panic-stricken about nothing Dickson 's all right
We 've been waiting fifteen minutes
The bank All right Do anything you want with it
I ca n't You just wait and see If that run does n't stop within the next hour I 'll shut the doors You know what that means The bank examiner will step in tomorrow You 'll be forced to liquidate I 'll insist upon it The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar What 's left you gentlemen can have But I 'll guarantee there wo n't be enough to pay your next month 's garage bill
So that 's it eh You 've waited a long time for this chance have n't you Well I 'm not going to resign now or ever
Aw they 've gone crazy You ca n't reason with a mob
I have everything I own in it It 's your bank as well as mine is n't it
I know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city Get that money over here and I 'll stop this run within five minutes
We 'll be forced to shut the doors I 've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive You 've all made money out of it Are you willing to help
What about
Yes You said it Clark That 's the only thing that means anything to me
I 'm running this bank my way Get that clear
Most of the creditors I know personally I 've seen them grow up in the community I knew their fathers and mothers before them
Character hmmpf That 's your idea
What 's the matter with my policy How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years I 'll tell you Not a single one What 's wrong with that kind of banking
I think Mr Dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you do n't mind
He wo n't believe it Mr Dickson But it 's the truth honest it is I was in my apartment last night ask your wife she
I did n't kill him I had nothing to do with that I tell you I was home in my apartment last night I can prove it
I was crazy I tell you Mr Dickson I did n't know what I was doing I wandered around in a daze All I could think of was that they were going to kill me You 'll stand by me wo n't you Mr Dickson You wo n't go back on me now will you I 'll die if they send me to prison
What were you doing at Finlay 's this morning
Do n't be a fool Cluett This is only going to make it worse for you
Stand back Inspector or I 'll shoot Drop that gun
Somebody must be in good humor He was humming Mother Machree
Why of course
Oh
Looks like you 're going to have no trouble at all What was the lady 's name Mr Cluett
That is simple is n't it I assume you can prove that if necessary
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night
I hope you do n't mind me asking you a few questions Mr Cluett
She was n't to blame Mr Dickson It was n't her fault Honest it was n't I begged her to come up She didn't
You just mentioned her name What was she doing there What was she doing in your apartment
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night
Fifty thousand dollars
What happened You 're not a thief How 'd you get mixed up with these kind of people
Confessed Cluett in heaven 's name what got into you
But Dude listen could n't we make this some other time
know but
Dude there 's not any chance of my becoming involved in this is there
What do you mean
Why I could n't do that
Good heavens man You 're not suggesting that I
But after all you ca n't take blood from a stone
I 'm sorry Dude butI
I have n't got it
I know I know Dude Oh I must have been crazy I lost my head completely
What are you doing here
I 'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here
And now fair woman I have you in my power
DICKSON What is that Mr Bones 7
DICKSON You know there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you America 's comfort to misunderstood wives I never thought I would find myself in that class
DICKSON No No I 'm afraid papa is n't that much interested He 's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy old speeches at stuffy old bankers meetings Too busy closing big important deals I think I will have a drink
DICKSON No I know the answer to that one I think you 'd better take me home
DICKSON I knew I could n't trust you You told me you were taking me home
DICKSON What 's this
No No I 'm not I deliberately avoided you I was afraid of making a fool of myself But I wo n't stand it any longer

DICKSON Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women
DICKSON Not bad not bad at all Do you know something I 've always been curious about your line
DICKSON running around Not your work You 'd better start reforming Cyril
DICKSON Here here here now Do n't you go back to work on me too I 'm getting tired of this Besides it 's beginning to affect your looks
Well you can You always could
Being alone with you has always done this to me You know that
Am I Why I I do n't know any reason why I should be unless of course it 's you
Why I needed a
I guess I have said enough I 'm just wasting my breath talking to you
This is my business Mr Dickson 's been like a father to me What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this
No Then maybe you 'll understand Mrs Dickson Oh gee he 's crazy about you Nobody knows it better than you If he ever finds out it 'll kill him

Say come on Show a little enthusiasm What 's the matter Are you sick or something Go on fake it even if it is n't real
What 's the matter You do n't seem very excited about it
It 's all right Thanks
Do n't worry Mr Dickson We 'll find out whether he 's telling the truth I 'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away
No wonder he did n't want to mention her name
He 's just confessed He 's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town
You were right Mr Dickson Brown did n't have anything to do with it Here 's your man
Of course it 's true and he knows it
Maybe But I 'm taking no chances Why this kid 's got a record
All I know is the bank 's been robbed and a murder 's been committed The way I see it Brown here looks guilty
That 's what he says I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now
If he can do it yes
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09
Yes
Why pick on him
What 's the matter What 's going on here This is ridiculous You ca n't hold this boy on a vague suspicion
Yes sir
Mr Dickson Mr Dickson
We ca n't keep open till four o'clock We have n't cash enough to last an hour
What 'll we do
Yes sir But soon as our money runs out they 'll mob the place
Yes sir
Look at them Mr Dickson They 're going crazy
The bank 's reputation would n't be worth a nickel after that This is just a flurry that 's all They 've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken Listen get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash Wait a minute Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot
All right Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away
What are you talking about
Yes sir
He says he ca n't get away in the daytime
I 'm afraid he 's been stalling
Here 's the data on the Clyde deal
Please lady Please be quiet Everything will be all right Open up here folks All right folks please
Quiet down please Take it easy folks Everything will be all right
Absolutely
Yes ma'am you can deposit your money here
DICKSON Oh well I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite When he comes out you tell him I 'll be back He has n't gotten rid of me
DICKSON Well take my word for it and do n't try it It 's useless If it were some other woman I could handle her but after all you ca n't scratch a bank 's eyes out now can you
DICKSON Helen did you ever try competing with a bank
DICKSON Board meeting Oh that means hours I suppose
DICKSON Is that busy husband of mine busy
Matt look There 's Mr Jones
Mr Williams
Yeah I got an idea Come on let 's get to a telephone
Sure they 'd turn him down He ought to know that I 'm going in there and talk to him
They must have turned him down
What 's he doing honey Is he getting any help
Oh Matt
Shh I 'll wait for you upstairs
Now you 've got me worried dear Promise me you wo n't butt in
Oh now do n't be silly
Say Matt you have n't done anything about what you saw today have you
What 's keeping you
In Cluett 's office
Oh Matt you must be mistaken
Well
What 's the matter Matt Gee I thought you 'd be thrilled to death
What happened What did he say Did you get the job
Say I just heard the merger is n't going thru Is n't that grand
All right I 'm lying Do n't forget you called me a liar
Oh you think I 'm lying
A friend of mine yeah really his mother was terribly sick and she was dying would you believe it
Oh ten dollars
With what
Oh is that so
Come here honey
Matt come here
Yes sir
He came to see Mr Cluett
He was in the bank yesterday
Did you say Dude Finlay
Dude Finlay
Never mind all that What did you find out
What did you find out Mike
HALLIGAN Listen here young man nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
HALLIGAN No because me clock struck four and when it strikes four it 's one
HALLIGAN No It was n't earlier because
HALLIGAN Yes I guess it was one 'cause
HALLIGAN That 's just what I 'm trying to tell you sir It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters
HALLIGAN Now let me see a half hour after the Dooley sisters and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
HALLIGAN Huh
HALLIGAN It was late I know The Dooley sisters was already in They work at a show you know
HALLIGAN for the rheumatism you know
Do you know this young man Mrs Halligan
But I was n't here Mr Dickson Honest I was n't
Eleven o'clock eh Are you sure it was that
What time did you get in
So you were home last night
Then who changed it
I did n't do it I have n't got a gun
was n't anywhere near this place
They 're starting to come in already Yeah Yeah Well listen Do n't waste any time Get all the money you can lay your hands on and bring it down here right away Step on it
Charlie 's upstairs as sore as a pup He 's out fourteen cents and he ca n't find it
I guess so
Bought himself a pocketbook
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar
I 'm okay Matt
Okay Matt
Now you tell us
This is healing
TOM I could n't lose him
TOM I think I may just go on to the reservation
You can ride like that
He 's not bad at it
You 're just upset about Jesse We all are
Swear on Jimmy 's grave
Swear
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
What have you done
Leave me alone Bob
As long as people think Jesse 's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve
It 's still taking too long The people used to snap to
What
Frankly yes I 'm feeling a little left out
Say we bust into a bank We yell We 're the Younger-James Gang People are gon na be thinking The younger James Gang Is there an older James Gang How come we never heard of the older James gang So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms
No Jimmy has a point The Younger-James Gang could be confusing
Uhh yeah it does
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys
Zee I 'm pleased you came
That was two hours ago
Anywhere nobody 's shooting at me is pretty
Never a good thing
Dammit this stopped being fun about two years ago
Tomorrow
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior
He just lost his temper a little
They came up made the same offer they made you folks Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off one of those detectives hit him in the head knocked him out Cole lost his temper
Cole I want to get to the farm make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay
Jesus mercy that 's Charlie Higgins Dave Laller
Nope
Well somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES
I can hit those boys from here We just need a distraction
Tell me
What
He 's been full of vinegar lately
You are a fine figure of a man
Yes I am obviously not standing out in people 's minds at the robberies
You heard me Jesse You know how crazy I get
One false move and I 'll blow your heads off
Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars
The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk
Well no Jesse it was the bank 's That 's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it You explain it to him
Exactly
Not yet But I 'm hoping
Two
Best damn plan I heard all war
No really You 're wife said she needed some help seeing as you were so fat you could n't find your
I think I saw you leavin by the front door just as I was coming in the back
I think I recognize you
You ya barrel of pork lard Here piggy piggy
We did n't Zerelda did Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw
Pff All we been through the thought never crossed my mind
Missed you too cousin
Who 's next You Me Bob
I 'm out
Pass me some whisky
Clell Tom go get Doc Mimms in Liberty
A trap
You 'll be smiling once you 've got all that money to spend cousin Cole Younger 's going to make everybody rich
Then let me run the show General Lee
And I 'm the better outlaw
That 's it
I got us through the War all right
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea
You 're forgetting who 's in charge
What are you saying
Smells funny it being mentioned in the paper
It 'll be the biggest score yet
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity
Yep
Sure cousin
Twenty
It 's better It 's a construction depot They 'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take That way we can take on a bigger job
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words does n't make him smart
I got three
Do n't let it happen again
The James-Younger Gang
Perfect Cole
Just like in the war Harass their supply lines We kill the railroad 's men they wo n't care
This is n't a feud this is war They 've got more men than we do We kill detectives they can replace 'em in a day
Because we were good at it Hell we were great at it Jesse do n't tell anyone I said this because everybody knows I 'm the toughest man in this town but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns
It was exciting
After all you did on our farm You miss it do n't you Jesse
All right calm down I 'll agree Sadie was a woman
She had a moustache
You ever notice Zerelda 's eyes
What is wrong with you
Pick your fights cousin You taught me that
Hands off your hip Cole
Home boys Back to our farms
Where you boys going
I could use the walk
What 's going on
TOM I 'm thinking
TOM Hmm Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack or work for you
TOM You ride like a Comanche
TOM You pay me to find you Bluecoats There they are
They 're just insurance in case we run
Another dozen out back
Oh you 're in charge We ai n't partners any more Jesse You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride
Exactly Because this is a war
Hey We decide something that 's it We 're in this for the long haul and this idea of me and Jesse 's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin up on us in our sleep We 've got to think
BASTARDS Come back here and face me
Shakespeare He 's European
Sadie was not a man
The brown one
I think one of 'em 's glass
What the
Both would be nice
All right all right Jesse James never yelled at folk
This here is the Younger Gang
What
The safe Now
Go ahead to the saloon But do n't get too drunk
East East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass
Of St Louis
TOM Great Chief of St Louis send me
TOM You 'um big lawman
MAN Fine I 'll just wait here
MAN Oh Why did n't you just say so
MAN Then why ca n't I go in there
MAN I know it ai n't no durned bank holiday
I had you covered From back there
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank
What the
Yesss but I was thinking I could come by and then take Zee out Some place near With other folk Near Here But out
MIMMS Go on You 're pretty much all healed up
Go home Doc They ai n't gon na hang no more Liberty boys
Died a hero
Pff He jumped his horse clear over our heads killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them
rode right into them screaming like a banshee
He thinks this is some kind of game
MIMMS Well I hope the boy pulls through We should know in the morning
MIMMS They 're gone What are you
He 's going to be fine right Daddy
Daddy do n't start with this again
See you soon Oh and I appreciate the distraction back there
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
Yeah
Railroad burned him out too You could n't have stopped him
Jim was old enough
Got any ideas little brother
No I
Just do me a favor Think about what this is costing everybody Not just the railroad
We 're drunk
What do you want me to say Frank I was killing men when I was fifteen I like getting shot at I like riding out of town with a posse at my back This is a helluva better life than farming
We 're doing this for Ma
That 's a lie You could 've bought a dozen farms with the money we 've stolen
You 've killed your fair share of men
And we 're good at it
This has been a good year
Pardon the delay folks but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control
Bob 's upset
It 's the scientific method It 's all the rage
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives
And that 's why you both lead the gang Two of you went into that bank together right
We 're gon na have to talk
How 'd it go in there
Did n't think you would I 'm going to go make the coffin
We could move on Rebuild Make a decent life someplace else
Pinkertons It 's the railroad
You 're looking a bit more spry now that somebody
What do you think
Damn All that reading paid off
Heard of him
Your Zee Hmm From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive they sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back
Next time try fat and haggard
You are a charmer
Big and older
That just might work
Think about this If we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
Saved all our lives Doc None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms Doc God 's honest truth
Zee we got to talk to you and your father
Frank do n't you have something to say
Looks like Web Mimms was n't the only casualty this town 's got
Hello Liberty Missoura
Hell of a war
Web 's dead
See that 's your problem Frank By the time you finish figuring out stuff I 'm already finished doing it
That would have made an impression
Such as
So you 're saying I could have done more to attract their attention
Distracting enough for you
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling they try to shoot it off
How much of that story is true
Uncle Frank
So what was he
But he killed a lot of men too
They 're making him a hero now
Sounds like he was a hell of a man
I know But that 's how it should have ended Your Dad and Mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy
Yeah Jimmy
Shush
Take care of each other boys You say your prayers
Riders
Ma Please
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard nobody 'll ever find them
Easterners
Ma I 'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend
A fair number Ma
I 'll explain on the way
Yes ma'am
You are a hell of a woman
Yes ma'am
If you do n't see it it 's not real
Do n't turn around
Stop it This is just sad
Jesse have you ever noticed that when you 're trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy
Oh I 'm not finished When he sauntered into a saloon his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple As I said Hmm
Blazing Guns of the West True Stories of Jesse James Only a dime in the hotel lobby
But the life of the James Gang was n't all robbing and shooting and killing for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James
Hmm
I 've got you You keep me busy I figure we 'll get over to the hotel get checked in cleaned up then I 'd like to do something I 've been thinking about for a long time
That 's why I picked it We can start a whole new life down here
She 's beautiful Smart And has the biggest buck teeth in all of Missouri
She 's the most wonderful woman in the world Ca n't get her out of my mind
I had to see you I 'm getting married
Zee
Whose justice Yours or God 's When will you stop
Let the law
You and I we 've started something you know I do n't know what 'll happen if you do this
I am so sorry Jesse
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting
Is this one of Frank 's Shakespeare poems you 're trying to quote
Sparkling rocks
Honestly you 'd do if only you had the buck teeth
Smart Funny Bossy Always makes me think she 's two steps ahead of me And big buck teeth
Not if I find the right girl
Mostly It would be an all right life for a bachelor
Arr Hand over your jewels Missy
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older
So you 're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole We 're all so proud of you Jesse And not a single farm 's been sold to the railroad since You 're everybody 's hero
I should n't tease a hero
Teasing you is completely unfair
You 're sick of my company
You should n't be up
Jesse is that your hand
Jesse are you awake
But still died
You were little Jesse James when you left
Fair enough
Thanks
He 's too important James They 'll set the army on you You and your wife
No I 'll hang you But I may miss you just a bit
You cocky little bastard
That 's what I would have done
Was it worth it
Oh That 's nice to know We 're going to hang you you know
I went myself to oversee the operation Did n't help much
Damn
Yes
Mmm
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell
You almost ended my career before it began
Did you order our houses burned down
So I 'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains
But I like the presidential suite
Communion
Now let 's have a drink
Thank you
I could have lied I suppose but I want this marriage to be legal I just want you to know I 'm trying to start a new life here I 'm depending on your
You do n't think God 'll mind do you
You 're gon na tell her when you 're resting up in bed with her Jimmy
This time we 'll make an exception
It 's his money He 's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains do n't you Jesse
You do that
I swear
I think so
You been with a girl ever
Tonight Why I 'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole Now it 's my turn
Not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink
You okay Jesse
I like that
I 'm the same age you were when you went off to war
Do n't talk about it much though
Devereux My brother Cole dated a European girl once
Why do n't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk
Gosh that 's a pretty name Buy you a drink
Thank you Miss
Not at all
Really
Oh you were talking to Jesse
Why yeah
There 's only four of them
How can that be
They had to be dealt with
It 's not my job to relax I 've put men facing out both ways down Main Street so nobody can ride in shooting I 've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case
I 'm doing you folks a favor
Not such a menace now is he Pinkerton
I remember you
Oh that I 'll let Jenkins explain
What sir
Sir
I look forward to seeing it
We should go burn that school to the ground sir
What is going on here man
We did
To be precise they did n't blow up the tracks
Thirty-five thousand sir Coins and currency And the delay from the miles of destroyed track
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards killing several of them Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile
I see I 'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers
Yes sir
Unfortunately not sir A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable Mr Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident
Two weeks ago we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers
I can completely understand your distress sir
Really
Mr Thaddeus Rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field
What the hell is that sound
What is that
Can you put men at all four
In English Pinkerton
No
It 's going to be a long spring
No you demand results They are not the same thing And if you want results you will let me do my job as I see fit Unless of course You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it
Yes that 's the way to win the locals back to our side
I ca n't believe this
All of the James Gang 's encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this group 's cunning
It 's going to be a long winter
Hardly farmers I 've done some checking All these were in the War These men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them They are disciplined well-trained and have a charismatic leader If I were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what I would create
It 's early in the game yet Mr Rains Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves feeling out each other 's patterns
The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land Who wrote this I 'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month
A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St Louis Missouri The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West
This is no game
I want them arrested and hanged
You would n't have done that
Look at this Pinkerton They got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least
Yes
Yes Courtney
You look marvelous There 's nothing to say You 're going to marry Luis Next week no Less
You never noticed
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura 's but-you know how Luis is
That 's nice
What are you doing tonight

Well we have to end apartheid for one And slow down the nuclear arms race stop terrorism and world hunger But we ca n't ignore our social needs either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women 's freedom of choice
Oh come on Price There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about Sure our foreign policy is important but there are more pressing problems at hand

Hello
You actually listen to Whitney Houston You actually have a Whitney Houston CD More than one
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys Patrick You 're making me feel weird
No I 'm not a lesbian Why do you think I 'd be into that
Does he do this all the time
Let 's not get lewd I 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation
Patrick you re a lunatic
Do you have any coke Or Halcyon I 'd take a Halcyon
Did you know that guy who disappeared Did n't he work at Pierce Pierce too Was he a friend of yours
Paul Owen
You 're at Paul Owen s
Why would I
He 's a goddamn drug dealer These are his peak hours
She 's from France
She 's my cousin
What do you mean she was a hot number
Oh right Of course We had wanted Paul Owen to come But he said he had plans I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night
So who was he with
Where was Marcus
I checked it out It 's clean
Yes
Yes
Yes And he denies it Though at first he could n't be sure
I 've questioned him
According to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner with Marcus Halberstam
I think maybe you 've got your dates mixed up
So the night he disappeared Any new thoughts on what you did
Yes of course The hash browns are delicious I 'm just not ordering them
Not in the mood I guess
I 'll be there
No I like music Just-they're-Huey 's too black sounding For me
Never I mean I do n't really like singers
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen 's disappearance it would make my job a lot easier
Listen I 'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I 've sorted out all this information
Well thank you Mr Bateman
Well When was the last time you were with Paul Owen
Let 's see That you were with
That 's not the information I 've received
Wait That 's not what I 've got
God I guess I was probably returning videotapes
Not really
I actually came to see Timothy Price but he 's taken a leave of absence
I mean they want to get caught
Yeah No Finlandia as usual Fucking dump
How 's the investigation going Taken anyone in for formal questioning
So you hang out here a lot
Detective Kendall uh Campbell KIMBALL Kimball Call me Don
Absolutely I 'm 100 with you
Oh really I did n't know that
Is n't the Four Seasons a little far uptown I mean are n't you going to be late
Eerie Really eerie
People just disappear
It 's just strange One day someone 's walking around going to work alive and then
No not yet As I said we 're not sure But basically no one has seen or heard anything
No it actually had n't Toiletries were missing A suit was gone So was some luggage That 's it
No
Yeah I know and was into that whole Yale thing
I know it sounds like a lame question but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question but last month-I do n't know if you 've heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
Was he involved at all do you think in occultism or Satan worship
Well I 've had a hard time getting an actual verification A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but I checked it out and what happened is he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul so
Actually yes
His girlfriend does n't think so
Well there 's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London
So was I
Anything else you can tell me about Owen
Do n't you know this
No he just hung out there
Let me think The Newport Harry 's Fluties Endochine Nell 's Comell Club The New York Yacht Club The regular places
Hang out
No Not really
I hope I 'm not being cross-examined here
He led what I suppose was an orderly life He ate a balanced diet
What do you mean Yale thing
Yale thing
How well did you know him
What can you tell me about Paul Owen
You sure
Would you rather I not smoke
Bad habit
Who do you ask
Thanks
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street The American Gardens Building
Harvard The Harvard Business School
Twenty-six I 'll be twenty-seven in October
Shoot

Oh no I 'm okay
KIMBALL
Perrier San Pellegrino
Coffee
Ah I see Yes Paul 's disappearance Yes
You 're not with the FBI or anything are you
So what 's the topic of discussion
Hi Pat Bateman Nice to meet you
Oh that Just mulling over business problems Examining opportunities Exchanging rumors Spreading gossip
Listen John I 've got to go T Boone Pickens just walked in Just joking No do n't tip the owner of the salon Okay John right got it Sorry about that
MAN I ca n't I ca n't find a shelter

It 's cold out too is n't it
Yes it is
No Owen
Yes Owen
They 're okay BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste But then Sports came out in 1983 I think they really came into their own commercially and artistically
Come on you dumb son of a bitch I 've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us
Two-hundred-and-fifty Very reasonable Let 's leave a big tip shall we My place hr a nightcap
Another Martini Paul
Cecelia is well you know
I could tell you that Halberstam but then I 'd have to kill you
Nobody goes there anymore
Hey I 'm a child of divorce Give me a break Hmmm I see they 've omitted the pork loin with lime jello
Listen the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here
And how 's Cecilia She 's a great girl
Really That 's interesting Not great
How 's the Ransom account going Marcus
Hello Halberstam Nice tie How the hell are you
I just do n't see how someone anyone can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit How can you be so fucking I do n't know cool about it
PATTEN What shit Now where do we have reservations at I mean I 'm not really hungry but I would like to have reservations somewhere
PATTEN Good point Excuse me gentlemen
PATTEN You think so
I ca n't help it I feel like they 'd do anything to keep their
You do n't wan na move do you
I 'm just screwed
Make him
Gon na wait outside
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs
You 're just afraid to eat it
It 's gon na get cold
Great
Oh right Hold on
Milo
What
You look beautiful
Great
No No I sent an E-mail to somebody just now To tell her how I feel about you You know I 'm clueless without you You know I
Are you gon na tell me where you went
I know you think I 'm too attached to him but still I am close to Gary And you 're the most meaningful person in my life I 'm going back to the Comix place why should I be killing myself
It 's for the Museum He knows you 're a painter If anybody should be invited
Why does n't he ask us to his party He 's never even met you
Look at this
Where were you You know you ca n't keep anything from me
That was different
If I 'd stayed down there maybe this wouldn't 've happened
After I broke into 21 which was insane thank God they did n't catch me I just drove around Trying to figure out what possessed me You know what I 've been putting my own guilt on Gary
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when
Why
Nothing
It 's almost nine I 've been so worried What did you see in there
Whaddo I do
Is it two Or is it three Have you ever really noticed
You ca n't just walk in either
Milo you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place How could they hope to hide a surveillance post And how can you get in there anyway With the cameras and the swipe cards
Even if all this were true There 're 20 other buildings All of them filled with computers and
Milo Why would he
Like this It 's Gary you 're talking about
You 're scaring me I think we should just go
Nobody does work like this on-line It 's in your PC or in a mainframe Self-contained They 'd have to be like watching people Physically Oh Jesus
I do n't know I just know it was Teddy 's code All these ideas flying in from everywhere You know how he says Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business It 's like they know what every kid 's doing
I do n't know what I 'm saying Maybe maybe they hired those guys
It was a hate crime
Teddy was killed last night
You 're right It 's a working relationship Do n't know what I was expecting
What 's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach Eat another sesame seed and that 's it
If you ca n't deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
He 's your boss He 's not your
What would it mean anyway If he did n't write it
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning I said Did you really do this just today Cause I was impressed He said What 're you implying
To our new life What 's wrong
You know he 's never been anybody 's counselor before
That took some fun out of
When 's Brian coming for the TV
Do n't bring that up Like a different girlfriend would'd 've let you die
No way You have this destiny
Did n't you visit the campus
I think that 's great Milo I do
But he 's not quite the same guy anymore Do n't get your hopes too high
Bully Are we talking about Gary Boyd Or your dad
It 's important
A lot of what Larry says is true They just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they
I think I kind of lost it I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful 'Did n't know I even cared about that stuff
He was n't acting
Prick
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl Fire her Or something
He 'll tell me when he gets home
No
Yes sir
'Just did n't know who else to talk to
I just wan na help bring these guys to justice They 're neo-Nazis
It was racially motivated He 's Chinese He was And I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that Do n't they
My friend my best friend Teddy was killed in Silicon Valley
I am I am sir
Have a seat
Milo
Yes sir I need to talk to you
Mr Barton do you remember me
It 's just I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability Create something
Right What 's that mean again
You should 've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
He 's working backwards too Let 's do number five
Is it your dish
Gim me the coordinates
Wan na be a part of history
Great Great We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door
What 'd they ever do for you
No But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this We 're gon na bring down Outpost
Brian You wan na be a big deal do n't you That 's your dream in life
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software You 'd be my partner
Well I parked illegally See y'later
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case I 'm writing programs for the local public access station Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show God does it suck Can you help me
PUNDIT You better believe everybody 's trying to sign him up
PUNDIT Milo Surprised he 's not your guest
PUNDIT Stigma Larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
PUNDIT There 's no hard evidence he knew about this Anybody who could implicate him seems to 've vanished
PUNDIT Conglomerates 're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites They 'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line
PUNDIT Outpost was his baby sure On the other hand we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites Personally
I think they call him the Houseman 'Cause guard sounds too weird
He just likes to write code He 's bummed there 's so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
He 's pretty tight with his family
Oh hi
I do know You focus on the big problem But somewhere down the chain something breaks down Something gets destroyed At first it 's upsetting You feel you 've lost control
I do know Gary I feel the same way I thought I was coming here for a job But it 's meant a lot more
You see what 's hanging on the wall
Oh that 's right You 're clueless
You could 've handwritten it
Dear Lisa I 've enjoyed working with you I 'd be lying if I did n't say I find you attractive But in my heart I know that Alice You left my party to send E-mail
That 's great Thanks
Cause he was a liar And I hated him Get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world The more he mocked me the deeper I went Cause if being savvy meant being like him Guess that 's why I 'm kind of clueless even now Did n't cultivate my conniving side 'Not sure I even have one
No I just went deeper into the machine Preferred being the geek to having to explain Lying would 've been worse
My dad was a compulsive gambler Only he did n't think he was That applied to guys who did n't have a system Losers who played games of chance He could read people so chance had nothing to do with it No matter how deep a hole he dug himself he 'd give you the whole speech And you 'd better not point out the obvious His creditors would catch up to him Loan sharks or whatever He 'd wake us in the middle of the night Off we 'd go again
Sure
I 'm okay It 's going well
Gary hi
The wrong place
34,000 But they 're real short lines 'Just came out that way
It helps Alice said it would help To focus on something 'Do n't know what I 'd do without her
Oh Yeah
Talk about work Never
Just once 'Guess I was worried we did n't have anything to talk about since work was off-limits Non disclosure
Were the flags for Teddy
Definitely
The purpose of this company is n't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath But the software business is binary you 're a zero or a one Being obsessive is n't a crime It 's a character trait
Everything I do is under scrutiny The questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid I 'm confused Does n't everybody in business try to get ahead
What 're you implying
Right Right
Milo What 's up
You did this overnight
It 's okay Really
Maybe I 'm going too fast
Do n't spend too much time searching You ever vetted somebody 's old code before It 's a different skill Stay close to the surface The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight You know the best place to hide a leaf right In a tree
That 's what I told her My wife
Somebody said I 'm just another Philistine With reproductions
'Think I should buy some originals
No Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
I do
You 'd have to start practically from scratch But this is all you 'd be working on No marketing meetings no product seminars We ca n't waste the time Half the Valley 's working on convergence So 're media conglomerates cable companies phone companies 'Ca n't finish second Milo There is no second Now what would you like to ask me
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms Really omniplatforms Including whatever new hardware emerges
Among other things We know convergence is the real super-highway all the PC 's TV 's phones etc linked together Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky
I 've only shown this to three other people I bought 200 we 've launched 12 so far I keep the coordinates in this room It 's left over from SDI Reagan 's Star Wars technology They orbit 426 miles up
You know a lot about art I guess
Would you like a Coke or something
You would Wow When would we come 'Think he hung up
Hello
Gary
What
Longitude 109
Ready for number three
Okay 2
Gary do n't worry we
Nothing does Still I want him to like me
There may be a little less trust after your outburst
Maybe we should all get on it
This is good Who did it
You guys 'll be using Teddy 's old space is that okay
You wan na work here
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water
Man could he write code Totally elegant He had his own style
He was on the verge of something too He was gon na show us the next day He said The answer 's not in the box it 's in the band Know what it means
You are naive Look at your employment contract you ca n't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years Not that I do n't miss you
I mean it 's your life
I think you should go
All the companies know The faculties tell 'em At the target schools
Now what are we doing I do n't get any of this shit
Come with me
You calling Phil and Randy
Get the backslash the colon keys kids do n't use but geeks do What would Milo want in here anyway
Delbert seems to enter 21 twice Without leaving the first time
What 're we looking for
Every entry was authorized
Unlikely All 14 cameras are frozen Do we call Randy and Phil Tell 'em there may have been a break-in
Wait a second He knows I know
He 's been altering the coordinates since we logged on He 's a step ahead Let 's jump to 12
He knows
Maybe it 's the satellite
Bring it to the other location
They know I had no choice Get out of the house now Do you have a laptop
Meet me at the other location
Please do n't go
Why
Does he know you know
That 's lame is n't it
Perfect How am I gon na get away from the party long enough to
Milo What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M And tells them about it
Yeah that 's old in a tree
He does n't know about the Day Care
Milo Shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
The dishes are juiced up too
Gary
A beautiful geek What 're the chances
I told Teddy about you
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
Why were you snooping in my office
Why were you so careless
I do n't know
Oh man I 'd have to get into Gary 's house To get the satellite positions
Gary knows I 'm close on Skywire We have to do this fast
You 'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop Maybe some audio too To tie it all in to Gary How long would that take you
It 's how on-line services push logos they wan na sell you You do n't ask for 'em they just appear 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house And then the quality of the broadcast would n't exactly be digital that 's 12 months away
We ca n't just assume they 're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch I 'd have to write in an aglet
What
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary 's set-top device That also takes out CNN GE joins Outpost in new venture which means NBC is out Disney joins Outpost ABC is out Outpost and Newscorp in new deal Fox is out Any of these places could have a mole Or all of 'em It 's like a a continuous loop We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read get them and us killed But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary 's got a finger in
Say there 's just one mole working there like Barton at the DOJ How do we know he 's not the guy we 've contacted Or she Or the guy she works for
Yeah they dig stuff like this CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001
He 's buying up pretty much everything cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives Getting ready for Skywire
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership But not on our own computers Not even at home
The mainstream media TV or a newsmagazine
Do we post it on the Net
Who can we trust
What about the FBI
I always felt if a boy I liked ever found out he 'd run He 'd think I was unclean
Milo
He 's out of prison
Is that my scenario Tell me
I know why you 're so secretive Why you wo n't let anybody near you I know what he did to you
But why would they
The Day Care
Why would you do a thing like
She saved my life
Then and now But not right now
Long story Not that interesting
Mmm-more like I have a little trouble Trusting people
Maybe once I re-wrote it anyway
Mine 's not the CEO He barely remembers to take a shower
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps How fast are you going
Did you wan na be alone
Cool
Graphical interfaces For Skywire I 'm s'posed to coordinate with you
No I know what you mean I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers Least they make sense Sometimes you think they 've betrayed you Like a person would But then you see no you just missed a step You can go back and make it all work
Did n't mean to pry I just have this theory Some of us who got to good at this We were escaping something
Me too Were you an Army brat or something
Were you
I 'm getting a teacher 's pet rep
You know mine
Lisa
Milo geeks do n't have two girlfriends Most do n't have one
I dunno I guess Larry 's got me totally suspicious of that place
A beautiful geek I do n't wan na sound paranoid or like a pig but what 're the chances
Did you tell Alice
What Come on Is it serious
I 'm cool They did n't touch the machine Or my disks Probably did n't know what they were So you a Moonie yet Milo
They 're in the neighborhood They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers
But these like White Supremacists trashed my office last week
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale You know what 's the bad part We ca n't talk about work anymore We 're competitors The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms
Wanted to say goodbye to him
Is that how Larry feels
You got my E-mail
Gary 's not into fiber optics He 's betting everything on the satellites
What 're they building
I 've got a girlfriend remember
She 's a programmer
Well he micro-managed the company till it got too big 'Guess he needs to micro-manage something
So how 'd you like the house
So how far are we from the campus
Damn 'Have to go back over there Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
Yeah yeah
Maybe he 'll get back to work
Can we buy into their IPO Or is that a Justice Dept problem
We 're all grateful for that Really Go out the way you came in
Fellas I 'm gon na have to ask you to leave here now
Where is he
You 're not listening
That kid 's the great white hope
There 's nothing in this hall Someone 's pulling your chain as usual
What is it
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem 'Press the button pull the chain out comes a chocolate choo-choo train
Damn What exactly do you do at Virtucon
Is it about my teeth
Kiss me
Thank you that 's beautiful To your health
That 's very clever Do you know any other poems
Mmmm I feel extreme relaxation
Sak-i it to me

EVIL Really there 's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster
EVIL Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of Face it freedom failed
EVIL Well done Mr Powers We 're not so different you and I It 's true you 're British and I 'm Belgian You have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding You 're thin I 'm about forty pounds overweight OK we are different I 'm not making a very good point However is n't it ironic Mr Powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the Nineties considered to be evil Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
EVIL No Mr Powers I expect them to die Even after they pay me the money I 'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma All right guard begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism
EVIL Oh forget it As a fellow player on the international stage Mr Powers I 'm sure you 'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act
EVIL Do n't try to suck up to me It 's a little late for that I 'm a freak Look at it it 's been rendered useless
Behave
That 's fab because I love you too Vanessa
Lay it on me
I 'll secure the perimeter
Austin I 'm coming with you
Are you crazy
Hold on a tick let me put on my togs
I can explain They attacked me Gas came out of her well and then they and I
It 's not what it looks like Vanessa At ease boys
Anyways what I 'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man well that 's just groovy because I love you
Listen Vanessa whatever happens I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden I do n't know what happened The whole time I was shagging her I mean really shagging her I mean it was crazy I was like a huge mechanical piston in and out IN and OUT
Too right youth That 's why I need you to lead the troops
We 've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag You go get help I 'm gon na stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor
Fair enough
It 's a shame he was n't more headstrong
That 's not the way to get ahead in life
Not a good time to lose one 's head
No no no We 'll use the floss to get to the ledge
Sadly no Hold on I always keep this on me just in case
Not now Austin
Yes act naturally and we 'll split this scene the way we came in Vanessa
Do n't worry baby I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India I learned it from my guru the late Guru Shastri a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis Just watch me Watch me now
I 'm looking at you and the whole time I ca n't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch
You know who
Do you think she 's prettier than I
I 'll tell him By the way I 've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night
Thirty years of political and social upheaval The fall of the Berlin wall a female Prime Minister of England the abolishment of Apartheid a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang
You just do n't get it do you Austin Good night Welcome to the Nineties you 're going to be very lonely
Well it means something to me If you want us to have a relationship you 've got to be a one-woman man
Not in the Nineties
No did you use a condom
I ca n't believe you made love to her just like that Did you use protection
Listen I know I 'm just being neurotic but I ca n't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary Ms Fagina I mean I do n't want to sound paranoid but I 've had some bad relationships in the past and I have some jealousy issues You went to her penthouse It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities but I ca n't help but feel this weird irrational unfocused well jealousy I 'm sorry
Austin may I have a word with you
Really Austin
It 's not that I 'm drunk I 'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about What was my mother like back in the Sixties I 'm dying to know
I 'm not I 'm the sensible one I 'm always the designated driver
I am not
No this is me in a nutshell
I 'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die
I 'm sorry
Go Just go
Watch out you 're on my hair
Fancy a nibble
I hate having my picture taken
Unfortunately while you told that stupid story Dr Evil has escaped
I do n't get it
We ca n't just sit here Austin
Let 's go get him
How do you know
Let me see
We 've got a doctor 's appointment an evil doctor 's appointment
Good morning Vanessa I hope you have on clean underwear
Good morning luv who are you on the phone with
Why did you leave so soon
I ca n't see a bloody thing
Here use mine
I think I 'll give that stew a ding-a ling
Hey who put this in here Someone 's playing a prank on me Honestly this is n't mine
No actually I do n't know how to put this really Well there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry
Yes we 've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone an on-board computer and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device Oh and finally this
I understand that Mr Powers but let me be perfectly clear with you perhaps to the point of being insulting I will never have sex with you ever If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation I still would not have sex with you
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process
What
Sure
That 's right You 're supposed to say 'colored now right Here 's the stewardesses Bring on the sexy stews
You know a Chigro part Chinese part Negro Chigro
Have you ever made love to a Chigro
My meat and two veg
My wedding tackle
I 've been frozen for thirty years man I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working
That 's fascinating Vanessa Listen why do n't we go into the back and shag
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet eh How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense
Listen Mr Powers I look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby You can address me as Agent Kensington We have to leave immediately We 've preserved your private jet just as you left it It 's waiting at Heathrow Airport
My mother 's doing quite well thank you very much
My mother 's told me all about you
Mr Powers my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties You know a lot 's changed since 1967
I do n't even know what this is This sort of thing ai n't my bag baby
I 'm telling you baby that 's not mine
That 's not mine
Danger 's my middle name
Actually my name 's Austin Powers
Where did you learn to shoot
I 'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert
No no I want you to have it even if it 's my last piece
Do n't mind if I do
Here have a piece of gum
Everything seems to be in order
Hi folks You 're entering a restricted zone Can I see your security badges
OPERATOR Commander I have to log it
OPERATOR Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept
OPERATOR In many ways Bob 's Big Boy never left sir He 's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices
OPERATOR It appears to be in the shape of Bob 's Big Boy sir
OPERATOR No Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy not stealthy not carbon composite It does have an odd shape sir
OPERATOR Commander this is Slater in SoWest Com Three We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle
EVIL Right Okay Moving on
EVIL You 've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet Excuse me
EVIL Some of you I know some of you I 'm meeting for the first time
EVIL We 've got a lot of work to do
Ahhhhhhhhh
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process emdash
But Dr Evil all you need to do is work with this tennis ball Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day A few months of that and it 'll be just as strong as the other arm
But my design was perfect Your autonomic functions were shut down and even though your arm was n't frozen the aging was retarded therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left
EVIL Really Are they ill-tempered
EVIL Right
EVIL I have one simple request sharks with friggin laser beams attached to their heads and it ca n't be done Remind me again why I pay you people What do we have
EVIL What is it now
FARBISSINA It 's about the sharks Since you were frozen they 've been placed on the Endangered Species List We tried to get some but it will take months to clear up the red tape
FARBISSINA Dr Evil
EVIL I like to see girls of that caliber By caliber I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character Forget it
EVIL Quite impressive
EVIL Breathtaking Frau These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers
EVIL Austin Powers is getting too close He must be neutralized Any suggestions
EVIL My son
EVIL Yes
That 's not true Doctor Please tell us about your childhood
We 've heard from Scott now let 's hear from you
Do n't be so hard on yourself You 're here that 's what 's important A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
EVIL Evil actually Doctor Evil
EVIL Scott do n't say that
EVIL I had the group liquidated you little shit They were insolent
EVIL Show me
EVIL Blow me
EVIL I do n't want to
EVIL No Scott You just do n't get it do you
EVIL No we 'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and we 'll just assume it all went to plan
EVIL Fine Whatever Mutated ill-tempered sea bass it is Come let 's return to dinner Close the tank
EVIL Why do n't you just shoot him now Here I 'll get a gun We 'll just shoot him Bang Dead Done
EVIL But what if he escapes Why do n't you just shoot him What are you waiting for
EVIL Why are you feeding him Why do n't you just kill him
EVIL Yeah What
EVIL Thought I 'd stay in There 's a good tittie movie on Skinemax
EVIL Well me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and like they do n't speak English right and so my buddy gets into a fight and he goes 'hey quit hassling me cause I do n't speak French or whatever and the other guy goes something in Paris talk and I go 'um just back off and he goes 'get out and I go 'make me
EVIL You always do that Anyways this is really hard because you know my Dad is really evil
EVIL No Maybe like work in a petting zoo or something
EVIL Not me
EVIL I have n't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship I hate you
EVIL Hi
TWO Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year
TWO Do n't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars A million dollars is n't that much money these days
TWO Umm that also has already happened
TWO Um Dr Evil Prince Charles did have an affair He admitted it and they are now divorced actually
TWO We also own the Franklin mint which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors Some plates like the Gone With The Wind series have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved
I 'm on with a friend Look I 'd better go I love you
KENSINGTON I know Let me just say this Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had
KENSINGTON Austin is very charming very debonair He 's handsome witty has a knowledge of fine wines sophisticated a world-renowned photographer Women want him men want to be him He 's a lover of love every bit an International Man of Mystery
KENSINGTON Of course not I was married to your father
KENSINGTON Just wait Once Austin gets you in his charms it 's impossible to get out
KENSINGTON You have to understand in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth It did n't matter
KENSINGTON You ca n't judge him by modern standards He 's very much a product of his times In my day he could have any woman he wanted
KENSINGTON Because you managed to resist Austin Power 's charms
KENSINGTON I 'm proud of you
KENSINGTON You did n't
KENSINGTON How 's Austin
KENSINGTON Oh hello Vanessa How was the flight
EVIL I just think like he hates me I really think he wants to kill me
EVIL No he 's really evil
EVIL I do n't know I was thinking maybe I 'd be a vet or something cause I like animals and stuff
EVIL I do n't wan na take over the family business
EVIL OK Well I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago He was partially frozen for thirty years I never knew him growing up He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
EVIL Well it 's kind of weird
No need I 'll call again
There are limits
You do n't say How real does it feel
Seriously
Sir August Merryweather I was looking for something relaxing Say a Tuscan hillside in June
Shame I was recommended By a friend
DARLING Ah but you have n't see the real me Watch closely
So I 'm still
DARLING Three days
DARLING Peter
DARLING Fear
DARLING Hope
DARLING Secret
DARLING Nature
DARLING Flower
DARLING Love
DARLING Black
head
bottle
Sir August What now
AUGUST There look
AUGUST Ah beautiful Just as he promised
Have we met
AUGUST Out in India So character-forming for the British Not the heat Good Lord no The rain dash it A good monsoon Fifteen inches overnight A whole week of lovely rain I remember one summer in Jaipur
AUGUST You do n't get rain like you used to in England A good shower that 's the ticket Stiffens resolve puckers the spirit quells the namby-pamby in a man
Really what happened in 1922
I have an appointment
As you see
Impossible
Mr John Steed please
You and I Together But first you must confront your greatest enemy Who could that be Mrs Peel The answer is obvious
People too
Quite right but we still make the rules
Congratulations Mrs Peel You have been a worthy opponent You have tracked us down You are within an ace of winning
Your voice it 's so familiar
Quite a collection
Sir August Sir August
Ahem As I was saying perhaps another macaroon
About your next assignment Mrs Peel
The doors and walls are monitored Mrs Peel This is a very secure establishment
This is an official matter Mrs Peel No need to take it personally Where are you going
Who
The Institute the funding
To you
I thought I was a widow My husband the only man I ever loved is dead For the rest of my life I have to live with that
What are you trying to do to me
You need treatment Mrs Peel You ca n't resign
After the cold war
Directed by laser Bounced by satellite Quite possible
He tried to warn us
Ropes
Something strange is happening And whoever knows about it does n't want us to find out
Let me guess 'Father
Looks like rain Steed
Close We 're so hush-hush even we know nothing about it Now let 's see there 's coconut cake date and walnut I recommend the rum baba
Choices
Speaking of Peter there 's more good news You wo n't even have to change your last name You 'll always be Mrs Peel
The missing piece of the jigsaw I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter I tried to steal it from you as Dr Darling As myself I 'll be a bit less subtle With this ring my plan will be complete
Then what 's stopping you
The result would be
Such as
You 're mad
Ring
Valentine listen to me
Come come you 're a widow a most attractive widow Now I think of it we 'll need a bridesmaid Here
Think of this as your second wedding feast
'Our revels now are ended
But why
But I found you All the clues led me here
Too many cooks
You killed my husband
Dr Darling Peter all you
Darling Emma yes we the true genius behind the Prospero Project
Thanks Valentine
Must be Trubshaw 's busy I 'll send Mother
Pity your mother came too
Not quite
It 's the latest thing Mrs Peel
As a matter of fact I have
English weather You know after all we 've been through I should say we deserve a long holiday
A fine night Mrs Peel
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea
What kept you
If you 'd been through what I have you would n't
But
You need n't bother I ca n't drag you further into this After all I am still the chief suspect
Where are you going
Have a look at this
'The Merry Widow I might have known Where 's the reception
Snuff I must insist you try some
Shall we
When all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
What is it
It 's called Black Leather
Have we been invited
You did n't tell her
We must hurry Mrs Peel
Are n't you coming
Why 's he called 'Invisible
I 'm a wanted woman I know
Not to speak of Peter and I were both loners There was nobody
Or grown-ups who still like to be children
No idea who No idea why
I equivocated But you 're not their big worry at present It 's Dr Darling he 's disappeared
I told Mother I took care of you
You do n't trust me
After you Mrs Peel
Winning is n't everything
I thought you did n't
Are n't we all Mrs Peel
Not for a moment
Is that all
Mmm what are you doing
I could be convinced if I knew who poisoned me in the maze That kiss
when I do n't It comes down to one thing Mrs Peel Trust
Always Except
No trouble
Nothing personal
Orders
It was Peter I saw him
Was I
Where am I
Steed
Someone did n't want us to get to the party
This must be the last straw
Barely
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative We 're being followed I saw him at Trubshaw 's
Oh well Just my type Mrs Peel
According to Dr Darling you 're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior Q.E.D
And by you Mrs Peel Everything points to you No sisters No undiscovered twin
And by you Mrs Peel
Sounds as if someone 's hijacked your research
But if someone miniaturized the process
Filling in mother nature 's blind spots
Is there anything that is n't
Do n't bother Here 's a bus
Thanks I see what you mean about letting me do the risking Hello
She had this in her mouth There there
Is that written in his shoe
Any ideas
Very good Steed
How on earth can you tell
I should have thought that was obvious I 'm in mourning
You mean my other self
Did you say formal I must dress
No But he must know Incidentally my double left you with this
That 's possible Sir August was convinced he 'd met me before But I 'd never met him Another odd thing When it rained he said it was just as someone had promised
But that 's absurd I may not be over-fond of you Steed but it 's not my style
You told them You said I arrived on a camel shot you four times Left you for dead
Mother and Dr Darling have me under observation They think I tried to kill you
I mean your man Trubshaw Your bullet-proof waistcoat I thought you were just overdressed
You were very lucky Four shots to the heart I found you after I slipped away from Sir August Mother brought you here Not me you should thank
You should be dead How do you feel
Small talk Try the weather
All of a piece really A fanatical weatherman Chairman of BROLLY British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years Thinks British weather has been tampered with by aliens
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
Not so much eccentric More barking mad He has a wife called June And a daughter somewhere Julie
According to Mother Sir August owns half of the Highlands A millionaire Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry Now
No thanks
I have no choice Why should you risk your life
Just what is your position if you do n't mind my asking How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work
Do we always follow Mother 's instructions
Sir August Merryweather why are we seeing him first
The most unpredictable piece on the board And always ready to protect his queen
A Gentleman has to have a code This is part of mine A uniform Think of it as my suit of shining armor
Not all Tradition is bad Mrs Peel No thank you
Do you really think so
Thank you Trubshaw
Ahh Perfect fit The luxury of a hand-made shoe As unique as a face or a fingerprint Or should I say DNA
Or half cocked
I thought we were on our way
Do you
Really I fail to see the connection
A kipper Or a red herring What were they investigating
We 're not here to talk about the weather surely
Mother
And now that we 've settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you
Under the circumstances you may call me Mrs Peel
And just what is the game
Rules are made to be broken
Whereas you are
So what was all this some sort of test
1922 Why the kippers
I had a spot of bother at the door
And you must be Steed Please do n't get up
And you 've a new wardrobe He does want you to look attractive He tells me you 're very beautiful
Emma in Wonderland Welcome Mrs Peel We 've been expecting you We hope you 'll enjoy your stay with us Decontamination is almost complete
You do n't believe him
Where 's Mother
Think of it as special assignment Mrs Peel With a twist You 're our chief suspect
Your mission is simple Find out how and why these agents died
JONES You 're not venturing alone surely
JONES Very good Mrs Peel
JONES Privately owned by
JONES X marks the spot The shoes were delivered to an island in Hyde Park Surrounded by the Serpentine On the site of a former Ministry installation
JONES Under the circumstances Mother did n't see fit but I think I can get you in
JONES The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative
JONES I was getting to it
JONES Makes two of us
JONES Father She gave him an 'all clear after a security test by Dr Darling
JONES Do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother in-law was under surveillance
JONES Now let 's see Eton Cambridge research into robotics and plastics Overtaken by Peter 's work on the physics of climate change
Peter 's brother But
JONES Or rather you do n't Learnt the tricks in camouflage Till this accident made a prang of things How can I help you Mrs Peel
JONES Talk to the pipe Mrs Peel That usually helps Do n't worry about me being invisible Other than that I 'm perfectly normal
Mother betrayed me She was going to replace me with a younger Father Errand boy that 's all I was 'Find Steed
You reek of Mrs Peel 's Black Leather
Steed
We want Mrs Peel
So you say
Jungle plants in the Arctic A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland Blizzards in summer
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns
In your operation
I 'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own If I 'm right Mrs Peel is innocent and you have a mole
I was hoping you could tell me
Guilty until proven innocent
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation On the day he died he was setting a test To prove to himself to us that his wife was beyond suspicion He had to be certain He said he was going to give Mrs Peel something
No Her husband she says Alice tried to warn us A trap Tell Mother beware Tell Father That 's all
Impossible
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late Someone tipped them off
Anyone particular in mind
How come you took so much interest in her Dr Darling
She may try to kill you
Who knows If Dr Darling is right you should watch out
Possibly Split personality
She may not know Theory goes she may be very ill
Perhaps I 'd better start calling you doctor again Mrs Peel
Oh yes I did I want you to meet somebody I expect you 'll like her
Weather 's turning nasty
Mother I thought you were burglars
Wonderland Weather Ltd
LADY Good Glad to see they 're together at last They do n't get along Promotion Top job Most unfair Quite a fuss at the Ministry
LADY You with Mother or Father
LADY I 'm Alice Mother said you 'd be on your way Mrs Peel with you
LADY Cocky little bastard I hope he was a baddy
LADY Are you alright young man
AUGUST Let it be rain please let it be
AUGUST No please I beg you
AUGUST Mrs Peel
I think she really likes you Where 's Mrs Peel
You are and it 's behind you
Did I My mistake

Rules are made to be broken
One shot for emergencies

Aw man Stephen listen to me
Let me take the lead Stephen
It is n't safe man Do n't go splittin us up Not with this one

Kind of an asshole was n't he
You know Knowlton pretty well
Goddamn it Stephen lay off You stupid dumbshit you never know when to fucking quit do you You ever wonder why your career 's in the fucking toilet Why you 're gon na be stuck a Lt for life
That 's Franny She likes firemen

Oh these moments do try me
Stephen this is bullshit
He killed people
Just come down John Just
That was an accident Jesus Christ why did you have to go in there so fucking early Why did n't you listen to me
He 's alive
John when you 're in there in the fire do you ever see
My Lt might have something to say about that
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I thought I wo n't
Oh shut up huh I think I broke my goddamn arm
You crazy son of a bitch why could n't you stay behind a desk where you belong
You 're his Lt Stephen Are you gon na handle it Are you Stephen
We got ta go to Rimgale Stephen
What are we going to do about this
They were for the fucking boat Brian
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals Looking for me
I know
What are you doing here
I do n't know Brian I do n't know
Sometimes right when you 're looking at them
I hate him so much sometimes Stephen You do n't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on
I saw it before it got them I tried to yell but He asked me to look out for him And I did n't do it I let him die
When dad died I saw another fire
I saw it
It 's okay Stephen I
Look Stephen maybe we can talk about this some other
I really should get back There 's there 's something I 'm supposed to do
You 're selling dad 's boat
So hello
Hey what are you doing here
He did n't listen He was a fucking candidate He was your responsibility He should n't have been there in the first place Stephen You burned him
Had to take on another fire bare handed huh Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie Is that what happened Is it Stephen
Just leave me alone okay
Thanks for the insight
You said you wanted to know something Brian What did you learn today What do you say Brian huh Time to move on
That 's not what it 's about Brian The point is there was a kid in there And what if there 'd been two I went in because that 's what I do It 's my way It 's dad 's way It is n't everybody 's way
You okay
Christ Stephen let 's wait for the hose team
Roll the hose
You got a problem with drilling probie
What are you kidding By myself
Yeah too bright
Jesus it 's too damn bright in here Like a goddamn spotlight I 'm goin blind
Look Brian a photographer Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine too
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what
Hey
Thanks
C'mon ladies let 's roll some hose
I was doin it I was up there fucking doin it You do n't know man you do n't know what I did
Goddamn it Stephen
C'mon Stephen
Hook us up to a stand-pipe
Ya love it probie
I got ta do this Stephen I got ta know
Y'know I told myself a million times I did n't want to be a fireman I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy I know I split and I know how you felt
There 's only so much technology can do Thanks for the beer
So that 's it Big bad brother 's gon na ride my ass till I cough blood
Hey You do n't know me
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment I mean is this really gon na have to one of those big brother little brother you broke my GI Joe and I 'm still pissed games
That was never proved
Sheep do n't count
People actually used to pay you for this
It works
What you 've never seen one before
It 's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway Still good enough though for this tub
It 's comin along want a beer
Well see you 're wrong already Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald and we decided in the interest of brotherly love that maybe you should n't be way over on the other side of town So starting tomorrow your assigned to company 17 My company One case of scotch you 're getting cheap in your old age Brian
Does n't work on you See ya around little brother
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation Stephen It was a great inspiration to me
If you do it like that it 'll open in the fire Then you 'll get burned and DIE
It does n't go like that
I 'll see ya around huh
What 'll you do
I think your boss is going to need some spin control
That 's a dumb thing to say
Just take it
Your boss is lying Jennifer
Yes
You could check It 'd be in his files
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered I want to know why he keeps that hidden
Hi
You knew what we were asking you to do Do n't suddenly pull out a conscience now The fit is n't right
Oh yeah he 's the real fireman Who are you Just another probie working for Swayzak
Let me ask you something do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills Who the hell are you kidding I was there remember I saw you and your brother
I was doing my job
Will you please keep your voice down there 's people
I did n't know it was a secret There are n't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators
Brian What 's wrong
Well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment This area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose
Then why did you quit
Do you miss it You seem like you do
Homey
Oh there might be something stashed away for emergencies
Thanks for the invite
But Rimgale 's probably going to come around to arson
Yeah but it does n't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
Boy Rimgale 's as slow as a snail is n't he
Marty did But I wanted you to come to
You think that 's really any of your business
If you were n't at least the 300th person to ask me that I 'd probably be pissed Boy you sure know it 's a man 's world sometimes
Hi
I could use a date
Green committed to a thousand There 's another fund-raising party tonight Marty 'd really like you to come
How 's it going
Straightest answer your department 's given me all week
Yeah
I 've been thinking about what you said the other night If the offer 's still on the table I 'd like to talk about it
Look I did n't mean to take a piece out of you back there I just thought you 'd call when you came back You did n't and Do n't blow it just because of this garbage between us
Brian do you always have to be so stupid Think about your future for once
Boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that
Yeah well I like to think I 'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters
Bullshit Marty 's plan is only about efficiency I 've got two cousins on the job you think I 'd work for him if I did n't believe in it
Why do you think Marty came here tonight Because he cares about your department You do n't know how hard he works You do n't know about his programs helping West Side
Let me tell you something Martin Swayzak is going to be this town 's next mayor
Look I 'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night This is n't about fun I 'm working here
When I was twenty
I do n't want to be your friend Brian
What you think I just dried up and blew away when you left The world does turn once in awhile Brian even without your permission
I work for city hall
Not quite Just visiting I live in Lincoln Park now
Huh
Thanks for calling
You 're back
Brian
Oh Jesus Christ
Who the fuck is doing this
Trychticholorate
The outlets
I wanted to be him Right then I wanted to be him more than anything
I I thought it was great I loved it It was nothing to these guys medium deal
What
Sure you do
No no your turn Tell me a story
Your first question should be who is n't It is n't a spark Brian Not enough damage And an insurance pro Where 's the profit margin
Okay here 's the deal I 'll tell you a story you tell me one Fair
I 'm close but I ca n't get who it is
Brian McCaffrey Oh this is really a treat Brian McCaffrey Lost a dad to the animal huh
FITZGERALD Even if you graduate this academy you 've still got nine months of probation That 's hard duty son If you do n't really love this job it 'll kill you
FITZGERALD Sorry but it 's out of my hands Try again next year
FITZGERALD I do n't give a damn what your test scores were maybe you could have been a good firemen but you had your shot
FITZGERALD Look everybody remembers your old man Being his son all you had to do was breathe to graduate here Dead Hero Father Rule But you blew us off Why should I take you back
FITZGERALD You walked out on this academy six years ago One week to graduation You think we forgot that You think I did
Like it never happened
Yeah
I 've been lying here hours just thinking We 're close We 're not looking in the right place Brian This one knows us and we 're not looking in the right place
I hate hospitals You 're so so goddamn useless
No
Yeah
How ya feeling
It had to be someone who knows numbers Some kind of fancy accountant But what 's the connection
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report They did exactly one job Swayzak 's manpower study It 's not even really a company No employees no directors just a PO Box
Yeah Airtight
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces Swayzak 's up to his ass in this somehow Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand he 's so scared
And Cosgrove Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate They were n't very high on Seagrave either
Son of a bitch They knew each other
Fire
I 'm finished with Swayzak I 'll do whatever you want me to do I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim You got ta give me another shot
No Do that and I guarantee you 'll scare him off I do n't want him running away
No we have a stone killer trying to make a point
Why backdrafts Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out
But he could have killed everybody there The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall The backdraft blew out the flame That 's it That 's the reason
I got it after we talked to Ronald Torches Want to fry the whole goddamn world But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls And he made his burns backdrafts
That 's it Oh that son of a bitch he 's different goddamn it You see what this tells us huh Our killer does n't love fire
Some people say you do n't do much of anything when it comes to this case
But the right guess on this is arson
And the putty around the door
Trychticholorate Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder
Ever burned magnesium It 's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM
Go to the bottom Under heat properties
Read
Uh I do n't think that 's in my contract
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire
Glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion Lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn Explosion must of come after a slow burn You little tease What were you up to you little bastard huh What made you that mad Or scared It started in this room Took its time hung out but the air ran out It could n't breathe So it was snuffed But it was n't dead still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air
Glass
What are you listening to
Pest control
Look I knew your father he had a helluva reputation on this job But that do n't mean you get any slack Swayzak sends you down here okay I got ta eat you that 's the rules and I got nothing to say about that But Swayzak or no you live with me Step out of line and I do n't care who knows you I 'll swing the hammer You think you 're the first
Then go find a corner I do n't want you in my way
Are you still here
Uh I 'm Brian McCaffrey Your new assistant
Oh man I 'm sorry
Well that 's two things to strangle Stephen for Where is he anyway
Sean come on out man What you forget your favorite uncle
That 's Sean Jeez he 's a giant
Four months
'Bout written you off How long have you been in town
Hi Helen Man you look great
Yeah In fact I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday 's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office They loved it And you know what You were right my family background in firefighting gave it weight
It is n't mine Let 's get a picture
Mr McCaffrey
Yeah we got all kinds of traditions like dying young
I have a job
Every little boy 's fantasy
No you do n't understand I saved a mannequin
Uh I think there 's been a mistake I did n't save that woman
Yeah Big fan
There 's no replacement 'cause of your boss cuts if that 's what you mean If someone else goes out on an injury we 're really screwed
Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey on his very first fire showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father 's death
Ah man is he usin that line now on you What you think he made that little gem up Jesus Christ I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning
Could you believe that fire Man First day There I was Adcox and me pullin that lady right out of the fire 's fuckin throat I love it here No surround and drown for this company Fighting 17th Goddamn Stephen 's amazing You see how he took that fire by the balls I 'm gon na be that good some day you watch
Backdraft

You crooked son of a bitch Why 115
How 'd you know These are supposed to be sealed
Are n't you even curious
Completely out of control
I was ahead of my time
Coffee sucked

Yesterday morning God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him Not my arms or my legs but something I used for the first time for the last time and will never use again My vagina
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning and my sin You see Father
I also thought of that bread Father And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died and I kept the cool damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist Father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God
Father if it was so trivial so natural so No I have sinned And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition and to absolve me Father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God
Forgive me Father for I have sinned It has been two days since my last confession Father my sin is a terrible sin A sin of omission There was another sin that happened at the same time and in the same place but my sin I think was graver stil

Did we get our bill yet
My world famous famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon
No costume No blackface
Manray I 'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan Believe me it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her just lookin out for a brother I feel you all this stuff happenin at once but you ca n't let if affect your work You got ta be professional
How you sound
Mantan
You have to start getting into your character
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you do n't mind
You 're now Mantan
I would like to change your name
DeLa I 'm aboard As long as I get to hoof and get paid too
How different
Some tap dancing some singing
EUREKA
Well do something about it
Can I finish Thank you I had a great Aunt we called her Sister She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon
Do n't you people get it We 're in the 21st Century Slavery was over four hundred years ago All that stuff people talked in the old days it 's over Folks always crying white man this white man that Let 's all grow up
Yes And I say yes because who is to judge Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not Who Who can play God
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country Gary I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show it 's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist that 's when I get mad No one in any way shape or form should be censored
I want to meet her one day please tell her the great news I 'm OUT like Vanilla Ice
Hello Mommy let me get rid of this other call
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier From the gitgo from jump street
They did n't even view a rough cut just some scenes we quickly cut together
I seriously doubt that will ever happen Did n't I tell you I know your people better than you do But if by some miracle you 're correct I 'm gon na invite them inside my house and we 'll have a sit down discuss it like civil human beings
We just punched it up a bit Made it funnier
Calm down please
Dunwitty do n't leave
Derrick Coleman he possessed all the talent in the world coulda shoulda been a great ballplayer but alas D.C did n't want it bad enough Delacroix do you want it Bad enough to kill for it Do you want it that much
No Just meet the guy That 's all I 'm asking Look I 'll even let you choose your own musical director You can have that
If Spielburg can direct The Color Purple and Amistad our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot
Probably nuthin but that 's why it 's such a sexy way to go Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective A black director y'know what he 's gon na do given the subject matter With this kid the possibilities are endless
I just want you to meet him Keep an open mind
I want a hot young white director Maybe the kid that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right It 's un-American I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job
Sleep n Eat what do you do
That'swhatI'mtalkin bout That'swhatI'mtalkin bout He 's off the hiz-hook
I do n't know about that plantation angle
Ya first bad move Projects been done That 's one of the problems now everything movies TV are set in the urban jungle da hood That 's so tired Mantan 's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation In Alabama
We gon na hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis one What 's the setting
Who are the other characters
So what We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that No such thing as bad publicity So what Earlier you said singing and dancing
Let'em try I will kill to make this happen
This could be bigger than Amos and Andy
And Sleep n Eat is his comical sidekick
Exactly
What are there character traits
I want you take it there All the way to the edge and back
That 's a great handle
I do n't know if Whoopi is the way to go
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air In fact I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial
I 'm lovin it You know how I know Because I 'm getting a boner my Johnson is hard no disrespect my sister
The name of the show
Word
Go on Good so far
I 'm wid it
It 's right and tight Good morning let me introduce you to everybody You know my assistant Sloan
Yes Yes Yes I want a show that will make headlines that will have millions and millions of households tuned in glued to their televisions every week I want advertisers dying to buy on this show I 'm gon na squeeze this show out of you if it kills you
You will or you 'll be back at BET so quick you 'll never know what hit you I need a mid-season replacement and pronto It will be on the fast track
That 's exactly what I think I want you to create something that people want to see Let 's be honest the majority of the people in the country are deaf dumb and blind and I 'm including 35 million African-Americans You know and I know niggers set the trend set the styles This is a golden opportunity now These idiots have to be led to the water
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways Brother man I 'm blacker than you I 'm keepin it real and you 're frontin trying to be white
Delacroix wake up brother man The reason why they did n't get picked up was because nobody and I mean NOBODY niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son And so on and so forth It 's too clean too antiseptic
I do n't agree The Negro middle class does exist and it 's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom
NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER
I understand Black culture I grew up around black people all my life If the truth be told I probably know niggers better than you Monsieur Delacroix Please do n't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word I got a black wife and three bi-racial children so I feel I have a right to use that word I do n't give a damn what Spike says Tarantino is right Nigger is just a word If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I
I understand But again in all honesty I was not informed
C.P Time is Colored People 's Time The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late That Negroes have no sense of time time except when it comes to music or dance
I was n't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator
Four minutes ago
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone
exactly thirty-two minutes ago
I love you too Daddy
Let 's get him over to the bed
I did n't mean that in life
Where do you go from here
Nuthin I ca n't handle
The same old same old Trying to get my stuff through
All I know is what happened to me All that other mess I just file into the life 's too short category
That 's the only reason period They only want one certain kind of black comic
Because I had too much pride Too much integrity I would n't lick nobody 's butt Some material I refused to do
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell Virginny Is that what you 're asking ya Daddy
I did I 'm not an alcoholic I just like to drink
Purely for medicinal purposes
Daddy she 's younger than me
Pleased to meet you
It 's been a long time
It 's me Peerless
I want to speak with you
He did the best way he knew how Junebug is stubborn just like you
Your father is proud of you
I was a hostess at this club your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life He asked me to come with him I quit my job and we 've been together ever since
The drinking is for the pain It does n't kill it just dulls it
Not that often He was excited to see you
Is that so
Give me the gun
I did n't think this was in your studies at NYU
And that 's how you got me in the first place
Otherwise I trust you know the difference You 're an intelligent woman finished at NYU
The first and only time A big mistake I 'm gon na have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore
That 's why it will be so much fun
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody I know where I made my big mistake I have a general rule never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you
Light
Do you have to be so damn forthright
Dunwitty and I feel you 've been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
Oh is he You getting jiggy with Mantan
That crazy brother of yours does n't think so
How long have you and Hambone been hangin out
Why 'd you do that
How so
Is that good or bad
Thanks
The Jolly Nigger Bank
For what
What is this
So you have your small victory now what
What would their reaction be I had n't the foggiest
Who 's side are you on
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau 's I should not have imposed them on you
Same here
What do you want me to say
Let 's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
Break a leg
I 'm gon na slit my wrists Cut my throat For the love of Joseph
The big one
This is the group I was telling you about
Hello
Like I said all this for some twisted distorted sense of principal Dunwitty he just tolerates your Negroidal ass he does n't respect it
What 's the chances of MANTAN being picked up
Fuck da money Why do through all this effort Why Are you looking for love from Dunwitty For respect Dunwitty and his likes do n't give a goddamn about you So now what are you gon na do
Why did you even come up with that shit if you did n't want it made
What is your problem
You okay
Hello
Maybe something happened to them Maybe they 're lying in an alley bleed to death
Ca n't you just quit Walk away
I 'm in till the end
Sounds risky to me
What point is that
You lost me
Do you know how you will use him
The idea was out there in the universe Now what
It hit me like a ton of bricks
Manray
It was n't my fault If I would have known I would have known
Nobody told me anything
How was it
David I appreciate your comments Anybody got an ideas Everybody just talk out loud
Oh is that what I 'm doing
Hi Mona
Yes your name
My name is Manray goddamnit
Do I have to spell it out for you In fact go ask Sloan yourself
Let me ask you a question if I may How do you think she got the job in the first place I do n't mean to burst your bubble Mantan the Marvelous but Sloan is an opportunity
Oh is it Buddy boy in this business if people do n't produce they get fired
You should n't even be mad at me over Sloan
Yeah
Yo DeLa they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
No
In time
No joke Serious
Same thing Giuliani said
You sound like the media
Sloan will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready
I feel fine
Naw I 'll take the zero
The point I 'm trying to make is that this is a blessing It 's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way
That 's the way it came out Let me ask you one question Have you ever been in want in need your entire privileged life
Pressure DeLa you do n't know what the hell real pressure is SHEEETT This is lightstuff Now when you scramblin out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
Soon
If and when he calls please do n't forget to ask him if he 's seen Mantan
Not at all
Yes I have very hard Has Daddy called
You going to attack me too The show is a hit Are n't you happy for me
Peerless last time go see your father
Even more reason to see him He 'll be overjoyed with your success
Regardless he still is your father
Richmond is not all the way down south
He 's performing at some place outside of Richmond Virginia
Yes he did
He wants you to come and see him
Peerless your father called
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy get a number or something
To answer your question there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons
I know what 's on my birth certificate You heard from Daddy
Mommy please do n't call me that
It was It is But this is a different kind of show
Ca n't beat it with a hammer Well since you asked it looks like I may have a new show a pilot being shot
I said no such thing All I said is that something must be wrong
You hear me talkin to you The only time you come up here when something is wrong
You must think I 'm some kind of fool
Good luck Jukka Do a good show
Then will you teach me what I need to know Maybe we learn from each other if that 's possible no
My visual style is very erotic sexy how do you say hot
Thank you for correcting my ignorance I 'm looking forward to working side by side with you I feel we make a good team
Ahhh I never heard of that term before I thought you were BLACK of African-American No
A fiasco A disaster A boondoggle An abomination
Yes I know Jukka have you ever seen a Negro person before Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before
Finland
Where are you from
Nice to meet you If you do n't mind me asking you how old are you
Yes you
Let Myrna finish
The Mantan Manifesto Catchy ai n't it Number One We gainfully employ African Americans in front of and behind the cameras Two Let the audience decide Three Who put these critics in charge These so-called cultural police Four Who determines what is black Five Mantan is a satire Six If they ca n't take a joke F 'em
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings Through the roof But in this game you got ta be one two three steps ahead I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb She 's the best media consultant in the biz
I think that would probably make you the happiest When I 'm hoofing I mean really doing my thing hitting it nothing compares to that feeling in the world
You 're welcome You should n't give up on performing
I 'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with You look beautiful like that
Are you and him kicking it Knocking boots Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout
So what 's up with you and DeLa
You sing and dance
Not a class not a thing just picked stuff up by myself
I never had a really real pair before
I do n't know what a retort is but it 's simple Mantan The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL It 's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem This is America Our ancestors helped build this country we got a right just like everybody else I 'm not gon na box myself in This show makes people think and they 're laughing at the same time
No if you go with the flow Tavis That 's what a lot of Negroes do n't understand Protesting is n't gon na do a damn thing If people do n't like our satire in our number one hit show then do n't watch it Or better yet write your own show Do it better
Money makes the world go round It ai n't no joke being poor I know whatI'mtalkin bout Y'knowwhatI'msayin I 've lived on the street I 've been homeless I 've learned how to play the game work the game be in the game
Yo Tavis check it out This is the two-one the 21st century and it 's all about the money Like my man Mase says it 's all about the Benjamins
I 'm more comfortable around my people
Tavis thank you for having me

GENTLEMAN Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel
GENTLEMAN Where are you bound for
GENTLEMAN Good day to you young sir
BEST Ten sir and make them short ones do you hear Captain Grogan
You know the use of arms very well Best and no one can doubt your courage but Michael and I will see you home for all that
Both of us ride home with Best here
BEST And I 'll tell you what Mr Dugan I 've been insulted grossly in this house I ai n't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on I 'm an Englishman I am and a man of property and I I
Pooh Pooh Best you are joking
Well well What is it We 'll make you used to our ways or adopt English ones
Hoity-toity John Best what 's the matter here
And his baggage
Not yet but I believe he intends to
I am not sure The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
GALGENSTEIN I had thought you more expert You must find out if the Chevalier cheats He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house Find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole If you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself we look at them there But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys
GALGENSTEIN You are a Hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins He gambles a great deal and wins Do you know the cards well
What is the service sir
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police Herr Galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemen 's promotion
GALGENSTEIN Good morning Private James Please come in I should like you to meet my uncle Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein
GALGENSTEIN It 's a lie You 're a deserter You 're an impostor sir Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you do n't know Will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up
GALGENSTEIN I have acted as I think fit
GALGENSTEIN It was my joke I was tired and did not care to go farther There 's not prettier woman here than that If she wo n't suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
GALGENSTEIN The people are great farmers as well as inn-keepers
GALGENSTEIN Ah You sly rogue I see that will influence you
This may be a very good inn for Germany but it would not pass in old Ireland Corbach is only a league off let us push on for Corbach
GALGENSTEIN Oh yes of course Ambassador O'Grady
GALGENSTEIN What is your uncle 's name
GROGAN He has paid off your uncle 's mortgage He gave Dorothy a coach and-six That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle 's family Faith the business was well done Your cousins Michael and Harry never let him out of their sight though he was for deserting to England until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin Are you in want of cash my boy You may draw upon me for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and while they last you shall never want
GROGAN No the very same one my boy He recovered from his wound The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him It was only made of tow Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you But hit him you certainly did Roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to We told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
GROGAN She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband She is now Mrs John Best
GROGAN There 's only six Miss Dugans now poor Dorothy
GROGAN I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which I wanted of my family
GROGAN Look here Roderick my boy this is silly business The girl will marry Best mark my words and as sure as she does you 'll forget her You are but a boy Best is willing to consider you as such Dublin 's a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service Make Best an apology and be off
Not against Castle Dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
I 'll match any man with the sword
I hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully 's body
GROGAN And now you risk the same fate If you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
GROGAN That 's a very handsome sword you have there
My mare is saddled and ready who 's the captain 's second
Have you taken my message to him
He 'll give the better mark I am not afraid of him
Mark this come what will of it I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan I 'll follow him if it 's into the church and meet him there I 'll have his blood or he shall have mine Will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting
And so I am
GROGAN Faith I think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me do you mind that
O'REILLY Tut tut I can play at fencing as well as you Mr Roderick James Ah You change color do you Your secret is known is it You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis I take you to my tradesmen who give you credit I accept your note for near two hundred pounds and what do I find A fraud
O'REILLY You 're an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
O'REILLY Whom have I been harboring in my house Who are you sirrah
Ah I see No I 'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown
Which O'Higgins do you know For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship 's money and pearls
I have said all there is to be said I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish Good night
Chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it If you will be patient maybe I will pay you something another time
I do n't know
Chevalier though I can not say how I believe you have cheated me
I have no luggage
All Europe shall hear of this
Ten thousand But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
It is shameful infamous I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador 's house
Good gracious What is this
Where is my rascal Lazlo
Certain
To risk one 's life against such people is an imposition
Sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you
Then ordering fresh horses the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier
But how sir
But if they send you away then what is to become of me
I believe they will deport you
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
I can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
I 'd give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
Only the agency of servants
No one sir Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer
Yes sir
Yes sir Here is my letter
Take to your legs low Irish dog
Very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
Then you yield to me
Perfectly so and what is more I will tell you that I love her and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals
I entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady
Lady Cosgrove you are an old fool
My Lady Cosgrove 's relationship with me was a singular one Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me We would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes One day I was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth She suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me
As soon as I saw you loved me I was pleased and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part I would never love you But after our first kiss I found that I had no power over myself I did not know that one kiss could matter so much
Without you my dearest I might have died without ever knowing love Inexpressible love God of nature Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes
Shall I tell you something I believed what was called love came after the union and I was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead And so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me I was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
My husband has convinced me of the contrary
Our abstinence makes our love immortal If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago now I should love you even more But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
Always my dear one never any further Love is a child to be pacified with trifles A full diet can only kill it
I ask only a payment on account today after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
Yes but I am afraid of being deceived
Then I will respectfully take leave of her
With a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
To make me wretched in two weeks
You want my heart
How so
A man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
It is only too possible Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last
But if when I love I am unhappy I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
Your word empty makes me laugh Is it fortunate or unfortunate If it is fortunate I congratulate myself If it is unfortunate I do not care for I am not aware of it
Many worthy of attention but valuing is something more I could value only someone whom I loved
That man has perhaps not yet been born
Not one
Not even that
Never
No
Monster Your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop But I 'll have my revenge I will Roddy will you see me insulted
Well then I 'll tell you what I 'd do I 'd jump Daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
I 'd draw my sword and cut my way through them
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier and is famous as a man of fashion in London It is mighty well of you to fight farmers boys but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter
Oh I can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner Besides Roderick Captain Best 's a man and you are only a boy and you have n't a guinea in the world
I do n't care a fig for Captain Best he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man He looks well in his regimentals too and if he chose to ask me to dance how could I refuse him
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set
With pleasure at finding the ribbon
Then you must get it
Do you see the gate at the end of the field The first to touch it will be the winner
I accept but I insist on a wager The loser must do whatever the winner pleases
Last month the Duke of Suffolk spent no more
All the same you must name an amount
As much as possible
I am at your service Mr Cosgrove How much do you wish to spend
Yes
WEST Well sir this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty 's closet and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get
WEST Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus the thirteenth Earl of Crabs
What is to be done
When is he to go
The Prince left him only that choice
GALGENSTEIN Hmm-mmmm
GALGENSTEIN Was he cheated
GALGENSTEIN Does this assignment interest you
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies In every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality To the lady 's question about my birth and parentage I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune that I was going to Dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
As you have been robbed of your purse may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home
O'REILLY But I should n't like to put you to such trouble Mister
O'REILLY That fool did n't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me
Be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong Have you lost much
What has happened madam to annoy your ladyship
I see
Yes of course
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill Are you serious
I am prepared to accept the terms Mr Newcombe
Mr Newcombe I have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18 a year interest seems very stiff indeed
Brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away
Is he all right papa
Yes papa
What the devil What kind of fools do we have here Pottle who told the lad this story
Yes
Good night my little darling
Well we 'll just have to wait and see wo n't we
Now just have a little patience my boy Your birthday is n't until next week
WILLIAM I am sorry for you Mr James I 'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic What are the odds gentlemen that I do n't live to see Mr James hang yet
WILLIAM Not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps Why man I have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation Who knows how long I may keep you waiting
WILLIAM Is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as I am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor Is n't it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husband 's departure
WILLIAM He wants to step into my shoes He wants to step into my shoes
WILLIAM Gentlemen see this amiable youth He has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin Mr Hunt who has asked for advise from my wife Lady Cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple
WILLIAM Come come sir I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
WILLIAM Good evening Mr James have you done with my lady
WILLIAM Well why not a milkmaid 's daughter No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife 's sake on the contrary if he selects the animal properly he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure but a comfort in his hours of annoyance For instance I have got the gout who tends me A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power My wife never comes near me What friend have I None in the wide world Men of the world as you and I are do n't make friends and we are fools for our pains
WILLIAM In truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
WILLIAM Indeed you are right sir Look at me Marriage has added forty years to my life I am dying a worn-out cripple at the age of fifty When I took off Lady Cosgrove there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself Fool that I was I had enough with my pensions perfect freedom the best society in Europe and I gave up all these and married and was miserable Take a warning from me Mr Roderick and stick to the trumps Do anything but marry
I made Sir William Cosgrove 's acquaintance as usual at the play table One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him
He loves me as I love you
He is only curious to know who you are
Yes He brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
Dark Valdez
Charming Schuvaloff
Who
Yeah and I could 've used the sleep I 'm supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going
Do n't you mean do n't need no liquor license not taken away from me
Yeah if you 've slept
Can I at least have a drink
Do n't like 'em do n't eat 'em do n't make no damn difference to me
You framed-him
He is the only one unaccounted for
What about Pike
Did did you
I do n't want to go
What do we do
Just safety your shit and get behind me okay I 'll take care of this
A target Kendall cap a fucking target What 's wrong with you
Do n't you ever point a gun at me
West was one thing but this
Shut the fuck up you fucking faggot You just shut the FUCK UP
Before or after the explosion Mueller
We found him like this Kendall was with me the whole Listen to me
We found him like this
Can anybody hear me
We can still come out of this okay Pike got free he got a gun he came after us That 's the story
Shut up West 's dead
We found him like this
What do you mean alone
We do n't know West is dead
He 's telling the truth up to a point
I promised them I 'd ask you where West and the others are
And the bodies
Hunting we had to hunt him
He He made me do it
Not true Cadet I 've got a gun
Oh you do n't What else do you have on me You have n't found any bodies yet have you
You wan na bet
Mr Hardy I joined the army for college money I did n't ask for any of this I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed You say finding those bodies 'll help me then go find them I do n't want to die
But not Pike 's
They would have killed us both You want me to write a confession I 'll write a confession
Yeah
Of course
I apologize
I did n't shoot West
Did Kendall tell you about the PX
I 'm serious
He 's lying
That son of a bitch
No actually I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some
You smoke Ray
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
Some
I 'm not telling you what happened
Okay
They 're dead are n't they
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West Piece of work that guy I remember he used to have these two silver 45 's with ivory handles and if you were n't quick enough he 'd knock you on the head with one of them He still carry those guns
C'mon Ray everyone hates the Army during Basic I 'll tell you straight I hated it here
What do you like then
Well it 's a game of anticipation that 's the beauty
You 're under military arrest it 's not gon na happen What 's wrong with baseball
Why not
How do you know that
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record No You assumed who I was because I was wearing this uniform Do n't believe me
Is that what I did now And of course you can prove all of it
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too
Where 's the cabin
Why did n't you tell us all this in the first place
Mueller was alone in the cabin
One went off yeah but it did n't touch him I thought you knew this
The creek bed
Pills shots you name it Basic 's a lot easier when you do n't feel pain
No did he tell you about it About the business Childs ran
Yeah Spent half his time in the infirmary Only reason he enlisted was his father West did n't section him till last week
He was sickly Had that shaking thing whatd'yacall it epoxy
Tell us about the other guys the ones West weeded out
No ma'am he just wanted us to quit Making it through was kind of an honor Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight Command would consider you at the top of the class
Your weapons Sergeant
The rest of you fallout for physicals
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours He is not to be given food water or clothes If he so much as moves you are to blow his nigger brains out is that clear
You know how to work a pistol Dunbar
Cadet what 's your name
So you killed him
Pike and I got separated then I heard gunfire Close
Jesus what happened
Why
I hated West Childs hated West everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that does n't mean we killed him
He would n't kill anybody
A test will no doubt link you to the killing
No no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P 's
This is a lot of information to be getting I have to think
I I do n't know
They
That 's close range You go full auto on a guy from close range you 're gon na be swimming in blood Look at my uniform Nothing
From up close or far away
You saw West right How was he killed
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ai n't exactly something you want to broadcast Only Mueller and Childs know
Pull up my sleeve Right arm
Combat grade morphine Mueller sold it to me
Why
Bullshit
You hated West Mueller loved him
That 's exactly what he says about you
Oh come on
If not you then who
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper Were you watching your pack on the ride in
Maybe but that do n't make me a killer
You got ta untie me I did n't do this thing Ray
Right
You know it 's not like that
We just want to check your pack
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place It 's gettin bad out there Where 's West
I mean I killed him Is n't that what we all wanted
West 's Any kindling for afire
Maybe he
Maybe
I do n't know
But you ca n't prove it You ca n't prove anything until we find the bodies
Or you Levi When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
How do you know
Why
Jail if he 's lucky the gas chamber if he 's not
Something funny Levi
Dunbar will testify that you were
Well
Huh You know I really thought you said Nunez I thought you said Dunbar was gone My fault I got ta check the tape on that Oh yeah we taped the last interview This one too Cause it 'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie
Dunbar was running out the door Ohhhhhh See that 's where I was confused because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door
Why did you tell us he shot everybody Levi You put him in for three murders the man saved your life
Is it the truth
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
How many murders did you cover up One Five Maybe an even ten
Stop
Mr Hardy
I honestly do n't know Maybe to have someone to cover for him And I wish I could but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men
Right in front of us Mueller went after him but we held him back
No Poetic justice though
Maybe I should n't tell you that Maybe I should tell you I was n't scared at all But I was Enough to almost kill him
I did n't kill him
You said you wanted to know what happened I 'm telling you the truth
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled My father interceded so instead West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay
He is not shall we say wild about the idea He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and I have done my best to oblige him However in the last four weeks I began a relationship with another cadet What do you think of that
My father is a powerful man Over the years he 's used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain unpleasantries I am a homosexual
But not the only victim right
Levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to Washington and lock you in a very small dark room I suggest you talk to us
Coast Guard special detective detail We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk
Get your hands away from the desk
You ca n't duck this Bill I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I wo n't let this happen
No more witnesses West 's a ghost But it does n't matter because we have your signature the hospital log and Kendall 's toxicology report And that 'll be enough
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character The army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct There 's only one criminal standing in this room and it 's you
I 'm not even going to dignify that
I wanted to see if he was okay
That 's preposterous
West had a partner Someone who knew how to get things done
Stay where you are
You 're drunk
What are you talking about
I thought you said that was n't a compliment
Do n't be I 'm not cut out to deal with the West 's of the world
The Senator
I would n't know where to start I guess it was about one man framing another He thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings
Maybe But it 's my fault and I 'll carry it
It 's over Time of death was 4:42 JAG 's been notified and I called the Senator myself My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable you two had no culpability in the matter
Yeah
What I said before
What the hell are you talking about
What about the confession
Tom where are you going
You mean not enough to save you
Nevertheless what Kendall will testify and that 'll be enough
From Dunbar I hate to break this to you but I do n't think he 's gon na be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
Okay then let 's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car
There was a hurricane Bill the wind probably moved it
Someone must have got a shot off He was n't exactly a moving target
Pike killed West Dunbar killed Mueller Childs and Nunez
He 's not done by a longshot I can get more out of him
Tom bottom line I let those kids go out there If JAG shows up and I do n't have any answers for them my career is finished
The guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop
Cadet Roberto R Nunez Killed right in front of me
No the problem is one 's dead one 's got a bullet in his arm and one wo n't talk The one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up
The exercise was one of his Section Eight private sessions Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning
A few years ago the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder gentler military He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country
The official term for it is Clusterfuck By the time Beth hit us I 'd canceled all off base exercises save one a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush We 're missing three and the Sergeant The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names But the Sergeant
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
Would I have called you if it was n't If there was any other way
What kind of trouble are you in
How are you
He was your friend
Your phone number
I should probably write that down
Want company
Think it 'll work
Leaving without saying goodbye What are you gon na do
Yeah I can wait till you 're off the base and do it myself
Nobody saw But I do n't think so
Far as I 'm concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past
You 're a good man Hardy
That 's not true
What if I do n't want it
This is n't the time
What
We need to talk
No bodies no West
Hardy for Chrissakes
Is n't this how your story goes
Right back where we started
Get in
Good just making sure
Maybe Maybe we were nowhere near Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries I have n't by any chance grown on you have I
That 's gon na stay my secret
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority and all I did here was follow orders It did n't add up Plus I got kicked out
Nah
Now I go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
So did I
You wanted to break him
No I did n't I wanted to humiliate him For what he did to Dunbar For fucking over the little guy
Yeah I could 've Should 've
I pushed him too hard
That 's a fantastic idea
Why do n't you talk to Levi off the record for a second
Are you sure
What
We 're fucked I know
Little bit
So why after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house does the Senator 's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber
Buttfucks the cabin
So it 's a good plan but it goes wrong Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
Dunbar
Talk it through Childs Mueller and Nunez know they 're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it Kill West pin it on Pike
At least you and Kendall agree on that
What
Because it 's my job Because people are dead Because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that We can do this Hardy
But you will
I was starting to believe you you know That you were n't who everyone said I guess I was wrong
You did more than try You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator you 're phenomenal
You said you owed Styles and now you 're gon na turn your back on him
Goddammit Hardy you ca n't just leave
Styles could n't reassign him he 's a legend
Why the fuck was n't he in restraints
Look all we 've got is what Kendall says and he did n't actually witness any deaths except Nunez He found West he saw Mueller and Pike but just their bodies he did n't see any crime committed
I just He came back for Kendall I do n't think he 's capable of murder
I do n't think that has anything to do with
I lied Wait for it
Have no fear Osborne we have not yet begun to fight
Got it
Not the happiest of memories
Something wrong
He 's telling the truth up to a point
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
You 're off to a late start
You do understand that there 's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you right
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about is n't it
You 're kidding
Something like that You
Typical army brat story Dad was noncom Mom was a Nurse There was never any real doubt of joining up
What is that
We 're in the middle of a murder case
You really want to make banal chit chat like that now
You made me look like an idiot
Baseball
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez you 're a murderer
I questioned him for three hours and he did n't make a sound You do n't have a badge he wo n't talk to you
Good cop/bad cop
Is he handsome self assured carry himself well does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor does he have good bones suggesting good breeding does he slouch or sit up straight these are important questions as they reveal a great deal about this man 's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute
Is Dunbar cute
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which does n't exactly put people at ease Is he cute
Move him
He 's in interrogation
Christ Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone
Levi Who names their kid Levi
Three things First You do n't have a choice Second I 've never taken a bribe in my life And Third I 'm still a little drunk from last night so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you try not to take offense Tell me about the two guys
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside I 'm not comfortable having you involved in this
You 're the Tom Hardy I 've been reading about in the papers right New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres
You and the Colonel go back
And you notice I 'm not in the Army anymore
I did n't mean that as a compliment
You knew Sergeant West
Fantastic You want to tell me what 's going on
Although that wo n't matter much when coupled with the murder charge
Someone else can do the deed it does n't have to be you Maybe Nunez too he 's got a tendency to follow Mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their Sergeant 's killers We 'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West all we got ta do is tell the story right
Mueller He 's as bad as West and we both know it Now I ca n't do it cause I 'm tied up but we get the others to go along
A gay Senator 's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise The press 'll crucify you and your father His career will be over and it 'll be your fault But we do this different and you come out a hero
The thing is we 've got a real opportunity here You turn me in tomorrow and we 're both fucked
So you took off your shirt
I 'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly
I remember now it was before the explosion
Pike and I got separated
Poor fucker my ass
Oh yeah Excuse me Sergeant sir we do n't feel like going out we do n't want to get rained on He 'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland
You ever been in a hurricane Mueller
The faggot speaks
He came after us And I told Dunbar he had to kill him
So you framed him The same way Childs was going to frame Pike
I told him what had really happened to West Told him to keep quiet about it or I 'd destroy him Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam my father would be finished
Who Levi
Wrong answer
What
Enjoy your flight to Washington
It wo n't work
It does n't matter Levi We 're going to find those bodies and when we do I 'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon
You and Dunbar got your stories straight Little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you You think you 're just going to slide out of this You 're an accessory to murder Levi you 're going to jail
Dunbar says you were
Pike never confessed
Fifty minutes
We 've been making progress I see
Like I said I was in the kitchen When I came out Mueller and Pike were dead Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone
Because he 'd shot Mueller
He whispered it in my ear
You 're gon na die tonight faggot Clear as day
He wanted more than that
What The Truth Please There are degrees of truth officer always degrees Things are not what they seem
failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself
Shut up
Bullshit
The fuck are you talking about
We 're not going anywhere
Still got mine on not a speck of blood on it Not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours
Where 's your shirt Mueller
Shut the fuck up He was gon na cut him loose
What the fuck are you doing
Blame the nigger then huh Someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd
What the fuck happened to you One minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas
Toughens us up Pike You do n't like it quit
Ma'am Ray Dunbar 's black
You mean Ray Dunbar Well that ai n't right
Funny I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
Yeah
The army kicked you out for drugs
Gets on his plane in ten minutes which means you two are done You 'll understand if I do n't walk you out
I 'm giving you a chance to walk away
You both know if you do this if you go after a Senator 's son and you 're wrong it 's not just me in the hot seat anymore
You want Kendall do n't you
What do you think
You think he did it
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup If they 're hurt and we can get to them in time
He 's not Army it 's not official
But this guy you called he 's not even Army
This is totally unnecessary
CADETS Sir yes sir
So forget what you 've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder gentler military you will either succeed quit or die by my hand
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone as it would weaken the fabric of this nation 's defense This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me understand give me a sir yes sir
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit and those who refuse to quit I will kill You ever hear of a training accident give me a sir yes sir
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives You have chosen to join my Army This Army is my mother my father and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze do you understand me give me a sir yes sir
Thank you
There 's only one I want
That would explain the indigestion
Did n't kill anything did I
Sorry kid I do n't do charity
Kid you were a big fish in a small pond This here is the ocean and you 're drowning Take my advice and go back to Puddleville You 'll be happy there
I 've got a whole backpack full of clothes
What do you mean You do n't even know me
Who is she Where does she live
Yes
I 'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her That or die alone
I just saw the woman I 'm going to marry I know it But then I lost her
That 's great
It was on that night Karl met his destiny And I met mine Almost
I do n't expect to
No one 's ever left
Why

I 'll offer you more than it 's worth And you know you wo n't have to move Nothing will change except the name on the deed you have my word
Apparently I 've overlooked this one piece of it and I 'd like to remedy that You see in order for the town to be preserved the trust must own it in its entirety
How did you know
I promise Someday When I 'm really supposed to
I suspect it will hurt a lot
And when I 'm 38 you 'll be 48 And that 's not much difference at all
I 'm eight That means when I 'm eighteen you 'll be 28 And when I 'm 28 you 'll only be 38
How old are you
Yeah
Well she uh
Did you see that woman
I like your stories
You were talking about your wedding
Truth is I 've been thirsty my whole life Never really known why
Well we were all set to but there was a complication
Well it 's not a short one
Will never told you that Probably just as well He would have told it all wrong anyway All the facts and none of the flavor
That 's because we did n't have a wedding Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me She was engaged to somebody else
You do n't need a picture Just look up handsome in the dictionary
Spooning the sherbet
Stop
He was slipping her a little extra cream

Story of my life
The River
Where are we headed
Let 's get out of here
Like this
How I go
Tell me how it happens
The river
Yourself Good bad everything Just show me who you are for once
It would kill you huh
Only on the surface But that 's all I 've ever seen
You tell lies Dad You tell amusing lies Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime They 're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty And the thing is I believed you I believed your stories so much longer than I should have And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible everything I felt like such a fool to have trusted you You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined Just as charming and just as fake
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them The other 90 percent is below the water where you ca n't see it And that 's what it is with you Dad I 'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water
I 'm trying to make a metaphor here
Dad
Do you know much about icebergs Dad
Son
But the real story is how I got the car You see
The maple tree and the Buick We heard it
Did I ever tell you about how
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year
Why not religion Dad
I thought you were n't dying
You know where the chemicals are
Your mother has n't been keeping up the pool If you wanted to you could
You mean while I 'm here
You 're right
When did you ever work in an office
Really
What did he say
Okay
Surprise ending Would n't want to ruin it for you
I saw my death in that eye And this is not how it happens
She was a witch
Truly I saw it in The Eye
People need n't worry so much It 's not my time yet This is n't how I go
You think I 'm up for it
Did you do any of that
Am I
I 'm not scared
The one about the witch
Come on Will Everyone likes that story
Jesus Christ
What a father 's not allowed to talk about his son
You can see my predicament My wedding ring the symbol of fidelity to my wife soon to be the mother of my child was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish

Well therapy And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back I was living in a fairy tale
No it 's logical if you think like your father See to him there 's only two women your mother and everyone else
My father talked about a lot of things he never did and I 'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about I 'm just trying to reconcile the two
Because he 's dying
I 've seen him with women He flirts He always has On some level I presumed he was cheating on my mother I just never had proof
Were you and my father having an affair
How did you know my father
Are you Jenny Hill
Hello
I loved it It sounds peculiar but I loved every minute of it I did Eddie was travelling a lot so he was gone but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me A little part of his soul inside me I could feel it It was alive and kicking
Do you like it being pregnant
I 'm sorry It seems every hour I have to
I 'm going to check on him
I 'm going to get started on dishes
I spent a week in Morocco for the story It was incredible
Yes
Is he going to be okay
What happened
I need you on my side
Look I know why you like him I know why everyone likes him But I need you to tell me I 'm not crazy
But it 's not true
Do you love him
Do you love your father
Mmm what
But it 's romantic
What about the details How they fell in love The Circus The War You never told me any of that
You never told me how your parents met
I talked with your father last night
You do n't have to
Probably tonight
It 's more than they thought They 're going to stop chemo
Yes Thank you
That 's okay
I do n't suppose one of us could stay with him In case he In case he wakes up one of us should be there
So you never bought any land
Did you and Dad have any other property
Mom
Is he awake
That really happened
No But it 's weird She seemed to recognize me
Mom do you know who that is Blonde hair
Well clearly you do n't But I 'm not the mystery you 're trying to solve right now
I know it 's not easy Just remember he did n't choose to be your father and you did n't choose to be his son You just ended up together You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it 'd be just the same If you ask me it 's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all
Yes you both think William Bloom is a very smart man The problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someone 's wife And I 've been his wife longer than I 've been your mother You ca n't discount that
No it 's not It 's exactly the same Your father and I met we dated and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level Just the same as you two
Would you say you understand Josephine
How is that possible I mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly it 's another one of his stories You ca n't honestly say you know him
What I mean is do you really know what 's going on in his head
Mom would you say you understand Dad
I do n't know if you 've seen it but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek
How much time does he have left
How is he
Is that Dr Bennett 's car
We rented a car
We swam The Atlantic it 's not that big really
The sets were excellent Everything was big you know all the rubbish coke cans sweet wrappers dustbins so when you were watching it you felt cat size It was really clever
Yeah It was quite good actually Some bits I really liked
I paid for those guitar cases
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe Who paid When we went to see 'Cats Who paid
I 've been buying you stuff all week I 've been buying him stuff all week
No I do n't
What for
Fifty thousand Almost exactly
No I have n't
Leave him
What are you doing here
Name it
You heard what I said I 'm pregnant I 've been throwing up for weeks
Thank you
Yeah
It is I did it cooking
It 's nothing I burnt myself
We 'll stop then
Do you want to stop
What do you mean
There 's over eighty thousand here
Right
Hello
MANAGER You can see why it 's sensitive
MANAGER To customers approaching the bank from the rear
MANAGER This is sensitive Your car Lovely car Does n't necessarily give the right impression
I 'm so sorry
Oh Jesus Of course I ca n't
Oh Jesus
You do n't understand He wants all the money that is in your bank
He wants the money from your bank
He wants a lot of money
He wants money
He says you are very sad ridiculous man I do n't agree of course And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute Nadia is a prostitute I 'm sorry
What What does he want
Put the fucking kettle down Tell Yuri tell him put it down or I 'm going to make him
Put the fucking kettle down
I have brought you trouble Maybe I should have come alone
I understand I 'm so sorry
Fine I thought you were leaving today
It 's very strange How many people are truly themselves with their love It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers There are no Marches Against Heartache no Ministries Against Loneliness no Concerts Against Disappointment We look away And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us The one thing we all share but do n't say Look John I will show you something
Do you believe in love
You are not ashamed of it It 's no surprise to want to love
Tell me what he said
Tell me
What was that
Binoculars
I
When
She says she has a secret to tell
Uh Do you like England
No no
You must have a visa or something
So how long will you be in England
I asked her if you were happy to see us I find it hard to tell with you
So I come to England with other actors to make shows I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are
Right So I can say he smokes me So
I am actor he is actor although he is an actor stroke musician I just noodle along I 'm not so good He makes me look like a retard He smokes me I do n't mean he smokes me
We better watch him He 's crazy
Of course not Alexei he 's is my problem
Toast first then we talk seriously I can see you are serious about us
And what You mean from the beginning Jesus Can I uh okay as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short Okay Nadia is my little cousin Except she 's not But we say cousin This is for you
Good
Oh We are Russian
He says he feels safe here
What
Sorry You 've lost me
You must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates
How 's that We ca n't drink our piss can we
My name 's Sophia
Hurry I 'll wait for you here
What does it mean
It 's a long way to go for a date
No What No I know
Why
It 's not mine either
Please
Whatever
Goodbye
You can probably buy them on the flight
Something else
Okay Goodbye
Please Why not
Whatever
No I think I better just go
It 's alright
What 's your name
I do n't know
Except for Small Eyes
Maybe I want to die Do n't you want me to die
I smoke more these days I smoke more when I 'm unhappy
I 'm trying to quit
Laugh it up
She 's alive
What
I 'm sorry
Did she leave you Come on It 's nothing to be ashamed of Who did she leave you for Your best friend Her boss A woman Did she leave you for a woman John
The thin the girl with small eyes The one in your cupboard
What happened between you and the blonde
Are you scared
Have you had any before
Do you know if it 's a boy or a girl
I do n't have nothing
You are pretty naive if you think it is
The rest of the world John it 's not all like St Albans
Fifteen You do n't know him He was very kind and strong
I was n't saying anything
What I I was n't saying
You know in Russia there 's no work for women It 's a different world
You are throwing me out
Excuse me
You do n't understand me
It was n't what I wanted
I got what I paid for
What
I think it 's my safest bet do n't you
Well it 's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman or alone for that matter makes me want to die
I do n't like sex I do n't think I 'll be having sex ever again
Some What does that mean
Sometimes which
So what Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you 're with him or what
Whereas Wet n Wild is an emotional journey Tied and Tethered It 's pretty moving huh Like Anna Karenina
What 's a moral orgasm John Tell me how it feels exactly
And who says what is wrong
And What are you saying
I do n't hate you
We 'll pretend it never happened
No
Shut up I 'm not listening
I do n't want to talk about it
Yeah I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too
Excuse me
Not the kids type then is he Not that broody You must be pretty miffed
Of course Of course Of course he does Of course Thank you Thanks
Oh Jesus
So uh
It 's none of your business
I do n't want to talk about him
I said I do n't have any
I do n't have any money
Yes
What
You do n't have to do this I can look after myself
I 'm going I am I 'm going to be sick
I 'm going to be sick Where 's the

You ca n't hurt me more than I 'm hurt already
So you 're just going to be vindictive
I know you just want to punish me
No I do n't
Well as it turns out I did
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
I 'm going to drink my coffee Then we 're going to the police station Where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison
That 's a relief It 's nice to know I 'm a regular guy
I do n't want to know
Unless Unless this is part of the routine You get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee
You do n't understand anything

Gal Matthew ai n't doin shit this just a story Look it I 've seen it in nature I 've seen it in men Ya got to change up your crop Cuz that seed ai n't gettin in Ya got ta cut this shit out Got no cause to be up under these fools ruttin on ya like you a bitch Like you somebody 's dog No woman who joins in union with Almighty God or man in the sanctity of marriage should degrade herself and bend to ANOTHER MAN 'S WILL
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God and understand the word of God Not enough for you to hear what I 'm sayin you got ta understand
Means ya healin So all this farmin make me think on Matthew Matthew 13 The parable of the sower Man toss seed on rock on the wayside some fell in thorns you know the story
Cuz once in a while soil need a change Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans That give off a lot of nitrate Change keeps it all growin and growin strong Sting a bit
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts That 's a group of farmers you know each season they 'd rotate the crop Know why it 's best to rotate em like that
Ca n't sit all day on that sofa Need to get your legs strong
I CA N'T

How You do n't know the place You do n't know the language Get on the plane
They 're blaming it on you Christ Conklin you did n't even tell me you lost the prisoner
It 's not your job
Why me

What
Why
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys detective
One guy do all the damage
Not in that company
This by this
Goodbye officer
Do you know where she is detective Do you know how to find her Even where to start We will find them
You had my help detective
Your plane leaves at six Two officers will escort you
Hey HEY I 'M TALKING TO YOU INSPECTOR
While you were hanging out at the visa office we found the son-of-a bitch

The young are eating the old something that usually does n't happen here
Why do n't you ask your chief detective
Do you know what this is
Work with me I want your best detective
We 're police officers

I do n't have to
If I say no
With these
You trust me
Why tell me this
The Feds would be onto you in a month
Yes Unlike our syndicates your criminals do n't understand the words 'honor and 'duty We ca n't afford not to deal with them
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us
I want him
Kobo I know He killed two of my partners One in New York one at the printing plant
Seven years work by the finest engraver Mass produced sequentially numbered The best there has ever been Mr Conklin
Then go get him
You underestimate the trap Mary
What 's the point
Where
Pris
I 'm sure glad you found us Sebastian What do you think Mary
If he wo n't cooperate
Well stocked
We 're not used to the big city Where we come from it 's not so easy to get lost
Ca n't thank you enough Mr Sebastian If you had n't come along
Also extraordinary things
I am
Put it this way Rolls Royces are made to last as least they were But I 'm afraid you 're a Ferrari A high strung racing car built to win not to last
Would n't obstruct replication but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you 're got a virus again but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you
We 've already tried it ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship The ship sinks
The facts of life I 'll be blunt To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system at least by men makers or not it fatal A coding sequence ca n't be revised once it 's established
I want more life fucker
Death
Had in mind something a little more radical
Can the maker repair what he makes
It 's not an easy thing to meet your maker
Here 's your check my boy Thank you
Oh
No you stay here with us Out last night together
Where are you going Sebastian
You 're our best and only friend
When do you deliver your project
Be better if I could talk to him in person But he 's not an easy man to get to
His company made us
Tyrell could help us Sebastian
Dr Tyrell
If we do n't find help soon Pris has n't got long to live
You could help us
Not only that but we have smiliar problems Accelerated decrepitude But we do n't want to die quite yet
We have a lot in common
Like what
Nexus 6
You 're androids
You 're just all so so different
Well actually
If it would n't be too much of a bother a little bite to eat would be
Well no not really There 's Mr Deetchum he 's the watchman he lives on the first floor
Okay but do n't kill him Save a little for everybody A masterpiece
Very good Pris Now show him why
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home How are things at home
Hello glad to meet you
Tomorrow he says
He 's not ready yet

Got it
Who
Yeah
Yeah
Look go home Get some rest Take an aspirin
I did n't like her
She was gon na get away
I was just about to have my dinner
Yeah
Industrial refuse
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model Check it out on the Voight-Kampff There 's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect If that 's the case everybody 's up shit creek
We 're using Esper a 231 that picked up Holden 's alarm Its guess is that all five are in the city
There was n't much left of him so we ca n't be sure But bio chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees Guess he found himself one
Five Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro field
Oh Day after tomorrow
When might that be
Well when do you get paid
It 's got ta be right for my customer
Number three
Next
Okay gim me a run-down on the three females
Never mind Do they have that knowledge
The umbrella
Not if it works
Yes
What about a summary then
Here 's something you might find interesting They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum However after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism would create its own emotional responses hate love fear anger envy
Okay but
How do I stop one
You start
You equipped for random questions
Machines can be helpful sometimes but they can also be a pain in the ass Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill I do n't mind a bum-steer once in a while it 's their personalities that usually get me Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image If that 's true whoever made Esper should have been shot
My birthday is April 10 2015 How long do I live
How old am I

Those cockroaches
Sorry do n't have the time
Prosit
My pleasure
Shot of vodka please
I 'll but you one What 'll you have
It 's okay Forget it
I know what they are Deck Look maybe they can pretend to feel but far as the raw hot emotions of the old heart no way
Love is just another name for sex Love is sexy and sex is lovely I do n't care what you call it an android ca n't have it
What 's that
Let 's hear it
Money
From what I hear you 're doing great Bryant tells me you 're going like a god damn one-man army Making a lot of money huh
Hey it 's okay I like to pee So how are you doing
Do n't make me laugh It makes me pee
I 'm great I mean I know I 'm not really great but I feel just great How you like my new suit
My job is here
Too old
Never been more sure of anything in my life
They 'll change the limit before I change my mind
Listen I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there
Nope
True
Huh huh
Yeah
Meaning you do n't run as fast as you used to
I did n't say that Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time
Nerves of steel
What shows
Book the good ones for where
That 's what we call in the trade audition free-for alls and most of it sucks Bit I do n't think that 's her
I did n't know if I wanted to handle her I already got a snake act But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones
Nothing She wanted to know about suck night
Who
This one looks familiar but I do n't know Naw There 's one came in today looks a little like this one but
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little What am I supposed to be looking for
I 'd like you to take a look at these pictures
Yes
And who do I go to about you
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress
You 'd be surprised what a guy 'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body
Sorry
Come on
The best
It 's a good job
It that mother real
What the fuck for
Are you for real
How do you mean 'exploited
I do n't know nothing about it
I 'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me
You know what I think
What difference will it make
No I do n't
Andies only simulate suffering if they 're programmed for it
Because it 's not
Nope Nobody could stand me that long
What 's a long time
You mean a woman
I never felt better
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid Part of your education
I do n't like the noise Just practice Practice makes perfect
Never mind the plug just go through the motions
I do n't like people snooping around my stuff
It appears to be dirty why do n't you get somebody
Have you ever cleaned your apartment
When was the last time you cleaned this place
Like
What
It was n't very good last night was it
That 's another thing I ca n't do
Did you cry when your father died
Yeah Sometimes
If they are smart they take naps
Not too good
I am Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out
Oh
Where is he
Who is this
You did
There 's a lot I have n't done with a man before
Sit
Do n't just stand there looking at me It 's not polite
They probably want to find out when they were made
I can imagine
Yeah
So I 'm a piece of equipment Use me
You use your equipment do n't you
Two of us might be more effective than one
There 's two reasons a man rejects help Either because he 's so good at what he does he does n't think he needs it or he 's so insecure he ca n't admit it
I 've already got more help than I need
Is there anything else
Last question You 're watching an old movie It shows a banquet in progress the guests are enjoying raw oysters
It would be my child
That would be murder Mr Deckard
I 'd never get an abortion
You show the picture to your husband He likes it and hangs it on the wall The girl is lying on a bearskin rug
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl
You 're watching T.V and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist
You have a little boy He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar
For the responsibility of your power Being a police bureaucrat you 've got more than your share
Are you apprehensive
It 's artificial
A humanoid robot is like any other machine it can be a benefit or a hazard If it 's a benefit it 's not our problem
I 'll see you in a minute
Bad
What 's up
You know where I been I been on vacation
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer an Esper 231 I believe and a photo over-lay packet is being produced
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground
How many questions does it usually take Mr Deckard
She did n't know
How many questions did it take
If she is the machine works
Sitting next to you
Like you said Mr Deckard a machine can be a hazard The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine is n't it
But in your profession that is a risk
Have you ever retired a human by mistake
May I ask a personal question
Yes
Please
Thanks

Yes
Yeah Let 's dig in
Well we 'll be going up in two years We 'll know then I 'm very hopeful
One who does n't glow in the dark
Oh that 's just a bunch of baloney We never believed that in my family
What did you wish for Adam
No kidding Who else would have done it
Get the presents and do the lights
Calvin
Hi honey
Oh Calvin I 'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps ca n't be kept
Nonsense People have no idea what the human mind is capable of Look at us
Not bad for a three and a half year old I 'd like to see the public school system match that I do n't care how terrific it is
Watch this
Very nice Unless it caved in too
Why
We looked all over for you What are you doing back here
Calvin
If I you know
And I was wondering if if I could have a
What shall we call him
No Calvin Babies cry
Honey
What
I told you I 've got everything
Would you like a tranquilizer
How could you This is just like home
Really
Hot Dr Pepper Your favorite
Burnt to a crisp I 've given you the most well-done cut
We have to be strong sweetheart If not for ourselves for the child
Hi honey Feeling better
To go up
Then after that it 's safe
To keep us from trying to leave After an atomic blast there 's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years
The locks
To you maybe
As long as we 've got that straight
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber when this baby comes you 're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers
But what if I go into labor That could happen any time
Days
How long will we have to stay down here
Oh much worse But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip You remember that
Cheese is particularly troublesome
Calvin I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes It 's not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates
You hear that
No They all do
It shuts off automatically
It 's time
I 'm sorry everyone but given this extraordinary turn of events I think it 's prudent that we cut the evening short I 'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself but in the meantime I 'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance
Well put it down and come in
For Pete 's sake Calvin We 've got guests
Stop it you two
Go home Adam Go to your hotel
So where is your roommate the model
Go home Cliff wherever that might be
Hey they 're Ralph Laurens And who 's this interesting looking fellow
Your stuff Let me see that
What are you doing here
Stop
Adam
Well we 've come a long way have n't we I want to go home
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop
An adult bookstore He was very excited about seeing it You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley
No No wait a minute We stopped at a porno store
We came back to the house
To get some frozen poultry
I do n't know I like to think so
Yeah That 's thinking
Millions upon millions upon millions The cards The stock The clothes The toothpaste The guy was on the level And you blew it A man walks into your life who is the kindest most polite honest trustworthy incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life And what do you do
I do n't know Everything 's so neat It 's all just so goddamn dear Damn
We 'll find him
Give it back to him
Fallout shelter
Oh Well you 're certainly welcome
What
I know I know You did the right thing
Coward
You 're goddamn right I am
Oh no Not Sophie No way Please do n't tell me that
What
Well I admit it I 'm glad to hear that
So now I suppose he 's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
Where did he get all that information
Well consider the source I do n't even know what a lady is
What
Or have perfect table manners
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
And I do n't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
In the first place I do n't fall in love with weirdos I 've only known for four or five days
Yeah I 'm not the one who 's in love with the guy
To bed
Yeah But who 's not a slut these days
Hey you 're the psychic Eve the psychic pimp You tell me
What 's it to you
We did not leave together
Uh..he might of
Right here Well you 're being so bossy I was n't sure
It 's not so much what you say but how you say it Women like men who are unpredictable
Adam I think for you we should go for sweet
Eve
For him It does n't work for the rest of us
Just be yourself
That water 's freezing
How 'bout it Eve Can he skate around your block
I think it works
What do you think Adam
Alright I will
Yeah Like Ralph Lauren
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing do n't you
Well that 's blunt
What 's that supposed to mean
Money is no object He 's got cards up the wazoo
Exactly You understand that do n't you You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that
Oh my God
I even guessed his hotel did n't I
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs
So Adam where on earth are you from
I knew you 'd like him
I 'll give it to ya no money down The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway
Buy it from me
I 'm selling this place I want out of this hell hole
I miss those nice flower-power kids How 'bout you
I ca n't tell the boys from the girls anymore
I 'm going to need two more banana splits and a cherry coke
I 'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting
Tower say again
I 've got secondaries of an engine fire and I 'll need to find a clear area to eject
Stand by One
Tower Wolf One I 've got a problem here

You want to dance

I like that idea that 's a real good idea
You look beautiful
I 'd rather not talk about it I 'll tell you about it sometime
Where to
Nothing really It 's good to see you
Just some fatherly advice
Okay
I should never had gotten you going on this Yes Jeffrey Friday 's on
You did n't tell him about me
Everything okay
Jeffrey are they important things Well forget me you have to tell him Jeffrey I mean it
Yes Is that so surprising Yeah I worry a lot I got you into this
Yeah you 're a mystery I like you Very much
I 'm seeing something that was always hidden I 'm involved in a mystery I 'm learning And it 's all secret
Yeah
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man 's place
Number two I saw the Yellow Man come out This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance Number three Now get this In the distance was a murder A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken
Maybe But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs I think Frank supplies him
Number one I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank 's building laughing with Frank Now the only trouble is what does this prove
That 's what makes it so good You wanta hear what I saw today
Yeah but I do n't think it 's going to do much good Let 's go I 'll try to talk to him later
What am I going to do
You were late
Goodnight
You better not Jeffrey
Okay Sandy
I will I 'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five okay
I guess so You want to help me watch Frank I 'm going to stake out Frank 's place tomorrow with a camera
Yeah I guess so You 're a neat girl
Why are there people like Frank Why is there so much trouble in this world
That 's what I thought
That does n't bother you does it
Yeah I mean a little you know
Yes
Actually I 've been in twice
I do n't see how I can and I ca n't prove any of this I got all this information illegally Also it could get you in trouble
OK It 's a strange world Sandy This is what I have found out What I think I have found out Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don They have a son I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don 's ears I think he is holding them to make her do things for him I think she wants to die The ears were for her a warning to stay alive There is another man involved I call him the yellow man You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door I do n't know what he does but I think he 's on drugs supplied by Frank Frank is a very dangerous man
No way I 'm about to blow up
It 's okay Do n't worry about it
He got a little jealous
Well Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else you know what I mean
Well I 've found out some things nothing really for certain There are some strange people involved
Okay okay Bye
I do n't know if you 're a detective or a pervert
I 'll honk four times so you 'll hear it and know she 's on her way up Okay
I 'm going to wait here until she comes
Call tomorrow It 's okay Good luck I hope you can sneak out okay You 're going to wait until she 's asleep
Okay yeah call
I I do n't want to see you tomorrow Mike 's coming over
I wish you would n't do this It does n't make any sense Let 's go somewhere and have some coffee
OK
Yeah but
It 's crazy and dangerous My God I should n't have told you
Jeffrey I do n't think you ought to do it
Here 's to An interesting experience
That sounds good
Then we 'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there
First of all we 're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens We 'll watch her for awhile I 'd like to hear her sing anyway and then also we 'll know she is there and not in her apartment
Okay You better get out before someone sees us
Great I 'll pick you up around eight o'clock Is that good
First of all we 'll have a nice dinner Try to find out where Dorothy sings
I do n't want you to get involved really I mean I do but if something went wrong I mean like you said they may be involved in murder
Well it 's Friday night and you 're a beautiful girl I guess you would have a date that does that
You did n't goof it up but you still owe me one I want to sneak in tonight It 's Friday do you have a date tonight
Pretty clever Are you game for more
Yeah
I did n't get a good look at him either but he sure looked at me I did n't have time to get a window but I found this key Pretty nifty huh
Yes and no Did you recognize him
Yeah let 's get outta here What happened
Alright Good luck yourself
Oh brother Dorothy Vallens Seventh Floor Look on the mailbox for her number bright boy
Let 's go
Now we 'll walk over so there 's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes I can stall if it 's more but I need time to find a good window alright
Let 's just try the first part If that goes well we 'll see about the rest No one will suspect us because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this
You will be a Jehovah 's Witness I have a few Awake magazines for you You do n't have to keep her very long A few seconds is all I 'll need Whatiya think
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man I will spray her apartment After a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window
Alright the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later
Settle down I have a plan which I think will work There is very little for you to do but I do need your help Are n't you curious about my plan
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience Sometimes in some cases it 's necessary to take a risk I got to thinking I 'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman 's apartment you know sneak in and hide and observe
Ooooo you are smart Just do n't get too smart
I 'm here are n't I
Just a minute pull over and wait a minute
I do n't know
Yeah Good bye
I guess I 'll see you sometime
I 've got ta go in
What happened to him
Still it must be kinda rough
Yeah I guess so What are you going to do now that you 're home
My father is watching the businessman The businessman had a partner who disappeared Left his whole business and family his wife and two kids They think he 's been murdered
I do n't know like I said she 's not my father 's case
I do n't know you 're not supposed to see them They 're supposed to see you
That 's the building She lives on the Seventh Floor Do n't stop to look long the police are watching
I guess you have to get back home soon
It 's a strange world is n't it Do you know what building the woman lives in
The ear is from a missing person maybe

Do you know where that term comes from In the early 1900 's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb
Rule of thumb
Okay then let 's get ya started
Friends Gentlemen They were friends
The shooter knew these guys huh
And it 's the same story over here Why the crossover Theories
Maybe the three of them had something in common
Only two did the shooting So what are you thinking Russian retaliation
Of course they were How many
Can she I.D them
That depends You either do your job or get ethical
Fan-fuckin-tastic
And number three Dolly
Holy shit You 're the first one that 's ever got that
It was It was
Pee Per Man
My my
You killed my my
You oh god why
Where 's my cat
Rocco
Fucking figures Look are you guys seeing the pattern here We got big questions at both of these crime scenes with no answers WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths WHY did he do the bartender It would seem unnecessary even stupid God I hate cold crime scenes I 'm fucking leaving now And do me a favor tell me when the next guy dies cause these guys are not done yet
Duffy This look like a fucking post office to you This guy came in here with intent Maybe he did n't know exactly what he was gon na do but he had a pretty good idea The bartender was n't a fucking accident
These two fucking scenes are related Too many coincidences Same day Five hours apart Dead mobsters on both scenes Now why did he kill the bartender
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight Fled the scene Do n't have much on him
Jesus I just ca n't think anymore That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out
No way they could have seen it
And is there an American shit is there a man seated among us that has n't thought about it many times let 's just put them all on an island give them guns and let them kill each other This is our wet dream come true You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law then bury it from here on out
Now what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you
What about one guy with two guns
Excellent Number two Greenly
The two bullets went in here through the top of the skull criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs This one clue tells us three distinct facts Number one Duffy
The Greeks The Italians
That 's a possibility Y'know you Boston cops are perking up That 's two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally sized men Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent
And the pennies
Well Freud was right So you think they came for the fag man huh And what do you base this upon
The what man
So Duffy got any theories to go with that tie
So what are you thinkin here
What if it was just one guy with six guns
A couple of peons for the mob and
They were n't related The guy used a 38 No pennies Totally amateur
Witness
It tells us that he was the last to die All these men Were carrying They came in dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man Did n't they Duffy They sure as fuck did
Shit Shit
Eight
Respect is earned Greenly never given Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table
He 's struck again has n't he Greenly
Chief what the fuck is this
Who the
Brilliant So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory Top fucking notch What 's your name
We promise
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that He 's got ta learn ta respect women the way Connor does
Just called ta torture us did ya
Okay seriously both you listen ta me now
I
I got it ta my head now I got it ta my head now
You 'll make it outta here You ca n't ever stop not ever
We have to go now We 're on the lamb
Well I 'd say that makes him a lia fuckin-bility
I mean he ai n't here

Well he sure as fuck knew you
Worst day of my life man

Who says that You could take credit on it
We 're like 7-Eleven We ai n't always doing business but we 're always open
So you 're not just talkin mob guys You 're talkin anyone right Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit
This is some heavy shit This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man Fuck it There 's so much shit that pisses me off You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin tired of walkin down the street waitin for one of these assholes to get me y'know
Right now
Forgive me father
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man
Do you think they would harm an innocent man for any reason
You know them personally
Then you must find out what your beliefs are
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion It is harder to take small hints from God your feelings and listen to them to take a stand
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here
You feel A soul is what gives you feelings Happiness guilt right or wrong It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today You feel these men are necessary The Lord has spoken to you twice this day
You feel
You believe
God 's permission God does n't
What is it my son
Why have you come to a church for council if you 're not religious
Hello You there
I would n't have uh killed you Father Dominus Ominus Remember you 're bound You ca n't talk about this to anyone
Just be natural goddamit
Do your thing Father Do n't fuck this up
Father I 'll do you right here
Have you no fear of God
Do n't do this my son
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I did n't see
Yes
He says What 's your third wish And the guys says I-I want you to beat me half to death
Yeah And uh he 's pissed off He says Why you crackers always got ta find my mother fuckin pot And he tells him he 's gon na grant all his three wishes but he 's gon na give all the black guys

Right Freezers Imported foods
You 'll meet him this afternoon He 's helping us set it up
Mr Henry has an inside source We call him Steve That 's where we get our information
It 's big Anthony Real big It 's called Hinckley Cold Storage
I want you to look at this
Applejack would of got him anyway This was just the quicker way
That 's Applejack You want to meet him
Ah Couple days ago
What are you going to do get married Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats And go around scrubbing the
You 're in love with the fucking housekeeper
That 's what she is
A 500 tip For the housekeeper
You gave 383 to the goddamn housekeeper What the fuck is your problem
How much
Where 's the rest
Sixteen dollars
We 've got sixteen dollars
Our money situation is not good
I 'm not But there 's
I think we better go home
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted
You do n't know how to hotwire
Dignan I ca n't do that All right I just ca n't
Shh
I do n't know Dignan I just
What I 'm saying is she would n't go for that
I do n't think we can do that
What
We need a car
Man I 'm sorry We just went for a walk
I wish I 'd been there
I ca n't believe he just jumped you
Why do n't you come with us
We 're going over to this bar if you feel like going
I did n't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself Dignan
If you say so
Bob went to help his brother I understand that and I ca n't help it if you do n't
Well I did n't do it did I
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go
You were asleep
This morning
That 's a long time to be in jail
He went back for his brother
Maybe he just went to the store
Right here
He 's gone He stole the car
But if it was n't for Dignan I probably would of died
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan 's again
This was in fourth grade
Do n't worry about it Bob
Bob
As long as he gets out OK
No no Look OK Let 's stay here until we find out what 's going on
No kidding
On the left
No Not really Inez speaks a little
No I did n't Dignan they do n't speak English
What What 's the matter
Sure
Jerry And this is my associate Cornelius
Hi
No We did n't
Even if it 's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not
Then you 're going to have to dye it Anthony We 've got to hide our identities Especially after Bob crashed the car
True
Actually If you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over
Right Get back to me on that one Once your plan is worth a shit
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal Anthony
No I 'm not saying her I 'm just saying I do n't know
Bob
On your marks Get set go
I 'll say it
You were spoiled rotten
That 's real cool Anthony Yeah I wore boots My parents would n't buy me any 200 running shoes like yours I was n't spoiled
Really OK Dad But seriously Anthony These are fast shoes
They obviously were n't designed for racing
Look at the treads on those
Dignan those are n't running shoes
Anthony we 're on the run This is an emergency It 's only fair that
Well then cut it in half
She 's not going to notice Anthony
Why not
Can I get that credit card from you
I did n't realize you were so sensitive to Bob 's feelings Considering I did the plans you 're actually lucky you got
Anthony he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress He got what he deserved
What 's wrong with him
Like he would find Dignan One day
Like he meant it
Oh shit That was scary In the middle of the robbery The manager looks at me Right in the eye And goes I 'm going to remember you
We got it We got it
Unlock that door Check the aisles
We know there 's another stocker
Where 's the other stocker
You 're right You 're right
Dignan Stop
Dignan calm down
Anthony give me the fucking gun
Now One thing we need to discuss is timing Timing is absolutely crucial What are you doing Anthony
You think we 're going to be chased
Just turn right here
Yeah
Hang on a second
That 's not bad
Holy shit What 'd I tell you
Yeah I heard that
No just do it real quick I 'll meet you down there
I do n't think so Just reach on in
I 'm lookout
Did you see that
You 're making fun of my family You know there 's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig You know exactly what you 're saying
I do n't appreciate you ridiculing me
Then you should n't of gone in there Dignan Maybe we should of robbed your house Did you ever think of that
That does n't make any difference I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday They have a very special value for her
The list Dignan I know you remember the list because you signed it Things Dignan was not supposed to touch
But Dignan do you really know that much about rare coins
What do you think the cops have
She 's an attractive older woman
See your mind is very good with the more mechanical details Whereas my strength would be
Who knows That 's why I filed it down
That 's true But what if they change the locks
Did you see what I meant about the window
This is he
What does Starsky say
See that 's what I 'm saying It has the logic of a dream
Why
I think you might of dreamed this one Anthony
Plus where 's Huggie Bear
OK That 's wrong
Making Hutch David Soul
What color hair does he have
Why 'd you want to help us
Can I ask you something Mr Henry
HENRY It 's an esoteric journey
HENRY But you 're thieves It 's what you are
This is good
Are you afraid to die Mr Henry
No Bob did
Death
Yeah I mean I do n't think about it all the time But once in awhile I kind of go Woah Man
I do n't want to die
Me
That sounds like Dignan
How 'd he do
Did Dignan take the test
HENRY How does that feel
That was a test
What do you mean
HENRY Hold it
HENRY As far as I can tell he has n't thought his life through He 'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car But business You I can work with You I could groom Dignan 's not going to make it
HENRY Sure sure He 's a great person and I 'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here
HENRY I guess what I 'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan
HENRY Tell me something What the hell kind of name is Dignan
HENRY Look at that woman She 's what Fifty Fifty-five But she has n't let herself go I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body
You mean a safecracker
I 'd like to live in that place Hinckley Cold Storage
You mean like techniques
HENRY Every once in a while some cat comes to me He wants to know how I made it How did I become a success The first thing I tell them is follow your instincts Let your instincts guide you The second thing I tell them is for Christ 's sake you got to know your grammar
HENRY You know your form is for shit but you 've got a hell of a talent
It 's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle
HENRY That 's a sharp jacket
HENRY This is my business manager Rowboat
It 's in the driveway
We think Mr Henry maybe
Yeah
Jesus Bob
Let me see it Did you drop it
What are you doing
No I know I 'm just saying I feel fine You want a piece of cake
No I 'm having a heart attack Of course I 'm OK What 's that supposed to mean
Hopscotch The code name is hopscotch
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail
It was stupid
Jesus Christ No
No I was n't adopted
Why do you say that
Yeah but he still has the aggravation Three days sitting in a cell
Prison tatoos I got to be pretty good It 's not like drawing on paper
Yeah One minute you 're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you 're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter That 's partly why I was in custody so long Sixty days
That 's pretty complicated for a senior prank
Well I did n't mean to electrocute him But the whole operation was my idea
No I do n't mind
Yes You just got to stick with it
You 've only been playing for two weeks Bob It takes a long time to learn this game
Why not
Bob where you going
What
Anthony I
How long are they going to hold him
You think he got my license plates
Will you guys shut up God It 's like having two little kids in the car
I do n't know I personally do n't need that shit in my life right now
Move
Phil probably provoked him Where 's he going
Oh yeah They 'll never catch the guy
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop He loves them
You 'll probably have them the rest of your life
See you
Are you serious
Let them fight
I do n't know Sure I guess
But he 's got a loud bark That 's the most important thing is a loud bark
It 's private property Plus I have Hector
Pot is an herb It 's just like any type of gardening
Yeah I 've stolen two cars before One Jaguar And one Trans-Am With T Tops That Trans-Am was fun to drive
Future Man You know Cause he looks like he 's from the future

Wait Did he see us
What 's he doing here
That 's your friend Anthony
Wait a second

That sounds like a lot of bullshit that 'll land us in jail
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car It does n't make any goddamn sense
The one and only Little Richard
Little Richard Trust me You 're insane Jesus this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets
Dignan and Anthony this is Little Richard He 's crazy Totally nuts

Dignan he 's my brother I ca n't just leave him there
Well obviously we got to go back
We 'll have to see when we get back
I do n't know
I was just going to use it to see how much I had
The cops say it 's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
They also found my two beam scale in the garage
Well the marijuana crop is a good start
They said he 's a drug dealer
The weed
My brother 's in jail
See you in a little while
You 're the one who kept saying ram him
It 's registered in my mother 's name
I do n't know
He would n't move
There were more than that
So it 's my fault
Way to go Bob
That 's true That would give me nightmares
I do n't want to talk about it
No All he 'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose
No I was calm
Do n't count it
Be cool Bob Be cool Make that light
That 's good Keep it at forty
Shhh Slow down Bob Drive natural
I 'm putting a piece of tape on my nose
You know when somebody gets electrocuted their skin starts smoking At least Swifty 's did
Yeah One of the nicest old guys you 'd ever know
It was an accidental I do n't want to go into the details It was just one of those senior pranks that did n't really go right I mean obviously since Swifty 's dead That 's why Anthony never graduated
You know Bob Anthony did kill someone He electrocuted our janitor senior year
Well in reality it 's not that dangerous Bob It 's only dangerous if you do n't know what you 're doing
God DAMMIT
I just want to see how much bullets it takes
I 'm paying attention I just want to look at it for a minute
OK
That 's my responsibility
I 'm going to take a look at this
I think we might of scared her
Where 'd she go
Well do n't blame me I told you
No I was saying crazy like a lunatic
I warned you Dignan
I told you he 's crazy
I ca n't believe you said that
Yeah but do n't tell anybody
Do n't you guys tell anybody about my plants
If it 's that easy why does n't everybody grow them
Six thousand dollars Come on Bob
How much could you grow Realistically
Well What do you want to do You want to steal one or just drive your car
OK Bob

MAN Right I 'm sorry You 've got a reputation to think about

MAN Nice to meet you
MAN Well we 'll see you later Bob
MAN What
HENRY Good to know you John
Bourne comes here Why
What
Go to the airport Get a plane I 'll have a brass band waiting for you
Leaving was a business decision We 're both rich come enjoy it
Neski was a roadblock Without me there 's no company no fortune You owe me Uri One last push
She 's done everything I wanted She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable She even found his bogus Swiss account
No The files are spotless Whatever they find it 's just going to make Conklin look worse
I 'll say You killed his goddam girlfriend instead Now they 're onto Neski They 're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak
You told me Bourne was dead
No You lost your way
No good options left
And Danny Zorn what was that
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it
'Why would be enough for me
I 'd rather stand if it 's all the same to you
I 'm sorry Ward
Do n't know
No It must have been Bourne
Oh God It must have been Bourne
What
Sorry to wake you
It 's hard to swallow The confusion the amnesia but he keeps on killing It 's more calculated than sick What about Nicky She 's the last one to see Bourne in Paris She 's the one he asks for They disappear
There are no answers There 's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead And I for one would prefer the latter And what about her You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection
My ass he does You 're playing with fire Pamela Marshall said nail him to the wall I do n't know how you interpreted that but I do n't think he meant repatriate him
Call a Mayday into Berlin station We need snipers DOD whatever they got Snipers
You do n't know what you 're getting into here
Berlin
What 's definitive is that I just lost two people in Berlin
May I finish
Excuse me
At the time of his death Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars
Ivan Mevedev senior financial manager worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies Pecos Oil He claimed to know where the money landed We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency This
Dead in a ditch Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu Who knows
I 've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency I 've shoveled shit on four continents I 'm due to retire next year and believe me I need my pension but if you think I 'm gon na sit here and let you dangle me with this you can go to hell Marshall too It had to be done
What happened Jason Bourne happened You 've got the files Then let 's cut the crap It went wrong Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap Bourne was his number one guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back Conklin could n't fix it could n't find Bourne could n't adjust It all went sideways Finally there were no options left
What are you after Pam You want to fry me You want my desk Is that it
He does I 've been down to the archives I have the files Ward
I want to know about Treadstone
With all due respect Pam I think you might 've wandered a little past your pay-grade
Never heard of it
Okay
Nobody You I had to tell you right
Including Landy She had access to the archives
Something 's been going on here in Europe And it 's still going on Post Conklin Who 's been in Berlin
Okay What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne What if Bourne did n't have anything to do with this
Is it a slam dunk No but
There were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously The second one the one that did n't go off was down here First of all this is nothing it 's a sub-line for the breaker above Second why put the charge all the way down here If you 're good enough to get in here and handle the gear you 're good enough to know you do n't need this Bourne would know
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it 's gon na take out power to the building You know that What you ca n't know is if it 's gon na blow the room with it
I did my box work but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense I mean I 'm with you on this Conklin was a nut but a traitor I just ca n't get there
She say what time I should call
Sir
Is this really happening
No Because you do n't want to know how it feels
I ca n't let you do that either
Look at me
You know I 'm not
It does n't matter Your life is hard enough
How how can how can you be here and say this
You killed them
I killed them
That 's not what happened to your parents
It changes things That knowledge Does n't it
I would want to know I would want to know that my mother did n't kill my father I would want to know that she did n't kill herself
No It 's because you do n't know how they died
It 's nice Does this picture mean anything to you Hmm
Of all the people in the world you 're the only one I have anything to offer That 's why I came here
Sit Can you The chair Have the chair
what
car keys
I 'm sorry
I did
I do n't know Why would I lie
I do n't know who that is
A voice A voice from the States Someone new
I do n't know
Shot dead in Paris Dead the night you walked out
He 's dead
What do you want
So why did n't you kill me then
You still should 've moved
Front Use your teeth
Felt a little light
Jason You know exactly what to do That is your mission now
I only dream about people who are dead
I know it 's a dream
It would n't have changed the way you feel
But you found another choice
Tell me later
There 's no choice
I warned them Marie I told them to leave us alone
If he crosses the bridge it is
I 'm going to bail on the other side and wait This bridge is the only way he can follow
You keep going to the shack I 'll meet you there in an hour
yeah one guy I do n't think he was ready
not yet
make the left toward the bridge
Switch You drive
You drive
where 's left to go
I do n't want to move again I like it here
but you 're not you 're not sure
Where
That 's crazy
So
But you 're sure
But we were so careful
No How
But it ends up the same
I should be better by now
I do n't mean that I worry when you try to ignore it
I worry when you get like this
I do remember something good All the time I remember you
it 's always bad and it 's never anything but bits and pieces anyway You ever think that maybe it 's just making it worse You do n't wonder that
Two years we 're scribbling in a notebook
No There 's nothing new
Conklin up front
it 's not in the file I swear I know your file your first job was Geneva I swear to God you never worked here
No Jason please
That 's a lie
My first job
For Treadstone In Berlin You know my file I did a job here When
So when was I here
Abbott
Why are you here then
What was Landy buying What kind of files WHAT WAS SHE BUYING
You left a print There was Kel that did n't go off There was a partial print they tracked it back to Treadstone They know it 's you
And you got to him before we could
It was Pamela Landy 's op The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something I have n't been debriefed on exactly what it was
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national
I want to hear it from you
How do they know that How can they know any of that
Why is she trying to kill me
You hear me I believed you
I did Jason I swear I did I told them I told them I believed you
Yes
Why you 're alive You 're alive because you 're special Because she kept you alive Because we want you back on our side
Sounds like a threat
Do you think you can read Are you well enough
Thank you for your gift I 'm sorry about Marie
Why am I alive
Oh shit
Where am I
Okay Jason your move
Who
Okay how do you want to do it
What do you want
It 's me
What The tapes
But we can relax We tracked him He 's on a train to Moscow
This stays between you and I We finally have an edge I do n't want to lose it
Alright take it down
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night
go take the van
Kurt 's reopening all the wyfi and sat links
There 's only a Consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago
Looks like he 's been detained
so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines One of them failed The fingerprint That 's from the one that did n't go off
We need to get in there
no not me no other people
Is there Is all there
Now Show now
Show me
Okay cut to the chase Pam What are you selling
Still
It 's a lot of money Pam
I 'm here So is Donnie and Jack Weller We understand you 're using the full allocation for this buy
Yes sir ma'am
If you ever want to make it to five you 're gon na listen to me real close Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous A week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer
How long have you worked for the agency
Who 's this
Felt promising It 's a start
Let 's give him half an hour
I do n't know He was sick He wanted out I believed him
It 's got caffeine in it That 's all I know
Because he 's doing just what he said he 'd do He 's coming for us
I do n't think we need to keep looking for him anyway
What do you want from me I was reassigned I 'm out
These were killers Conklin had them all jacked up They were Dobermans
You mean did I want a date
You 're making it out like we 're friends here or something I met him alone twice
If you say so
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown
Look what do you want me to say I was there I believed him
Am I a doctor no but
You were his local contact You were with him the night Conklin died You 're coming with us
Before this Before Bourne No
Depression Anger Compulsive behaviors They had physical symptoms headaches sensitivity to light
And what about you anything
Are we hacking or asking
Alright I want you Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne track everything that 's out there
By who
Yeah that 'll work What the hell was he doing here
Are we locked up
Anything
Yup The main word there the file heading translates as Treadstone
They 've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God 's church and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation So please do it
My brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over
We just had a funeral is n't that what it means in England as well
Saying goodbye in their own way in outlawed tartans with outlawed pipes playing outlawed tunes
Non loquis Latinum You do n't speak Latin We have to fix that wo n't we Did he give the poetic benediction The Lord bless thee and keep thee Patris Benefactum et It was Malcolm 's favorite
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection Or was it all about Judgment
I do n't want to leave
He has already agreed to come
We can not Some scarcely believe you are alive Other think you 'll pay them Mornay 's wages We bid you to Edinburgh Meet us at the city gates two days from now at sunset Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you Scotland will be one
An oath to a liar is no oath at all An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you
Sir William We come to seek a meeting
With cavalry not heavy like the English but light fast horsemen like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen
Peace
A thousand You have made me Guardian of Scotland So I tell you this is what we face
I will invade England And defeat the English on their own ground
You are surprised he would lie Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday You are Longshanks new designate You will be king
He will I know he will
That is another matter There is a price to all this required both by Longshanks and our nobles Pay it and you will be our king And we will have peace
Homage is nothing It is the crown that matters
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone and his crowns divided for others to wear
May he rest in peace You have already sealed the coffin
Does anyone know his politics
A wise plan And how is your father We have missed him at the council
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes
You let Wallace escape your whole army You can not blame me for this
He is gone Finished Dead If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him he will not survive the winter It is very cold is it not our flower
What choice do they have Now they must serve us or starve
Now we kill two birds at one stroke We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself
Wallace has sacked York
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost our entire northern army wiped out And you have done nothing
What news of the north
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms
Nor you To you that word is as unfamiliar as love
You fancy him
Wallace 's For treason there is no trial Tomorrow he will be charged then executed
Simply because he eluded your trap do you think he is more than a man My father is dying Perhaps you should think of our coronation
Grant as you do everything else with treachery Offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary He trusts me Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along And I will set the meeting and the ambush
Wallace himself If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town I leave you to your hauntings If you wish to take him I know a way
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion
Good day to you M'Lords
Yes I had thought that I was loathsome to you Perhaps I am If I may be excused M'lord
Look at me I said LOOK AT ME
All so very boring He wants me to learn to fight too so let me do it
Shut up would you How can I concentrate
So I did And what was so important about it
What is it
Keep these We 're going too
Your dreams are n't about freedom They 're about Marion You have to be a hero because you think she sees you Is that it
That 's just a dream William
I do n't want to be a martyr
You know it 's a trap
I rest
We 're here to stay We do n't care to live if we ca n't fight beside ya
Aye
Mornay has come So will the Bruce
Fourteen
Hamish I thank
I should a remembered the eggs
I will not
I could crush you like a roach
That depends on the man
The test of a soldier is not in his arm It 's here
You win
Aye we 'll get 'em
I wan na have supper waitin
It 's up to us Hamish
They 're English soldiers ai n't they
Three maybe more
They 're coming
We do n't split up
A patriot
Excellent Stephen is my name I 'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle Except I 'm not on the Emerald Isle of course more 's the pity
Is your Poppa a ghost or do you converse with God Almighty
All men lose heart All betray It is exactly why we must make the choices we make
We must have alliance with England to prevail here You achieved that You saved your family increased your lands In time you will have all the power in Scotland Yet you grieve
So more men were slaughtered uselessly
I am the one who is rotting But I think your face looks graver than mine
Let her speak
My greatness is better demonstrated with this
This is what happens when you must send a woman And a fool
Humbly M'lord
A mindless barbarian Not a king like you M'lord
He waits For you He says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him
No He did not
If he wants his queen to rule then you stay and learn how I will deal with him
I sent for him and the little coward send you
Where is my son
I do not confess
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times I can not commit treason if I have never been his subject
Never in my whole life did I swear allegiance to your king
Treason Against whom
Then when
Tonight then
I 've missed you
This night is too beautiful to have again
You scare me
Nor I
I accept your proposal
No You do n't choose your dreams Your dreams choose you
Some nights I have dreams Mostly dreams I do n't want I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I 'd dream only of the ride and the adventure
You are And I 'll come again
Thank you for inviting
It 's not you He dislikes that you 're a Wallace He just says the Wallaces do n't seem to live for very long
Wake up William Wake up
And I with you But you must wake
Yes you are And you must wake
I would n't know
A magistrate wished to capture him and found he had a secret lover so he cut the girl 's throat to tempt Wallace to fight and fight he did
Ah Oui Englishmen do n't know what a tongue is for
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes Scotland is in chaos Your husband is secretly sending an army north
It will numb my wits and I must have them all If I 'm senseless or if I wail then Longshanks will have broken me
Every man dies Not every man really lives
If I swear to him then everything I am is dead already
Will he show mercy to my country Will he take back his soldiers and let us rule ourselves
M'lady what kindness of you to visit a stranger
I can not love you for the sake of revenge
I have taken vows More than one I 've vowed faithfulness to my husband and sworn to give him a son And I can not keep both promises
Because of the way you 're looking at me now The same way as when we met
It does me good to see you
She was my wife We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord They killed her to get to me And she was pregnant
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS
A Lordship And gold That I should become Judas
That is not possible
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities The executioner of the king 's nephew my husband 's own cousin
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight
It 's battle I want not talk
Wife of Edward the king 's son
And I will consult with mine
Then tell me what a king is Is he a man who believes only what others believe Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart There is strength in you I see it I know it
War finds me willing I know it wo n't bring back all I have lost But it can bring what none of us have ever had a country of our own For that we need a king We need you
I 'm no coward I want what you want But we need the nobles
No But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other If you make enemies on both sides of the border you 'll end up dead
Wait I respect what you said But remember these men have lands castles Much to risk
Come it 'll help you sleep
Fine speech Now what do we do
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger
Who would do such a thing
What 's the crazy man saying Lord
We ca n't stop
What
Thank you for showing it to me first I 'll I 'll take care of it Can I have the picture
What is it
I 'm sorry but can it wait til tonight I 'm already late for work
REDFIELD The hemorrhaging the neural damage is irreparable I 'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
So what did you find
REDFIELD Nine ten And you 're awake Open your eyes dammit
How soon
Well he has been pushing me to meet his father but I 've been putting it off
Come on I doubt the answer 's that simple
But he 's seven What kind of stress can he have
But you must have something to go on
And the bad news
REDFIELD It could be extremely useful to jog his memory See if he remembers anything new the next day And I 'll have the test results back in a few days
REDFIELD A journal Just have him write down everything he does
REDFIELD Look Andrea I 'm sure he 'll test negative for brain disorders But there 's something else you can try to monitor his memory
REDFIELD Hold it hold it Andrea Let 's not jump to conclusions I 'll run some preliminary tests see what we can rule out
REDFIELD And you say he does n't remember any of it
Just Like Jason
How Did you Know that
You 're Acting Like your father
Fix
He 's saying it 's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year Overload city 'Sat about the gist of it doc
Cute Evan
Fine You 'll get them Evan But I think it 's far more important to focus on your case right now
I found these The others are still in storage
I do n't know These things take time
I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal He 's sure he can get you off on self-defense so if you 're patient
And then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could
I could n't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms You know he might only have thought he actually remembered them
No it 's just weird with him being such a brain and all I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he 'd forgotten
Ma Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time
Did Da Jason get good grades
Please mom People will talk
I I blacked out
I do n't know I do n't remember
Now your father may seem sleepy to you but that 's just because of his medicine okay
Honey What were you doing with that
Great I 'll see you soon
My father has a bad memory too
You 'll be fine Dr Redfield just wants to give you some tests You 'll like him
Good Because I 've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I 'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there
I get the point kiddo But I 'm not so bad am I
But Lenny said that his dad 's coming and Tommy and Kayleigh 's dad
Ca n't he come out for one day
Um can dad come this time
Thanks Do n't worry Evan you 'll have plenty of time
We 're putting up pictures for Parent 's Night
We 're gon na be late again
Signs of the Lord They just appeared out of nowhere I thought you were loco
Marks scars I dunno Anything could happen I guess
Just tell me if anything weird happens
So when I 'm out I need you to watch my face and hands closely
Shit I knew you were crazy
Straight up
Jesus himself could n't make me take on the Brotherhood When they come just put your mind in another place man Be somewhere else
Best not bitch up Wind up someone 's luggage that way
REDFIELD You remind me of your father He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
REDFIELD Think Evan You 've invented a disease that does n't exist Alternate universes with colleges prisons paraplegia
REDFIELD Books
REDFIELD Hey Evan What 's the big rush We do n't meet for another hour
REDFIELD This is where we 're finding most of the hemorrhaging The outer lining of the cerebral cortex
REDFIELD It 's a little complicated I have n't seen results exactly like these before
REDFIELD The car does n't vanish Evan The movie in your head has broken that 's all But now I 've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car
REDFIELD Go on Nothing can hurt you Remember this is only a movie You 're completely safe
REDFIELD Okay Then go a little forward in time What do you see now
REDFIELD Are you hurting her
REDFIELD Where are you now
REDFIELD Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny Think of it like a movie You can pause rewind or slow down any details you wish Understand
Dad lives here
REDFIELD Hello Evan It 's very nice to meet you He 's as handsome as his father
Get out Both of you
Huh
Shucks I dunno But maybe there 's a reason why you 've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities dammit
Are you stupid or what
What the fuck are you doing
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
That 's probably why Hannibal Lecter 's so smart
Like Ozzy
This is bigger Seven years to the day No blackouts
Get dressed Thumper you 're taking me out for my birthday
Then you think it might have worked out
And
I never knew that So then you still sometimes think of us together
I do n't get it
I was
Kayleigh Do you ever think about us I mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us
Is something the matter
You know how spiritual he 's gotten ever since he saved Mrs Halpern and Katie
We have to get you to Sunnyvale You 're having one of your famous hemorrhages
Well do n't give up now Slick You 've already done so much for me Hell why do n't you go back in time and save Mrs Halpern and her baby Then maybe Lenny would n't freak out and ruin my family
Off to change everyone 's life again is that it Maybe this time you 'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act
Sure you do n't want your wallet
Which is
That I did n't leave you there to rot
I just thought you should know
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that
Oh There 's proof now
I 'm the only person you 've told That 's a great line Does that make other girls swoon Do they actually eat up this bullshit
You 're right Evan I do n't believe you
On the bridge How did you know that Tommy had your dog That was no fucking hunch
Let me ask you a question Just a little one that 's been gnawing at me for years
Because you 're different
I 've seen some sickening shit I do n't blink twice anymore especially in your case
What 's happened to you
Ha Where 's that
Oh I 'm sorry Does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious
So how 's tricks Sorry occupational humor
Oh I thought you were my eight o'clock Make it fast I 'm expecting someone
Evan Stop it It 's not the time
He 's a fucking maniac
What
I know I 've been actin strange lately It 's just that I do n't want anything to happen to us
I walk differently
Like how
What do you mean
My father never laid a hand on me It 's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy
It 's not his fault Evan You knew how bad he had it when we were kids
Please Evan Do n't even joke He would n't hurt you He 's just trying to scare you away from me
It 's my fault I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago
Why are you doing all this for me
I do n't know what to say It 's beautiful
I do n't understand where are you taking me
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect Like looking back whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away
So it did n't feel weird
I dunno Just being weird
Hey uh do n't go freaking out on me over this but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera
Where where are my clothes
Jesus Kayleigh you 're Incredible
You ca n't hate yourself just because your dad 's a twisted freak
No but I think something really bad might 've happened to us
I know but
It 's just did he what happened in the basement
When we were kids Your dad was making a movie Robin Hood or something
Well lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I 'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular It 'd be a big help
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts
Actually Kayleigh the reason I came back to town was to talk to you
Could n't you have moved in with your mom
Wow That must 've taken some courage
They kept him in juvy for a few years Now he works over at Dale 's Autobody
I 've stopped a hundred times
I 'm going to State now Things are going okay I guess Mom 's good
Oh comme si comme ca you know
Hi Lenny
He must be They 're letting him go right
Duck here they come
I ca n't believe Tommy 's still pissed at me He knows I 'm moving away right
I deserve a lot worse
It 's not your fault Mrs Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny
Ouch
I 'm sorry Kayleigh This was a bad idea
Oh God what did we do
We should go soon If Dad catches us smoking down here we 're dead
MILLER That 's dangerous You could blow your hands off
MILLER Easy does it Evan Do n't be a bad boy or I 'll tell mommy you were naughty
MILLER yes
MILLER Who who are you
MILLER What 's happened to How are you doing that
MILLER It 's time for you to stand where the hell I told you
Kayleigh What happened
I was just somewhere else how did I get here
Where am I What happened Where did we all go
We 're really gon na be in a movie
You ca n't play God son It must end with me Just by being here you may be killing your mother
There is no right When you change who people are you destroy who they were
I was praying this curse would have ended with me
Are you okay You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there
It 's okay I wo n't bite You 've seen pictures of me right
Thanks Wow Hey I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers
You 're kidding Are these the answers
We 'll find out soon enough
CARTER The answer 's 'no Mr Treborn Now take a seat The exam 's about to begin
CARTER And you are
CARTER Remember everyone Only two weeks until your science projects are due
CARTER Just do n't drop the ball okay
Oh fine I guess It 's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up so I have n't
Hey I got no choice
I 'm not sure I might have gotten some stories mixed up Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts
It did n't feel like a dream
Come on go on
Freeze No worm-boy No Mr Worm and no Worm-Master-General Once you get a nickname like that you ca n't shake it And I do n't want everyone thinking I 've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something okay
Yeah I 've been keeping journals since I was seven
You 're kidding He 's so big
Smells like sex in here
So what 's the point
Destroy it

Are you sure you even packed it
Uh we should be getting to class now
You knew the whole time did n't you When you put the blade in my hand you knew something big was going to happen Did n't you
Yeah good what else do you remember
Gee thanks friend
Sure I was gon na make a new one anyway
I think I 'll go check out the chapel
Sorry Mrs T He 's been out of sorts lately
Oh goody nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke
I 'll do whatever you want You do n't want me to ever see Kayleigh again fine Just let Crockett go Besides you kill him now and they 'll stick you in juvy for sure And I know you 'd never leave your sister alone with your father
Right Evan I believe you just said sick fuck
It was n't enough that the whole world loves you but you had to take away the last person on earth who did n't think I was a piece of shit
Get this us shit As if I was gon na lay a hand on my own sister You 've done nicely for yourself Evan Nice friends nice life not to mention you 're fucking my sister Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself
What 's wrong with you
What happened Where are we
Hold your horses man It 's here somewhere I saw it when I was a kid
Fat little baby crying for mommy
Sorry Never heard of her
Meant no offense
Nothing Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that
Just get out didja
Shut up Tommy
Lenny Come on
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted You see the way Evan 's mom was looking at you
Where the hell are you taking us anyway Just blow something up already
You are silly He 's a bad sheriff
Quit it Tommy Evan gets to be Robin Hood I 'm gon na be Maid Marian and you 're the Sheriff of Nottingham
Evan guess what Dad got a new video camera and we 're all gon na be in a movie
Maybe it went out Should someone check it
The hell you are n't Anyone of us does it you 'll puss out and narc for sure
Here you go buddy
You put the mommy too far away Mrs Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wan na fix it
Monsieur Rick I
Oh but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe to get to America Oh but if Jan should find out He is such a boy In many ways I am so much older than he is
Oh yes please
And he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart That would be all right would n't it
He always has
And you want to know
And he is still willing to give you a visa
Does he know that
Yes I 'll bet
So you decided to go to America
How long have you been married
I thought so Where 's your husband
Now just a minute Who told you to ask me that
Oh he 's just like any other man only more so
No
He is Well Captain Renault 's getting broadminded Sit down Will you have a drink
I should have known
How did you get in here You 're under age
Yes
But we who are still free will do all we can We are organized Monsieur underground like everywhere else Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois If you would come
As you see it was true every single time Thank heaven I found you Berger I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte He is supposed to help me
In a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
A champagne cocktail please
Mr Berger the ring could I see it again
Such a bargain But that is your decision
What is your name
Then perhaps for the lady The ring is quite unique
You will find a market there for this ring I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
Excuse me but you look like a couple who are on their way to America
I want you to take Miss Lund home
Tonight he forgot
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance It might attract the police
Come up here a minute
Goodnight Monsieur Rick
I wo n't
I will Then I am going to the meeting of the
Oh thank you Herr Rick Sacha will be happy to hear it I owe him money
Oh two weeks maybe three
Well you are in pretty good shape Herr Rick
No thanks Carl
That 's all right
Here you are
Forget it Emil Mistakes like that happen all the time
Well I 'll get it from the safe
It has been a pleasure to meet you
I have to warn you sir I beseech you
I 'd better be going
Here 's to you sir
Do n't forget you owe Rick 's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes
Of course they stay Rick 's would n't be Rick 's without them
Hmmm I happen to know that he gets ten percent But he 's worth twenty five
Ah to get out of Casablanca and go to America You 're a lucky man
Shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
That 's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
Rick I 'll put my cards on the table I think you know where those letters are
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters I will handle the entire transaction get rid of the letters take all the risk for a small percentage
If I could lay my hands on those letters I could make a fortune
Of course not What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are
The bourbon The news about Ugarte upset me very much
I never drink in the morning And every time you send my shipment over it 's always just a little bit short
I see the bus is in I 'll take my shipment with me
Suppose we do
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine
I do n't buy or sell human beings
It 's not for sale at any price
It 's not for sale
Hello Ferrari How 's business at the Blue Parrot
Good day
Thank you very much Good day
Rick
Do you know where they are
Yes something
Well good luck But be careful You know you 're being shadowed
We might as well be frank Monsieur It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca And the Germans have outlawed miracles
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you
You see my dear the word has gone around
And the other alternative
What are they
What value is that You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past
Occupied France
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca
You need n't be concerned about me
She tried everything to get them and nothing worked She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago For your sake she pretended it was n't and I let her pretend
And you never will But I 've got a job to do too Where I 'm going you ca n't follow What I 've got to do you ca n't be any part of Ilsa I 'm no good at being noble but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world Someday you 'll understand that Now now
We 'll always have Paris We did n't have we 'd lost it until you came to Casablanca We got it back last night
Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
I 'm saying it because it 's true Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor You 're part of his work the thing that keeps him going If that plane leaves the ground and you 're not with him you 'll regret it
But Richard no I I
No Richard no What has happened to you Last night we said
I do n't understand What about you
But why my name Richard
Everything is quite all right
No not yet
I wish I did n't love you so much
I ca n't fight it anymore I ran away from you once I ca n't do it again Oh I do n't know what 's right any longer You 'll have to think for both of us for all of us
Oh you 'll help him now Richard wo n't you You 'll see that he gets out Then he 'll have his work all that he 's been living for
Now I do n't know I know that I 'll never have the strength to leave you again
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together A friend came and told me that Victor was alive They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris He was sick he needed me I wanted to tell you but I I did n't care I knew I knew you would n't have left Paris and the Gestapo would have caught you So I well well you know the rest
Oh it was n't my secret Richard Victor wanted it that way Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage That was his way of protecting me I knew so much about his work and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me
It was n't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia They needed him in Prague but there the Gestapo were waiting for him Just a two-line item in the paper Victor Laszlo apprehended Sent to concentration camp I was frantic For months I tried to get word Then it came He was dead shot trying to escape I was lonely I had nothing Not even hope Then I met you
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you wo n't stop at anything All right I 'll make it easier for you
No
I do n't have to I 've got them right here
What of it I 'm going to die in Casablanca It 's a good spot for it
I would n't believe you no matter what you told me You 'd say anything now to get what you want
I would n't bring up Paris if I were you It 's poor salesmanship
I 'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself I 'm the only cause I 'm interested in
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is What an important cause he 's fighting for
I went through all that with your husband It 's no deal
Your unexpected visit is n't connected by any chance with the letters of transit It seems that as long as I have those letters I 'll never be lonely
You use Richard again We 're back in Paris
I told you this morning you 'd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule Well wo n't you sit down
How did you get in
All the same someday you 'll lie to Laszlo You 'll be there
You can believe that if you want to
Last night I saw what has happened to you The Rick I knew in Paris I could tell him He 'd understand But the one who looked at me with such hatred well I 'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we 'll never see each other again We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris If we leave it that way maybe we 'll remember those days and not Casablanca not last night
I do n't think I will Rick
Yes
It does n't matter
Yes that 's very pretty I heard a story once As a matter of fact I 've heard a lot of stories in my time They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs Mister I met a man once when I was a kid it 'd always begin Huh I guess neither one of our stories was very funny Tell me who was it you left me for Was it Laszlo or were there others in between Or are n't you the kind that tells
Well go on tell it Maybe one will come to you as you go along
Has it got a wow finish
Well I did Every one of them Mostly I remember the last one A wow finish A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out
Huh You understand how I feel How long was it we had honey
It 's funny about your voice how it has n't changed I can still hear it Richard dear I 'll go with you any place We 'll get on a train together and never stop
Why did you have to come to Casablanca There are other places
Especially tonight
Oh I saved my first drink to have with you Here
Well why not The captain on a ship can It does n't seem fair that Hey hey what 's wrong kid
Yes I guess it is a little too far ahead Well let 's see What about the engineer Why ca n't he marry us on the train
All right At a quarter to five Say why do n't we get married in Marseilles
The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock I 'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty
No no no no We must leave
I know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened
Ah that 's the new German 77 And judging by the sound only about thirty-five miles away
Looking for a job
Yeah It 's pretty bad timing Where were you say ten years ago
It 's the Gestapo They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow
I 'm on their blacklist already their roll of honor
Well only one answer can take care of all our questions
That 's easy There was He 's dead
Why there is no other man in my life
Yes
I 'm willing to be overcharged Tell me
A franc for your thoughts
We said no questions
He has n't played it in a long time
I will
Yes I put that dress away When the Germans march out I 'll wear it again
No
How nice You remembered But of course that was the day the Germans marched into Paris
Oh I ca n't remember it Miss Ilsa I 'm a little rusty on it
I do n't know what you mean Miss Ilsa
Leave him alone Miss Ilsa You 're bad luck to him
Oh he never well he 's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot He goes up there all the time
Not tonight no more He ai n't coming Uh he went home
I do n't know I ai n't seen him all night
Yes ma'am
Yes ma'am A lot of water under the bridge
Hello Miss Ilsa I never expected to see you again
Yes I 'm ready Goodbye Rick God bless you
Of course I 'll be careful
You do n't even have to say it I 'll believe Goodnight dear
I love you very much my dear
I know how it is to be lonely Is there anything you wish to tell me
When I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris
Ilsa I
Ask me
Did he give any reason
Yes
Whatever I 'd say you 'd carry on Victor why do n't you tell me about Rick What did you find out
Do n't joke After Major Strasser 's warning tonight I am frightened
Victor please do n't go to the underground meeting tonight
We 'll discuss it later
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible
I meant to but something always held me up I love you very much Ilsa
Yes I would
No Ilsa I wo n't let you stay here You must get to America And believe me somehow I will get out and join you
Please Ilsa do n't be hasty
Goodnight
Goodnight
I will do n't worry
I must find out what Berger knows
Victor I 'm afraid for you
Wo n't you join us
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us Perhaps Ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe
You 're saying this only to make me go
I was n't sure you were the same Let 's see the last time we met
This is Mr Laszlo
Oh you 've already met Rick Mademoiselle
Well Mademoiselle he 's the kind of a man that well if I were a woman and I were not around I should be in love with Rick But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man
Mademoiselle you are in Rick 's and Rick is
He came from Paris with Rick
Sam
Here it is
But you did n't know she was at my place last night when you were She came there for the letters of transit Is n't that true Ilsa
I 'm going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on You said you knew about Ilsa and me
All except one thing There 's something you should know before you leave
Good I 've got the letters right here all made out in blank
Oh never mind about that You wo n't have any trouble in Lisbon will you
Keep it You 'll need it in America
Oh save it We 've still lots of things to do
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause Well I am also a human being
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect I know for instance that you are in love with a woman It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman The first evening I came here in this cafe I knew there was something between you and Ilsa Since no one is to blame I I demand no explanation I ask only one thing You wo n't give me the letters of transit All right But I want my wife to be safe I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca
I wonder if you do I wonder if you know that you 're trying to escape from yourself and that you 'll never succeed
You know how you sound Monsieur Blaine Like a man who 's trying to convince himself of something he does n't believe in his heart Each of us has a destiny for good or for evil
We might as well question why we breathe If we stop breathing we 'll die If we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
Yes rather
Thank you
My wife
I beg your pardon
There must be some reason why you wo n't let me have them
I 'll raise it to two hundred thousand
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
Is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record You ran guns to Ethiopia You fought against the fascists in Spain
You must know it 's very important I get out of Casablanca It 's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement You know what I have been doing You know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work
My office
Go ahead
I take that as a great compliment to Sam I suppose he means to you Paris of well happier days
Good evening
Good morning
We 'll come again
I hope we did n't overstay our welcome
Thank you I try
What for
Wo n't you join us for a drink
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca
How do you do
I am making out the report now We have n't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
I believe you have a message for him
By the way Monsieur last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte
Monsieur insofar as it is in my power
And the honor of having served the Third Reich
I am afraid not My regrets Monsieur
With pleasure Wo n't you sit down
That 's strange Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca
I am delighted to see you both Did you have a good night 's rest
We 'll be there
So it is And we have a curfew here in Casablanca It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself
Ricky you 're becoming quite human I suppose we have to thank you for that Mademoiselle
Well A precedent is being broken Er Emil
My bill
Let us say that it is my request That is a much more pleasant word
No Captain please
Thank you I hope you 'll forgive me Captain but the present French administration has not always been so cordial May I present Miss Ilsa Lund
Yes What is it you want
Yes
Good day
You wo n't dare to interfere with me here This is still unoccupied France Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault
And what if you track down these men and kill them What if you murdered all of us From every corner of Europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places Even Nazis ca n't kill that fast
You will give us the names
Even in Berlin
And that is
Is that all you wish to tell us
Whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
Captain Renault I am under your authority Is it your order that we come to your office
This is hardly the time or the place
I 've never accepted that privilege and I 'm now on French soil
I 'm sure you 'll excuse me if I am not gracious but you see Major Strasser I 'm a Czechoslovakian
Why do you stand here Why do n't you stop him
What is the meaning of that phone call
But I have no excuse to close it
But everybody 's having such a good time
I see what you mean
A leader like Laszlo
And if it should change
Captain Renault are you entirely certain which side you 're on
You see Captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
As to Laszlo we want him watched twenty-four hours a day
You give him credit for too much cleverness My impression was that he 's just another blundering American
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr Blaine I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly
Mademoiselle
You see Major you have nothing to worry about Rick
Of course one must admit he has great courage
Rick is completely neutral about everything And that takes in the field of women too
Ho diplomatist
Well personally Major I will take what comes
How do you do Mr Rick
I expected no less Captain
Thank you
Champagne and a tin of caviar
Good evening Captain
I have already heard about this cafe and also about Mr Rick himself
Realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
What else my dear Major
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm Major
Thank you Captain It 's very good to be here
Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
Our expenses
My letter of transit I could use a trip But it does n't make any difference about our bet You still owe me ten thousand francs
I think perhaps you 're right
Well Rick you 're not only a sentimentalist but you 've become a patriot
I suppose you know this is n't going to be pleasant for either of us especially for you I 'll have to arrest you of course
What you just did for Laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him I know a little about women my friend She went but she knew you were lying
Well I was right You are a sentimentalist
You think of everything do n't you
That is my least vulnerable spot
Call off your watch-dogs you said
I suppose you know what you 're doing but I wonder if you realize what this means
I have Sit down over there
Not so fast Louis Nobody 's going to be arrested Not for a while yet
Sam 's piano
I have the letters right here
Yes I know what you mean but I 've already spoken to Ferrari You 'll still win at roulette
Oh he wo n't be followed here
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel so I knew I 'd be on time
Go ahead Ricky
Ricky I 'm going to miss you Apparently you 're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I
I see How do I know you 'll keep your end of the bargain
There 's still something about this business I do n't quite understand Miss Lund she 's very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman
Then release him You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves
Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know Louis I 'll make a deal with you Instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years That would be quite a feather in your cap would n't it
Ilsa Lund That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape The last man I want to see in America
And I 'm taking a friend with me One you 'll appreciate
You 're not very subtle but you are effective I I get the point Yes I have the letters but I intend using them myself I 'm leaving Casablanca on tonight 's plane the last plane
Well they 're all excellent reasons
What makes you think I 'd stick my neck out for Laszlo
But you have n't any actual proof and you know it This is n't Germany or occupied France All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days You might as well let him go now
How can you close me up On what grounds
Put it down as a gesture to love
Yeah Why
Who knows In her own way she may constitute an entire second front I think it 's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little I 'll see you later Rick
Huh
Serves me right for asking a direct question The subject is closed
Well I told Strasser he would n't find the letters here But I told my men to be especially destructive You know how that impresses Germans Rick have you got these letters of transit
Well Ricky I 'm very pleased with you Now you 're beginning to live like a Frenchman
Oh it 's my party
Oh no Rick never
Well you were asking about Rick and here he is Mademoiselle may I present
That makes Rick a citizen of the world
Oh how do you do
Yeah you were saying
I have my orders
The winning side would have paid you much better
Oh laugh if you will but I happen to be familiar with your record Let me point out just two items In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia In 1936 you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side
Louis whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape
Maybe he 's not quite as romantic as you are
He 'll take one
Why two
Okay
I just paid out twenty I 'd like to get it back
Twenty thousand francs says it is n't
Stop it He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe
His escape
It 'll be interesting to see how he manages
Well he 's succeeded in impressing half the world
Victor Laszlo
Yeah What 's his name
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette
Yeah Have a brandy
Perhaps not
Our entertainment is enough
A wise foreign policy
If you are thinking of warning him do n't put yourself out He can not possibly escape
What again
Huh
Waters What waters We 're in the desert
And what in heaven 's name brought you to Casablanca
The clipper to America
The plane to Lisbon You would like to be on it
You know I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
Hello Louis
Come on we 're going to get your coat
Rick I 'm sick and tired of having you
Sacha she 's had enough
I never make plans that far ahead
That 's so long ago I do n't remember
Put it down
Put that phone down
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault and I 'm willing to shoot you
Good evening Mr Blaine
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
You will forgive my curiosity Mr Blaine The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us
I have n't the slightest idea
Well there are certain sections of New York Major that I would n't advise you to try to invade
Are you one of those people who can not imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation
What is your nationality
Rick hide me Do something You must help me Rick Do something
Rick Rick help me
I do n't want them here overnight
For how long
Myself I found myself much more reasonable
Well Rick after tonight I 'll be through with the whole business and I am leaving finally this Casablanca
But think of all the poor devils who can not meet Renault 's price I get it for them for half Is that so parasitic
But why Oh you object to the kind of business I do huh But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I did n't help them That 's not so bad Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas
I forgot You never drink with I 'll have another please You despise me do n't you
Thank you Will you have a drink with me please
They got a lucky break Yesterday they were just two German clerks Today they 're the 'Honored Dead
You thought what
Well what makes you think I have n't
Hello Ugarte
No Mr Richard I ca n't find her
The Germans 'll be here pretty soon now and they 'll come looking for you And do n't forget there 's a price on your head
You said it Here 's looking at you kid
Yes boss
Well I do n't think I can remember it
No I do n't
Just a little something of my own
I bet they 're asleep in New York I 'll bet they 're asleep all over America
Sam if it 's December 1941 in Casablanca what time is it in New York
They grab Ugarte and she walks in Well that 's the way it goes One in one out Sam
Shut up and go home will you
She 's coming back I know she 's coming back
No sir I 'm waiting for a lady
Then do n't have a drink
Good Then have a drink
No
No
Not right now
Yeah
Sorry
He 'll double what I pay you
Sam Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot
Nobody remembers that
It 's bad
Six kilometers Four miles
Shut up I do n't feel like dying today
Then we 've just got shit
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day The next day we just start over again
Nothing out there but ocean
Look again asshole It 's a mirage
You are
Shut up
I 'm serious I 'm always going on about me me me Enough about me Your turn
Damn it Do n't be so negative
They 're on autopilot

Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient
Oh You 've tried
Yeah A long time ago
Hmmm Feels like it might have gotten wet
Want to come in Get dry for a minute
You know what happened to this
Well I have to say I 'm impressed You never gave up
You came on a bicycle No wonder it 's so late
I 've got lots of time
Must be a story there
You Personally
What brings you out to the sticks
Did you really steal a crippled kid 's bicycle to make your deliveries or is that just some bullshit story
You too
I had to come To be sure you were okay
I 've got to get back to Memphis Hannah 's babysitter has finals
What will you do
You okay
This is so unfair
You hated being alone Could n't stand it Busy every minute Always plugged into something
So simple to say so hard to do
Come on Try
The tide came in the tide went out I survived That 's the headline I survived
The plane went down My friends died I washed up on an island Then I found these barrels built the raft and here I am
That about sums it up
What was inside
There was a coffin
What 's that written on the sail
All that time I waited to go on a cruise and you went without me
What 's that
Is that Jango
You have any children
I would have done the same thing
I know
I thought you might have
A few things came up Or went down
Hey hey it 's okay
Go on We 'll be fine I 'll feed Jango to the frogs
Chuck you 're breaking my heart
Get back From where
Look we 'll do our trip as soon as I get back
I guess I had n't thought through how I felt
I burned the Christmas tree
I 'm sorry about the presents I got a little carried away
There is n't any us
That 's your dog
No
We 're not over-reacting
This is n't working out
I have to
Look I love the puppy I love you But I have to go
A ring I wanted a ring
For when I travel

He is a cute thing
Hey look at you

Four four A record
Merry Christmas eve

Chuck forget the Xerox So Russia did n't turn out well
I thought I did
Cold
Let 's take a look
You smell like formaldehyde
Hey be nice to it it 'll be nice to you
There 's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour goes through Sydney
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow
Terrific Yours
I need the latest PDRs on St Petersburg
Doc I 'm not on the island I 'm not on the raft I 'm alive I 'm so glad to be back I ca n't tell you I just want out of here
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you
If you say you are
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability depression anxiety periods of self-reproach It 's almost like schizophrenia Different sides of your personality might come to life speak out act out
And fish are very low in fat which is energy inefficient So you 're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas which contain some Vitamin C so you did n't get scurvy
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage
Dehydration Vitamin deficiency Protein deficiency Any or all of the above
Under the circumstances your overall health is good Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated but they 're healing nicely
Yeah
Sure
I used to drive one of those A long time ago
You 're not out of Pascagoula are you
Need some help
Come on down to the plant It 's state of the art We 're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business
True enough No sacred chickens nowhere so far as I know
But chickens
Thought you were going to bring her
Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thou bounty through Christ the Lord Amen
What a journey you 've had It seems more than a person should have to bear
I 've got all this back pay coming Why do n't you let me get you a place in town
Roger got me on I was n't doing anything and but you 're back you 're really back I would have come to Memphis but
There 's settled folks and there 's nomads You 're just not a settled folk You never belonged here
I 'm doing fine
Do n't you even think about it
Oh no the prodigal son 's home We bring out the store bought
That new roof that 's your doing
It 's nothing you did Mom believe me
Mom meet Jango
You 're looking at a Level III search For your Level III you got ta have E-4 authorization I do n't have it
Hmmm Durango Colorado Asheville North Carolina then canceled her account
What about the sender
Kamal you 're breaking up Can you hear us
Who 's in charge then where is Chinn
What 's going on down there
Who is this Where is Kamal
No sweat
Finish what you started You have n't changed Chuck It 's still you
You want that delivered we 'll deliver it That 's what we do
What then
Not just that Take your time Use it Live it
That 's what it 's about
Take your time
Digital laser readers
That 's all there is
To life Fuck 'em if they ca n't take a joke
I 'm serious The burning bush the big picture the words in neon
You 've been over the line and you came back You 've been saved hallelujah
To Wilson
When I first showed up I thought you 'd lost your fucking marbles
You were how long on this
Must have taken a hell of a long time
Cool ropes
This stinks really bad
How about we go somewhere else
Hello
I beat the odds
You 're fucking dead
God damn God damn Chuck it 's you
Hello
Malaysia 's tanking We 're meeting in ten in operations
Talk is cheap Are we on or not
A hundred rubles St Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month
I 'm trying to help you here There 's Warsaw there 's this
Take the plunge admit your mistakes move on to tomorrow That 's FedEx that 's women that 's life
That 's why I 'm running foreign and you 're not That 's why you 're not married and I am
We 're warriors not desk jockeys We 've got to be bold You always want all your ducks lined up But nothing 's 100 percent It 's always 60-40 maybe 51-49 Hell I 'd take 40-60 Then roll the dice
You know General McLelland he would n't attack unless he had everything just right Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said General if you 're not going to use my army could I borrow it for a while So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said let 's go
Look I 'm sorry about your plane But I could n't risk being late into Memphis
For all those vacation days you got coming
I did n't know we had sailboats
You know what your problem is You just see the packages in front of you You do n't see the big picture
What Let Paris hold its plane Let Memphis take care of it Let somebody down the line clean up your mess
The point of FedEx as I understand it is to make the damn connection
I 'm touched
But I might not have
It was fifteen minutes late
Great Terrific The good guys won one for a change
Borrowed I borrowed it
No please join me Some sundried fish strips a few eyeballs some gills to munch on
As it happens I 'm headed for Frisco myself
May I ask where are you bound
Permission to come aboard sir
Dr Homer Wells
You do n't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples
Oh my yes This is a far superior taste and crisp too You know so many apples are disappointingly mealy I wonder of most of the apples in my life were n't meant for pies
These credentials are against the law
You invented him You 've completely made his up
This is your life story Wilbur You just changed the dates
It 's that Mrs Goodhall you have to be careful of Wilbur
Just find him some clothes Wilbur He could use some clothes
Oh just stop it You knew this was going to happen He 's a young man
He 'll need clothes some money
They just want you to hire some new help
It was just the ether Wilbur
Then I was n't beautiful
You were n't dreaming about me
Life is waiting
It claims to restore monthly regularity
Try to think of nothing Dorothy
I do n't know She got left here like the rest of us did n't she
I doubt it She 's just an
I know
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them Just sometimes
And that I can drive a truck
Uh I 'd like to show them that I can cook a little
Yeah But sometimes I wish I could meet mine anyway
Why not
I mean your parents
I 'm not a doctor
I 'm not a doctor I have n't been to medical school I have n't even been to high school
He 's a doctor Buster doctors smell like ether
It 's because he 's too tired to sleep He has to
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here he could pick up a telephone and call us
They 'll believe it because they want to believe it
I 'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted
She died of secrecy she died of ignorance
Good night Daddy
Daddy please
Good night Daddy
Wally said to say Hello
Daddy it 's a letter to me
It 's time somebody ate them
No I 'm the one who should be sorry You have every right to be angry
I know you do n't think much of being needed or of me for that matter
This came for you a couple of days ago Olive asked me to bring it With everything happening I guess she forgot
Do you think she 'll be all right
And now that Wally 's coming back and because he 'll certainly need you
did Well okay
I helped you not to think about Wally You were so upset you could n't stand worrying about him about his being killed and not coming back but when you were with me you could stop worrying well for a while anyway This is how I helped you right
Please do n't make me say it again
He 's alive He still loves you So do I
I know I 'm sorry
You got up You did something If you keep this up you might be in danger of making a decision
I 'm not trying to be anything I 'm just doing nothing If I wait and see long enough then with any luck I wo n't ever have to make up my mind Decisions can be painful after all
Go anywhere Of course not That would be doing something would n't it We would n't want to do something Let 's just sit here all night
No do n't that 's something Nothing is nothing Do n't even look at me I want
No Nothing is nothing I want Wally to come home I 'm afraid to see him too
Nothing
We 've got to keep her away from that bastard
He 's the father He 's her baby 's father
You do n't understand It 's her father
She wo n't go to St Cloud 's
I told her She does n't feel she can do that Something about her father not letting her go anywhere
It 's a good thing I did n't have that baby is n't it
No That 's not all there is to it I love you too I know I do
I grew up with Wally I began my adult life with him
Do you think I 'm having a good time Do you think I 'm just teasing you Do you think I know whether I want you or Wally
Olive told me You might have told me yourself
What will be okay
Just tell me Do you want me to go Do you want me to stay
I know this was right
Are n't you worried that people will cut their feet
That 's what I'd come here for I 'd watch the movie
How could you not care about the movie
Ah-ha So what is that a radio
Did you come here with Wally to not watch movies
Just a little privacy
But you had so much responsibility
You do n't miss it
At least you were never lonely
What are you so crazy about the movies for
The screen is enormous Imagine King Kong up there Have you seen a lot of movies here
You 're a natural You were born to drive a car like this
What 's the medical explanation
She was torn apart She died of a broken heart
She did love him How many women have you known
I did like it All I said was It 's not 'King Kong
King Kong It 's really good
Yes I 've only seen one though
People watched the movies in their cars
A movie outside
I better go
You have to come to my dad 's lobster pound and see one then
Uh have you been feeling okay
So Not bored yet
I guess I 'll see you around the orchards Thanks for everything
I 'm a little worried about the about how much bleeding is okay
I ca n't have a baby alone I do n't even know if he 's coming back
Burma
He 's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay They 're going to be shooting at him
I 've never seen the ocean either
I 've never seen a lobster
Is your family in the apple business too
How many months are you
So Mrs
You can trust me Is it Jack It 's not Jack is it It 's Muddy Is it Muddy
ROSE I ca n't go nowhere
Yes I have
Rose I know what 's going on Homer told me I got pregnant too about a year ago I 've been through this
I 've got some more clothes for you I just keep forgetting to bring them with me
Hi
ROSE How is that Wally doing
He thinks people like to get whacked by branches
You 've been giving him a flying lesson
I was just showing Homer the orchards kind of a geography lesson
I love you Wally
There You said it was boring
You said Apples are n't exactly flying
Wally thinks apples are boring
I do n't want you to walk I want to carry you Should I put the top up It might get cold
Well this is an orphanage
Only the right people can have you Curly
Nobody special enough Curly
That 's true
You 're one of the best Curly we could n't let just anyone take you
They wanted a girl
Does he know he 's supposed to be in India Does he even want to come back
I just wanted to ask you
He probably does n't make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them too
But what about school records Homer does n't have any diplomas
Well we can only guess about that Edna They are against the law
graduated Bowdoin College 1935 and Harvard School of Medicine 1939
Homer Wells born Portland Maine March 2 1915
I do n't know He 's just leaving you 're the one who says he needs to see the world That's what he 'll do he 'll see the world
That 's a heavy sedation
Her temperature is a hundred and four
What 's an immigrant
Did you grow up around here
What 's a nanny do
Did you know your mother better
But did you know him
Liver killed him
Is your father dead
Do n't get too excited Fuzzy
Uh it 's the end of October
I was a posthumous child My father 's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it
Uh sure that 's what Kong thinks all right
AGNES I must have been dreaming of kissing someone
AGNES Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me
AGNES I do n't remember
I do n't think so Homer I'm the lucky one
You 're the one who 's helping me Homer You 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I 'm gone Candy too
Uh I 'm shipping out sooner than I thought I just wanted to be sure you were settled in and happy enough considering Are you bored stiff Or can you stick it out for a bit
What about the trees
Yes They pick fruit all kinds They travel up and down the coast with the seasons The trick to Mr Rose is you have to let him be the boss
They 're migrants
Uh look if you 're serious about wanting a job picking apples is n't that boring
What lousy luck I mean your orders to draw an assignment like that
At what altitude
Burma run because you fly over Burma
I do n't have any time There 's a war
The only jobs are picking jobs Picking apples is truly boring
You 're a little overqualified are n't you
We 're heading back to Cape Kenneth
Sure Be glad to Uh a ride where
Actually someone did I just did n't think I could eat anything
No it 's not serious I 'm just not supposed to get excited You know no strain no stress I try to keep calm all the time
They would n't take me I 'm Class IV I 've got a heart defect
Liberator
What kind of plane are you flying
No Dr Larch will be performing the procedure
It 's okay I do n't mind
Right
ROSE That 's 'cause I sticked my own knife in the wound after she go I sticked my own knife in there I poked it all around I just tryin to find the same place she got me
ROSE She just plan misunderstand me I was tryin to give her my knife I was just reachin to touch her hand But I understand if she misunderstand me it 's all my fault ai n't that right
ROSE If that was your knife Muddy I wan na thank you for givin it to her no girl should be goin hitch-hikin if she do n't got a good knife with her
ROSE I 'm stayin Homer
Merthiolate ether vulval pads gauze lots of gauze
One cervical stabilizer two sets of dilators Douglas points One medium sized curette one small one medium speculum one large two vulsellum forceps
Mr Rose I 'm in the doctor business If you want I can help you You do n't have to go anywhere
ROSE You forget yourself Homer This here 's my daughter You got your own mess to deal with ai n't that right
ROSE And I love her There ai n't nobody else gon na treat her as good as I do I would n't do nothin to hurt her Homer you must know that
Go on cut my clothes I 've got other clothes
You 're lying How can you with your own daughter
You 're actually having sex with your own little girl Is that possible
Is it true
ROSE You still doin it too fast
ROSE Slow down Homer do n't be in such a big hurry
What about the worms Most of these apples are the drops off the ground right There have to be worms
ROSE Homer you the only one who 's read them rules so you the only one who feels like he 's doin somethin wrong
I guess so
Okay
Right
ROSE Out back there 's a shed It 's just a mess If that shed was better organized I could put my truck in there
You know everything I know plus what you 've taught yourself you 're a better doctor then I am and you know it
It 's your heart you ought to take it with you
I do n't need your gratitude
Are you really so stupid that you imagine you 're going to find a more gratifying life What you 're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here only nobody takes care of them as well And you wo n't be able to take care of them either There 's no taking care of anybody not out there
In other parts of the world I suppose there are other ways
Doubtless you 'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do
Try to look at it this way Buster and I are sitting right here beside you We could have ended up in the incinerator
I 'm happy I amuse you
How about this child You expect her to be responsible
It is I 'll get this You go ahead
It 's your splice You blame me for everything
We have n't had a Wilbur here in a year or so have we We used to have dozens
I 'm not crazy about the Little
You do it then
Ca n't a boy be a Dorrit
It 's my turn
Where 's the name sheet
But is n't Fuzzy just well underdeveloped
I have n't read that
Good boy Good job And you call yourself not a doctor Keep an eye on her she 's in trouble
If you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C
Christ it 's oil of tansy
It 's obviously an aborticide
It looks like scurvy
There was no visible wound
One it 's illegal Two I did n't ask how to do it you just showed me
All I said was I do n't want to perform abortions I have no argument with you performing them
Yes for both
Right
Just promise me that if there 's a blizzard you 'll move into Wally 's room until it 's over
I do n't know Just promise me one thing
There 's not a lot of work in the winter and you 'll have to tolerate Vernon even Wally despises him and Wally likes everyone
What I mean is I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here Homer
Thanks guys I 'd like to go with you But I 've got to move on
We heard that one already Homer
Long enough You ai n't gon na stop it
Do n't mess in this Homer if you know what 's good for you
That 's it
Rose listen do n't do anything You know I mean to yourself Please listen
ROSE You think Daddy 's gon na let me go anywhere I ai n't going nowhere
Rose please listen Whatever you want to do I can help you
But you do n't look very happy
I know more than I want to know about it Who 's the father
You 're not yet three months are you
ROSE I guess you must like watchin me be sick
Almost
Give men that I know how to do it
I 'm not in trouble
ROSE You ai n't gettin in no trouble I hope

ROSE So what
ROSE What you got a picture of your heart for
ROSE What 's that
Rose Rose
You mean swimmin I ai n't goin in that vat to fish out no cigarette
Them people drinkin that cider they do n't know there 's a cigarette in there
ROSE You think so Jack Well I would n't want to be in that Wally 's shoes tonight
ROSE Jack you got ta watch your language 'round my daughter
ROSE Now now He 's a good boy
Anyway I was just showing you this guy as an example of what 's available I did n't think you 'd be interested
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him
Does it snow in Bombay One winter here and we 'll be shipping him south in a coffin
No I do n't want to know him He 's doing missionary work in India I wrote him weeks ago but he 's either too holy or too busy to answer Maybe he got killed in the war
WINSLOW Four weeks or so right around Halloween
WINSLOW No autonomic effects that 's correct
Then it 's malaria
Why was he missing for twenty days
ROSE Who live here in this cider house Peaches Who grind them apples who press that cider who clean up the mess and who just plain live here just breathin in the vinegar Somebody who don't live here made them rules Them rules ai n't for us We the ones who make up them rules We makin our own rules every day Ai n't that right Homer
ROSE Then you pickin 'em too fast they ai n't no better than drops to me See that bruise and that one Half of these is bruised Look at this one It ai n't got no stem You might as well step on 'em too they only good for cider
ROSE You pickin nothin but cider apples Peaches I hope you understand that

We see you next harvest
Sorry Homer
Ai n't you gon na see what it is Homer
ROSE They told me I was too old to serve
That what happen you lost you only daughter so 's you killed yourself That 's what we say all right
You taught her I suppose
ROSE Tell him what you want Muddy you is the crew boss today
ROSE Tell that Vernon to mind his own business Muddy
Yeah we can wait all night for the water to come back on you just go on and take your time
ROSE Well Muddy we can look at all these angry stars Homer 's been readin to us about

ROSE That 's right Homer This ai n't your business
ROSE I ai n't your business no more Daddy Please let me go
ROSE You got ta let me go Daddy Please
ROSE You just stay out of trouble Homer
ROSE You oughta know you do n't go to jail for cuttin a guy 's clothes Ai n't that right Homer
ROSE Now now darlin Jack just needs to know what business he 's in
ROSE That 's right that sounds like trouble to me
ROSE What 's lucky about that
ROSE Daddy I 'd like to be in that Wally 's shoes every night
You ever see a palm tree Homer
She took off in the night
Yeah that cigarette ai n't hard to find when you 're properly undressed
You 're lucky he did n't cut your nipples off man
That Candy she 's the nicest girl I know
Oh Well thanks for the drink
No no Nothing like that I work in a bank
Well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery
On me For the seat Cheers
That 's right So brainiacs that we are we thought we 'd be innovative and relocate east Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here
It 's more like what are n't I doing My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley but then again who has n't up there
Oh god I 'm overbearing and rude Lily Lily Finn
Uh Maker 's Mark Rocks
Tough day
I was n't sure if you 'd make it
Jake Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah it 's going through
Two million
The standard ten
No I understand that What I mean What I 'm trying to say I was actually wondering about Well my cut
Let 's just slow down for a second
What 's this
I know It wo n't go unnoticed
Everything looks in order
Yes That 's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little
Exactly But the Catch-22 is that you ca n't tell anyone about the offer because if it 's public you could start a bidding war and that 's considered a breach of etiquette It could kill a deal But wait too long and you 're not considered hot anymore
Right The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do They get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company Microsoft Intel Oracle whatever The beauty of it is they 've pretty much sold the company before they 're even real The bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works So they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan
Listen what I 'm about to tell you I 'm telling you in confidence okay Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com
We know exactly how we 're going to make the money back There in lies the Catch-22
They scare people off because most people lack vision Vision and balls Present company excluded of course
A capacity for gross fund recovery Yeah we got that part
Maybe you can help us understand what 's so hard about getting a corporate loan
What do I do I 'm the VP of Finance
I envy you guys Taking a chance like that
AL It 's Alfonse I want to settle up I have n't been ducking you I told you I 'd get it
AL I 'm gon na go get eggrolls Anyone want eggrolls
AL Yeah but come on All I get to do is cry and get insulted
AL Hey Jake When am I gon na get to play the Inside
Guess so
It 's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government
Today Started off great
She walked
We were back on
It 's not true
I was doing it for them
You know when the first con was ever played It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy The same numbers everyday for sixteen years One day he gets pissed off tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million
Having a gun pointed at you for one It 's not like breaking a mirror bad luck but it 's bad Three on a match black cats Believe it Believe it all
Luck 's a funny thing Especially the bad
Back in WWI or WWII one of the WW 's if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were Then well It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had So three on a match is bad luck
We got our stake Now we need to find our guy in Gillett 's bank
Cue the fucking violins Come on It 's getting cold
Factors that were n't clear to me until now
That was it We had our crew Now we needed the Mark
Suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someone 's going to start asking the right questions Usually it takes a little longer
In this case you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con
Keep going I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby
Keeping the Fix happy
I 'm not saying anything Besides you 're one to talk You 're the one who 's got me on my knees in a dark alley
It 's all about the money is n't it
Grifters
Just the last three weeks
Gee What makes you say that
No I 'm not the Anti-Christ Or the Prince of Darkness I 'm just a guy looking for some answers
Know who I am Jake
Fine But only if we recover the cash
And how much did you say you wanted for this What did you call it A finder 's fee
I think so The airport 's going to be crawling with police Traffic will be a nightmare Go down to the bar If they pull it off great Have someone deal with Ashby
Let 's see Let 's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught We get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation I do n't much like that idea Then again let 's suppose he actually gets through Customs Now that 'll be something We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud We double our money
I got ta work off some of this adrenaline I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn Anybody want in
It 's not like she 's a real redhead Jake
People have tried this before Jake It 's never worked Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it Last year Mumps got pinched in L.A
Alright let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second Is this the best thing to do
We 're going to give him the money back
Come on
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young The whole thing took about two and a half hours That 's how good he is
You 're pissed we did n't get credit
So what We hide right
Mob
What 's a King Pin
Who 's that
That 's it What are you talking about We can still do this
Moonan Here Shit
I 'm going home
Jake
Masters of our own destiny
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens
So that 's it
Jake
Calls
You 'll be there
We 're going to make it back Grant Three or four times over
Uh No thanks I 'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off
She got one leg out from under him Now we had to lean
She up for this
You laugh now but wait until you need a clean place to powder This is New York city Sister Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob Let 's do the list Hepatitis influenza the flesh eating disease
Yeah Whatever Jake
How 's that He works for Gillette
We get fifty percent And we get clear of the King
Two million
Yes her Where 's my wallet
Tonight Just me
Leave him Someone 's going to find him eventually Then they 'll start looking for us too
You know what we 're doing with the money
Well this is just fucking great
I just do n't know if this says me What 's the fabric
I guess I got ta drop a dime Did anybody mess up the hoop
That 's a lot of cash He came up with it pretty quick
But you wo n't get that splatter effect
Shit
I think I just broke my hand
PIN Come here
PIN Come here Feel this
PIN Look at you you skinny prick
Excuse me
PIN Listen Scooter
Nothing ventured nothing gained
I need you to stake me I ca n't do it without it It 's just a couple hundred grand Taken out of our cut when we 're done
I need you to stake me
I think two million
PIN You ask a lot of questions Come on Let me see 'em
We got caught So you know it wo n't happen again
No Just confidence
I 'll get the money back plus interest I go on the grift for you You get a cat I get a cut And we get square
Because you killed one of my crew
Let me rephrase I wo n't do that
I ca n't do that
I apologize for the inconvenience
You ca n't cheat an honest man
I guess it lacks a certain style
Minus one
I have a good crew
Jake You can call me Jake Here and there
Do n't worry about Moonan We got him covered When It was him There 's a shipment coming through tonight Kennedy
Good boy
I do n't know what you 're into with the King Pin but whatever it is we get a piece understand We get a big piece If we find out you 're keeping us out I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself Say something stupid if we got a deal Jake
Well he 's in town and he sure as shit remembers you What are we going to do about this Jake We ca n't afford to have a Fed onto us
Ring it for him Sobo
Special Agent Gunther Moonan Ring a bell
Tip was fine Jake We were a little more curious about the Fed
Was that a threat Did I hear a threat Last I remember we were talking economics then this What happens next time if we got ta stop and help a little old lady cross the street Well shit Then we got ta pass the call to someone else
Do n't get me wrong Jake I like you boys You guys are the steadiest business in town But what can I say Twenty percent 's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals
What are you talking about Ten 's standard
Thank you sir You know I hope this is n't too much of an inconvenience but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend perhaps I could give you something for her It 's a check We split the cost on a few books and I have n't had the chance to pay her back yet Could you
LEWIS Take it from me you never do But congratulations Nice to be married is n't it
LEWIS Attractive girl
LEWIS What brings you down from Boston Jake Taking advantage of the long weekend
Well it certainly is a coincidence Here of all places How is Mrs Lewis
Jake Jake Pearson I go to lawschool with your daughter Carolyn We met once or twice
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now
Help me
LISTEN to me We do n't have much time We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me
Listen to me It went to shit It happens sometimes
I had to That motherfucker was about to welch You saw what he was doing right You heard him
I lost my head I 'm Sorry I do n't know what happened
What do you want An apology

So there it is You got that big itch you need to scratch It 's all about the fucking money What do you want an apology
What about what
There are three people I trust him him and a guy who got killed I do n't know who you are You 're like some stray dog that wandered into the house So I 'm telling you to cut loose of this No one 's looking for you Not the King not Moonan and not Gillette Just go wherever it is you would go It 's over
Hey we fucked once honey That hardly makes you a good judge of character And do n't think I did n't know you were working some angle with that either
No I 'm not going to take it easy You ca n't stay clear of this guy He will be on this until the end of time
You know why I told you that Jake Because I trust you too
I do n't know I packed up my shit and ran away To this So unlike you I guess I do have something to prove in a repressed anger sort of way
After Glenn was finished he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home The next day I finished my shift and met him around back like we always did I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest Three or four times
Shit what was that guy 's name I really liked him
He was looking out for you
Glenn talked you out of it
You guys got busted This is a great neck
Yeah the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now
Sounds respectable
I SAID HOW DO Deal with that
How do you deal with
You have really soft hands Like a baby 's
How do you know I will
So that was my part Smile and shake my ass
It 's more than that
Whatever But you I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything So why this
I 'm your basic underachiever Ca n't stand working and porn does n't seem like a good option
Do you have something to prove
Why Your mother not breast feed you or something
I think you 'd do it for free You 're almost drooling You like the rush
Look at you You want to go
We 're getting down to the wire Apparently another company has a similar product in R D right now If they beat us to it
What about this Do you have any idea what this means You 've killed us We 're dead

Michelle Strigo Loan officer
No the corporate papers have to be legit But you got ta score an I.D A clean one Talk to Suits I got ta get us a Banker

You really like that bitch do n't you I got ta tell you I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut You know how it is get her to do some shit for you throw her a bang to keep her happy But if you 're into her That 's cool
What 's up with you Bladder infection

You 're a weasel
So that 's it huh You get the cops to give you a safe ride
What 'd he say
Point Lupus Give us a point
My fucking heart bleeds
Of what They 're both crooks
Do n't worry I 'll settle up with your boss We have n't skipped town yet
I 'll find the time
When this is all over you 're going to tell me who the King put on Al
Ca n't do it Suits I ca n't lay down for this one
Then I got ta say in my opinion you ca n't get what you want
So what do you want
I do n't doubt your talent You looking for that place in the hall of fame
The King Jake you play the heavy rackets like that They put the lug on for nothing at all
Then who 's the Banker
I saw you go up from the Knecker working that Grind learning the Barnard 's Law and I thought the kid 's a prodigy But I know that if you 're using these goods So then I figure what 's worth that You 're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund Who 's the Mark
A little bit of both

Aces Suits

PIN Good Good Do not let Vig out of your sight
PIN So do half the other people in this place How do I know which one
PIN Speak
PIN A Fed Is he close
PIN Consider him part of your crew Consider him a part of me
We 're here
Let 's just say he burned me once
Did he buy it
Like we told you before we think he 's into something with the King Pin
If you Feds are so hot for him why do n't we just bring him in right now
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered so you can imagine the smell Bad for the neighbors good for me because in all the time I 've been looking for Jake this is only the second time I 've even gotten a whiff of him
Special Agent
He 's headed towards the eastern most exit Do not under any circumstances approach I want to follow this all the way down to Vig
Whaddya mean We got dick
Literally It 's not a bad deal gentleman I get peace of mind You get Detective Sheilds But this is the best part Walter Walter your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile Capice
Not everyone 's on the take Walter
Peace of mind
You help me catch him Whatever he 's into next I want you to be into And what you 're into I 'm into If it all goes well those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape I 'll clear you guys of anything you 've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation This prick 's been on the wish list for so long you 'll probably get gold shields out of it
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig He sent me a birthday card Belated but it 's the thought right Oh this prick 's got a sense of humor But then again you guys probably know him better than I do In fact I 've only met the guy once But now now I have you The next best thing His partners His Fix
Who
High five

It 's just insurance
You trust this Moonan guy
Bullshit it 's cosmetic My fucking tooth was cracked in half I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity The department 's dental is for shit

It 's the truth
Marion It 's a book
It 's because of the sex is n't it You do n't like the sex in it
He was a loser This guy 's a croupier He ca n't lose People have shat on him all his life Now he 's in control He 's a winner

I loved the atmosphere But it destroyed my poor mother
Now there 's a coincidence My father used to gamble there
Near the casino
No no I come every couple of years I always think I 'm going to stay I 'm from Cape Town originally
I was at a loose end A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership
I 'm not much of a gambler really I just like this bar

Mostly people in the casino business A few drug dealers
I do n't know what that means I 'm talking about not rocking the boat
So it 's Mr Clean Wise up Jack this whole business is bent The casino is nothing but legal theft And that 's OK It 's the system Half the punters who come in are using stolen money drug money they have n't earned it We earn our money I 'm on your side Jack I do n't need an enemy
I do n't get you Even if it was true which it is n't what the fuck difference would it make to you

You can start Monday week
Very impressive
No
Yes
First offence verbal warning Second offence written warning That one 's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board My discretion Third offence you 're sacked on the spot You 'd never work in a casino in this country again There 's another rule you 're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino If you see someone who 's gambled here even if it 's just casually on the street you must ignore him Or her You 're not married are you
We 'd know There are no secrets in this casino You 'd be punished
This is n't South Africa We 'd know because someone would report it Believe me someone always does
Next point Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden
Ever
For the database It can be accessed by every casino in the country We have the same system for punters
Let me just run through a few things As a dealer you never gamble not anywhere We 'll need your picture
You want me to check
It 's a rule Always stand by your first count The odds are you 're right
Five
Five
You wo n't Not without permission
Not with your own cloth Besides your pockets will be stitched
I do n't think so
They 've been tested
We do
Give me 365
Any exceptions
It 's the procedure here Now sort the chips
We check every four days
We tried But there was n't enough business The punters like company
There are three types of casino in the U.K High volume Small faction And MOTR That 's middle of the road Us
I was at Beadles
No
Has he
Jack
Yoo hoo bomb
It 's Talby He 's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
Doolittle are you there
Boiler we 're alive My heart
Oh God
We 're gon na die Boiler We 're gon na die
Christ twenty seconds Christ
You must have it you idiot we can stop the bomb
Where is it What did you do with it
Where 's the fail-safe key
No no the key the key to the fail safe lock
The key
What 's he doin
I can tell the damn thing just does n't understand
There she is Definite 99 plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations It 'll spiral in toward its sun and
Yeah
I 'm not sure I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
The one on unit oh I think it 's GMR twelve zero zero
I 'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels
Ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand
Can you beat that I always knew Talby was weird
open quantum latches
I read the same here
He just likes it up in the dome that 's all
Pinback throw me the chart log
Hey Doolittle here 's one An unstable planet 85 probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star
All right then
Well there 's the possibility of
Well it is kind of a long shot
Well I show a 95 probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula
Not much Nothing at all in this sector
Time to start talking
Begin main sequence Mark at 10-9-8 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop
Well then everything sounds fine We 'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds Good luck
Arm yourself bomb
All right I have detonation time at Wait a minute something 's wrong with the clock All right I have detonation time at no that ca n't be right it says three years Okay I have six minutes exactly Does that check out down there
Swell Let 's synchronize detonation time Do you know when you 're supposed to go off
Well bomb we have about sixty seconds to drop Just wondering if everything is all right Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
Hey bomb
Snap out of it bomb
20 The only thing which exists is myself
20 False data can act only as a distraction Therefore I shall refuse to perceive you
20 Therefore I shall ignore you
20 You are false data
You wo n't consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
But you ca n't explode in the bomb bay It 's foolish You 'll kill us all There 's no reason for it
Everything sounds fine bomb Dropping you off in sixty seconds Good luck
Right that synchronizes here Okay bomb arm yourself
Do you remember the detonation time
One hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
Fail safe in lock Four minutes to drop 22 minutes to detonation This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb 20 Do you read me bomb
20 I have no proof that it was false data
20 nine seconds
20 Hmmm
20 True but since this is so I have no proof that you are really telling me all this
20 I recall distinctly the detonation order My memory is good on matters like these
20 Yes well
20 Of course not
20 That is correct
20 To explode of course
20 Because I must detonate in seventy five seconds
20 Intriguing I wish I had more time to discuss this matter
20 Why that would mean I really do n't know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
20 In other words all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
All right now here 's the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
Right
That 's good Very good Now then how do you know that anything else exists
Intuition is no proof What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
But how do you know you exist
Fine Think about this one then how do you know you exist
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts
Hello bomb are you with me
Bomb this is Doolittle You are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay Disarm yourself This is an order
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb 20 I repeat previous order you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay Do you understand
Yeah Doolittle What 's up
Oh sure
5-4-3-2-1-drop drop drop
automatic channels open
open circuit breakers
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop
Veil nebula
Hey Doolittle think we 'll ever find real intelligent life out there
Wha
Come on Doolittle give it a name
Commander Powell would have named it
The new star What are you gon na name it
What are you gon na name it
Any of 'em any good
Any planets
Which one
Boiler can you set me up with some temp figures
I need a computer reading on a fail safe mark
Doolittle
Yes Doolittle
I 'll check it
I said I 'm trying to reach Talby Something 's wrong with the damn intercom I need a last-minute diameter approximation
Mafhkin oble groop
I really liked you too Talby Hey some debris from the ship It 's coming right by me
Yeah
No kidding
Phoenix
Oh yeah
When you fall Doolittle if there 's anyone down there on the planet somebody may see you They may see you coming down What a beautiful way to die as a falling star
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship Nothing we can do about it now Hey it looks like the skipper He made it Commander Powell made it
Here I am I think I 'm spinning We 're both falling Talby in opposite directions away from each other My my jetpack 's gone
Calm down Talby I 'm coming
Well I 'm in the Emergency Air Lock and
Ah well I think I 've found the malfunction sir I 'm in the Emergency Air Lock
Ah Lieutenant Doolittle Sir
Sorry to interrupt your lunch sir but I 'm in the Computer Room and I think I 've located the malfunction The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser down by the Emergency Air Lock Ca n't pinpoint it exactly but I 'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it
Lieutenant Doolittle this is Talby Lieutenant
I really think I should try and locate it immediately Might be something important
Ah Doolittle I do have a malfunction on this readout but I ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
I ca n't seem to locate the malfunction exactly
Lieutenant Doolittle I 'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems
I think I 'm getting a malfunction here somewhere
I 'm getting something here on this readout
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years The Phoenix Asteroids From what I 've heard Doolittle they glow glow with all the colors of the rainbow Nobody knows why They just glow as they drift around the universe Imagine all the sights they 've seen in the time they 've been travelling the birth and death of stars things we 'll never see The universe is alive Doolittle I thought it was all empty but it is n't In between the stars it 's seething with light and gasses and dust There are little pebbles drifting around planets no one on Earth has ever seen No one but the Phoenix Asteroids
You know Doollttle if we 're going into the Veil Nebula we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the Phoenix Asteroids They should be passing through there about now
You see I can watch things up here Doolittle I love to watch things just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids gas clusters
I do n't like to go below since Commander Powell died I feel enclosed down there If it were big enough I 'd sleep up here
I like it up here
Okay Doolittle I 'll have it in a minute
Oh Ah yes Doolittle What is it
Yeah the skipper always was lucky
Phenomenology
No no Doolittle you talk to it Teach it Phenomenology Doolittle
Talk to the bomb
Oh yes Well Doolittle if you ca n't get it to drop you 'll have to talk to it
Oh yes Doolittle I 'm thinking
Ah it seems to me Doolittle Sorry I 've drawn a blank Hold it I 'll have it again in a minute I forget so many things in here so many things Hold on just a minute let me think
Sorry
Doolittle hello
Well what you might try is
Sorry Doolittle I 've forgotten so much since I 've been in here So much
It did n't work
What was that Doolittle
Ah so many malfunctions why do n't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me Oh well did you try the azimuth clutch
Ah pity pity
Tell me Doolittle how are the Dodgers doing
Doolittle you must tell me one thing
I 'm glad you 've come to talk with me Doolittle It 's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
This
Okay okay I can explain You ever have to do something you really do n't want to
No
Yeah
Bruno 's girlfriend
This wo n't hurt Triple dose of insulin you 'll go into a coma couple minutes you 'll stop breathing and on a busy night the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D Plus it 's way classier than blowin your brains out
Who 's Camille
Ass like your I can see why he 's worried you 'll punk
But the boss knows I always been loyal
I 'm outta Portland Sonrisa did n't want local talent
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell weapon in your hand going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient It 's embarrassing to the professional community is what it is
I 'm hired to do a piece of work my mark goes down and stays down Your 's makes it to the hospital where you then got ta go finish the job Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape
You can hardly blame him the way you 've been taking care of business or should I say not taking care of it
See what you do n't know is you 're already in the last two minutes of your life
Call the skank now or I start redecorating
That 's not why we 're here
Actually that 's not gon na be necessary
I like to keep it professional that 's all
Sooo whattya think Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them we could go on a date Play a little miniature golf or somethin
Yeah
Yeah sure I understand
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is
Now that that 's out of the way You want the woman here 's how it works You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever and I make a call to bring her in
Guess again
Mr Sonrisa saw you on the cameras He wants you to come see him
Move it
Can I say something in my defense
Nothing happened between me and Tia
You did n't tell me you lived with her
Could you give us a moment
Trying to have a relationship with you Max is like standing in a fog bank You know you 're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are
Do you know why I went after Justine
CINDY 'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend Who would take offense to that
CINDY You mean until you showed up
Do n't look down
Unless you wan na end up in jail let me and Kendra handle the cops
Out there
Lem me put some clothes on
It 's a sweep C'mon
What is it
I live here Guess I do n't have to ask what you 're doing here
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact At least I tried
I was crazy about you am crazy about you But you keep everyone at arm 's length like there 's some great big dark something going on that I do n't know It 's just that the more I tried to get close to you the more you pulled away
Why would I be pissed
What 're you lookin at me for I 'm not his next of kin Anyway I do n't got that kind of cash lyin around
It concerns only Jah But in this case I was the instrument of the Most High
Like de prophets say Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift wrapped underpants to another woman
Nobody there to sign for it mon What 's a bruddah s'posed to do ride around all day with the damn package
So Max what do you do with all your money
You 're light a deuce
I 'll make it worth your while
I should n't do this But I got a client lookin to score some fire power Maybe you 'll keep your eyes open for me
I 'll give you seventy-five bucks for it
Which means I got ta fence it for two Who 's got that kinda scrilla lying around these being the worst of the times
What 're you looking for
Same old story Not interested
Must think you 're pretty special laying this on you
Where 'd you clip this
You did n't
What 's with you Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he 's family
What a creep
He 's a mistake I made about six months before you did But do n't feel bad Justine made the same mistake along with Renee Jada Tia Brooke
Thanks it 's starting to kick in I feel almost human
Hang on Lauren We 're conferencing in Sophy
Look we got ta keep the momentum up here not give her a chance to think If she hears her kid 's voice
What else can we do
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy would you make sure she 's okay
Can you help me get her back
I could n't get to her It all happened so fast Logan had her and I saw him fall then Peter told me to run And then he and I remember so clearly thinking it 's me they want If I run maybe they 'll come after me Maybe they wo n't think about her So I ran
They took my daughter
SHHH Do n't do that
There 's nothing to be afraid of Everything 's going to be alright
Soon baby
Do n't worry I 'm coming to get you
Sophy Are you okay
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying But things will be better when we move to a new place
What makes you cry
No
Because we ca n't There 's nothing here for us anymore
I know Honey but just think how exiting it will be new house new school new friends
Goodnight Bears Goodnight chairs Goodnight kittens Goodnight mittens Goodnight clocks And goodnight socks Goodnight little house And goodnight
That was taken nine years ago I.D 'd as Michael Hanover Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins Wyoming for armed robbery He escaped from custody after 4 days Has n't been seen or heard from since
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes But Logan and Max with a song in their hearts are gon na march into battle to keep that from happening
And you still think you can do something to change that
We 're quoting Mom again
And I feel real bad about all that but it does n't mean I need to get involved
Look thank you for this but
Deeds not words I need your help
It turned up on the black market One of my sources thought I might be interested
What 's this
On accounta you Sonrisa did n't get to buy off the jury or kill the judge He 's gone Once and for all It was war Max and you won
I 've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen I just know they do So the job 's to figure out how to deal with the consequences Which you did You took that sonuvabitch out
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule Everything happens like it 's supposed to
Not in any pain the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord
Somebody 's got to
That 's deep But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one ta ta
They 've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way
She 's put her life on the line and her faith in me
So you know the lengths he 'll go to keep her from going public I 'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow They 'll put her in witness protection but if you 're with her the risk of her safety goes way down
She 's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa 's managers You know who Sonrisa is
The woman you met Lauren She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar The real drug was shipped out of the country The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans clinics in the area
Your help
I need to find this technician or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore They would 've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work If I can track down one of them
Like extra virgin olive oil the best of the best
Hardly
A girl
The technical term for you is chimera
How much do you know
How well do you remember the lab
The bar code on your neck Max I know who you are and I know who you 're running from
He was working on something called Project Manticore which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human a warrior an advanced infantry soldier
You did go through my stuff
C'mon Max First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you 're Rocky the flying squirrel Then I found this in your apartment
The other one like you
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones
Expensive gifts surprise late-night visits over-the-top flattery You always come on this strong
Gold leaf art nouveau French early nineteen hundreds I could probably fence this for three or four grand
You need to get out more
You 'd think a guy who 's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl
Yes on all counts
We are not fine
Whoa there Tex We 've been through all this
How 'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo 's probably touched everything I own
Am I s'posed to be grateful
How do I know you did n't
Bent
Completely different situation I steal things in order to sell them For money It 's called commerce But some stranger sneaking into a girl 's bedroom is bent
You got a lotta nerve
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with was n't bad enough but breaking into my apartment
I wo n't be staying
Yeah
You accept the way things are you 're an active participant in making it worse
Something
People had a choice even if they took it for granted And now they do n't
Look around at all this Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared They blinked and before they knew it they 'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands Overnight the government the police everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them
Fortunately my needs are met in that department
One of my sources Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa
Lauren 's not my wife
Too early to tell
Now you know who I am where I live I figured I better find out who I 'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me
Was n't that hard
The one you 're wearing
Can we go somewhere and talk
Logan Cale
We did n't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses eye of Ra protector avenger and destroyer giver of life who lives forever I could keep going
No because it 's the Egyptian goddess Bast
Whoever that is
We 're just a little tense right now It 's okay
You 're lucky I almost pulled the trigger
I was expecting someone else
Thank God
You 're a thief
None
Max something I got no clue where she stays
I need to talk to her
But she does work here
Know where I can find her
I 'm looking for a lady who works here
I understand
Okay okay
Help Lem me go No do n't let me go Help
This is not a place you wan na go
I think you should go now
Big part of loving someone 's being able to forgive them
Well it 's over between you and him We 're getting married next month
And so should you Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you I know all about how you threatened him That if he did n't break it off with me you 'd save him the trouble
Look I do n't know what you want
How do I know you 're telling the truth
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night
Who are you
What do you want
Who is it
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma
Got a pencil
Just do it Five-seven-five-oh eight
I need a favor I need you to trace a number for me
I 'm sorry I could n't come up with something more positive
Your fiance has four previous wives His M.O is to clean 'em out and take off Which is what you oughta do
You 're crazy
Like you said maybe somebody 's tracking one of your investigations
How 's this about me
Here 's your money
I 'll live Regarding your case I 'm afraid I 've come up with some bad news on your fiance Lem me get the file
More money Like I 'm shocked to hear you say that
You were gon na run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks
What about the other kids You get anything on them
She was a nurse She must 've lived near there somewhere near the the clinic There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming
Nothing on Hannah
Then what
He says he got it from a woman Does n't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food no bill of sale or nothing It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped So we do n't get anything on the seller Except I actually managed to find this guy six hours on the phone Say thank you
Sorry I was seven at the time
Right here someplace
You got a punk-ass mouth on you kid
You drive away business roarin in like that
I asked you to keep that thing outside
CINDY I say hang the bastard out to dry let her see him for the heel he is then maybe she 'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain
CINDY Only one I can think of
CINDY So are dogs
CINDY Please
CINDY Friends do n't help other friends cheat
CINDY Unlikely
CINDY You 're actually gon na bail Sketchy out
CINDY Where
CINDY More like a mystery Which is n't bad It 's just kinduv mysterious
CINDY And back at ya Only there 's a part of you that 's I do n't know
CINDY Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right
CINDY How long you and me known each other
CINDY You know what I 'm saying
CINDY Hell yeah There 's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little
CINDY He was just trying to blame you 'cause he 's a slut
CINDY You 're not seriously buying into Darren 's nonsense
CINDY What
I just do n't go in with any expectations
What guys do 'Nother order
CINDY Shame wastin a girl like that on a guy but what 're you gon na do
CINDY Now why ca n't I find a girlfriend like that Brings him lunch everyday thoughtful sweet legs from here to there
At least he did n't swing with your ride
Morning Sunshine
You get it when I get her
She 's gon na want to hear for herself
She 's gon na need to know that her little girl 's alright
I have sincere eyes
I told her it 's just business to you that all you want is a reasonable solution to this You give her daughter back she agrees to leave the country I play the guarantor drive her down to Mexico tonight and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever
Pull the cash
What you gon na put me on your Christmas card list
You 're gon na pay me fifty thousand dollars
Only way you 're ever gon na find out is reincarnation Fact is you are gon na pay me and I am gon na provide you with a service
Right after you change your wardrobe your personality and drop about thirty pounds
Not right now
Yeah I can see to it your winning streak continues
Tell everybody hey
What if he 's on the level
I know what I got Max They put me back on that drug they 're giving the other vets Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff 's no good
Feel like the dog 's dinner
You 're the best Maxie
Shut-up
Say the words I understand
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish And if I ever find out you 're going out the back door on Natalie again you 're the one who 's gon na be hanging by your ankles three stories up Understand
None of this would 've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint which you did n't
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she 's the villain in the piece You are
Lydia may not have been one of humanity 's finer specimens but
Easy Sketchy
You do n't
I 'll give it my best shot
And we 're sure Lydia 's gon na make her move
How 'd you get her out of town
Or I dissolve into an angry hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again which is probably what would really happen
a philandering pig
You set up on Lydia When she 's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie
Look Max I made a terrible mistake One I 'll never ever make again Natalie and I are soulmates I know that now She 's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that
Even if she does n't dump me which is unlikely she 'd never be able to trust me again
Who either does n't care or could have me killed Either way Natalie 's still gon na find out
She 's as much as said so But she does n't want to share her toy with anyone else It 's just an ego thing with her
I 'm a toy to her
Lydia
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie Now this person 's demanding I blow her off or she 'll do it for me by telling Nat about us
Exactly
Hear me out This person I 've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married
I 'm the victim here
But there 's another side
Lame self-serving arrogant guilty as charged
Max
I know what you 're thinking But the truth is this other person is not someone I 'm in love with As a matter of fact after what she just did she 's not even someone I like much So in a technical sense I 'm not sure you could call me and her cheating officially
Not half as pissed as she 's gon na be when she finds out why I blew her off I need your help Max
What 's up
Hey Sketchy
Right the big one-oh
Quitting time Grab a cold one
Catch you back at the wall
Hot run to 842 Beulah corner of Haight And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired Not that he cares but the wife and kid might
What about this
Fourteen-thirteen Market Get a signature then take it to this address By the way that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already
You tell Theo he 's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job
For a change
And Theo ca n't pick up his own check because
More like deployed in bed asleep
I want you on call here
This is a hot run Beat it You 're late
Amanda as ironic as this is gon na sound I ca n't take any money for I 'm no Midnight Cowboy y'know It would only cheapen the whole deal for me
He 's a little spoiled but I know he does
More than anything in the world
I just told you he 's a big hairy
Believe it or not you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband the champion of lousy lovemaking The man who thinks he 's the biggest and the best The man who thinks every secretary stewardess and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor The man for whom faking it was invented Christ if I had n't gotten pregnant with our son I would have never known I even had sex with the prick
My name 's not Woody it 's Haw-haw
Who 's Whiskey Dick
Whoa Some of this hard liquor 's a tad too manly for me I 'm a brewski man myself
What the hell is that
Huh
Right well thanks for the drinks and stuff Amanda but there 's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore
Thanks miss
I-I c-ca n't
Oh Dicky I c-c-ca n't
Whoa she is a killer
Sure I have But not one with ice in it that 's all
What 's that
You kidding This is Detroit Drink
Pick a song Hawk
You 're a little scrawny but thanks to the concert we 're low on amateurs Name

Let 's not think about the past Let 's just think about from today on I 'll never forget you Jam
That 'd be great Hey maybe someday your band 'll play there It 's a college town you know
Ann Arbor is n't that far from Cleveland right
Ann Arbor
Peter Criss is my inspiration man If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo I 'd consider it money Hey how 'd you know that
I dunno I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther I 'm not too up on Gene trivia
Oh screw it
We 've got to take this slow
Beth I ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how I 've always felt about you Call me Jam It 's my band name
I do n't care I wan na hear more
Believe it
Yeah
It 's okay
Thanks
Whatever stella
You got in the car did n't you

Oh great I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads I 'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno Mind droppin me there
Any luck
One more time in English
Brilliance Trip Sheer brilliance Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize
So maybe we got enough for one ticket Fuck
I have one question How could a kid who wails on the drums like it 's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say
What was that D.J 's name again
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing I would n't dance like that in private if you paid me
What 's in Sandusky
Totally All I 've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know Just had to make it a little more complicated so he 'd understand
Well the least we his only buds in the world can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence
Namely
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit but we 're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this
Yeah
Nah Could n't be
Tickets
Still too risky for my money We 're running out of time here This is KISS A victory for one is a victory for the team I 'm sure I can barter with a scalper but if you dudes think you got better plans go for it We 'll reconvene at that intersection
Four dudes sneaking in We 'd get busted fer sure Bad plan
Okay shut the fuck up Lex Now then step number one we find us a scalper I got twenty-five
Cool bro now listen up
Now listen up Here 's the game plan
Here 's a suggestion Let 's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation
Now there 's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood
The paint
Lex am I gon na have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit Do n't worry these babies are built for speed
Next stop the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City
Gim me a second dudes Lem me think
Wait a minute We ditching the rest of school
Curly
Well Jam is in absolute trouble He could n't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse 's ass You know as well as me he 'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss 's drum solo never mind a whole KISS concert check
There 's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just does n't matter anymore Lex You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero
Sunday but
Hawk all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati
We are not stealing my mom 's car
But but St Bernard 's is way the hell over in the next county
Too bad we 're stuck in electronics or
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life
I 've been in love with her since the second grade
Check
Okay enough Enough Gim me the tickets I wan na hold onto them
YO DOOFUS
Stellas I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs
Sure
Oh yeah
Excuse me I 'm a little deef-a hearin Can you repeat yourself
No I 'm dumber than a goddamn slug Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado
And if it ai n't cleaned off
Hey disco dude it 's cool
Chief here 's a little secret Drink heavily your feet will know what to do Now shit or get off the pot Do you wan na dance or do you wan na see KISS only on their album covers
Yeah you 're probably too young anyhow
Guess you do n't want to see the greatest show on earth And in Detroit no less Well take care chief
You look a little scrawny but it 's worth a shot
Where the hell am I gon na scare up that kinda gravy in one hour
Dude this is all I got
Go ahead Jam
See you at 8:30 Jam Later Dudes Later
Jam shut-up You 're not allowed to speak remember Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four I do n't wan na hear it
Uh-uh Do n't tell us Jam Just show us
Jam not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth Okay we 're here we got nothing and we got an hour and a half We 're totally committed It 's time to brainstorm
Christine stole it Asleep my ass The stella booted with your mom 's wheels
Please Jam we 're trying to vent some hostility here Sure the whole thing may be your fault but who 's gon na get pissed off at you
Oh I 'm sorry Trip What you made was a big brainless pile of horse shit No offense
Hey Look at the front entrance A car 's pulling out The parking space from heaven God is surely smiling down upon us tonight dudes
It does n't mean anything Do n't pay attention to him
Oh no Jam I 'm not falling for that twice
Do n't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off
If he offers you a slice you 're not the least bit hungry check
All right After school we double time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck 's sake
They 're still at my house in Trip 's jacket
Do n't be a fembot So are you like grounded because of last night or what
Cool
Gone Why would I have the KISS tick
What 's gone
It 's my Bullworker
Just listen up man cause we are in a quandary
Jam listen up
BRUCE Jeremiah what 's gotten into you
Mom what 're we
I said I 'm sorry
If I 'm anything like you I 'll deserve him
BRUCE What else can I do Oh records and magazines and comic books are one thing but tickets TICKETS Jeremiah do you realize what this means That you 're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces Now you want to see the devil in the flesh You want to reach out and touch pure evil and in Detroit no less
BRUCE I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St Bernard 's We 're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot
Grounded for the rest of the year
They 're not idiots
But mom
Change What 's wrong with what I got on
Ahh sunshine
BRUCE Jeremiah what are you doing
Oh hi mom
Tell you what You keep guessing and I 'll say something when you get it
No Much bet I mean much more sinful than that
Okay when she peeled off that gown you 'll never guess what she was wearing underneath
Well she was a very tempting siren Father Built like you would n't believe So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour
I was insulted so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o right Then she said no she wanted to take a bath with me
Alright Father here it is About two weeks ago I went to my cousin 's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath
Well then I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets I realize this is Detroit but I personally find what that rock and roll band is all about to be boring as Lucifer 's kingdom I 'll return in a little while
Well this is a unique confession to say the least son And not exactly the most interesting one I 've ever heard either You sure you do n't want to talk about oh carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad 's bed
That 's it
Just one Father but boy was it a doozy
Forgive me Father for I have sinned This is my first confession in well a really long time
Twenty-five more n I got
Damn she musta hot wired it We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John
I can see that bright boy What happened to it
Fuck you Lex This whole thing would n't have happened if it was n't for you jinxing us I just made an honest mistake
Let 's lift up her shirt
Trip huck that out before it stains the upholstery
Huh St Bernard 's Figures it 's named after a canine
Hello summer detention
Simple-icity is more like it And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before Wait till Mrs Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us
Yeah I have a saying too Lex It goes Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us asshole We 're going this time and that 's all there is to it
We won
Smug Trip Not snug smug
Trip it 's not the end of the world okay Quit acting all squeezed out
Hey take it easy man This is the girls crapper remember
I knew it I knew this was gon na happen I had a bad feeling since last night Remember We are so totally fucked
That 's some sick shit right there Did she comb your ass hair for you too
Yeah right She wishes Look at that big ass
Trip you fuckin asshole
Trip a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make And even if it did at least my mom did n't give birth to me while she was on LSD
Poor Jam man Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers No question Mrs Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us
KID You heard me nad breath My time 's precious and I think that 's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life
KID Say Chongo perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend wo n't be attending
KID It 's not nearly enough punk
KID A tag on your toe Nobody threatens me and lives
KID Do n't try to run maggot Chongo 's an all-state track star in every event
KID No really My brother 's hanging onto it for safe keeping Please let me get him for you
KID Please sir do n't beat me up I do have a KISS ticket but not on me
WITH COAT I do n't even think you have a gun

'S VOICE I did
'S VOICE Yeah
'S VOICE Gene Klein Stanley Eisen Paul Frehley and Peter Criscula Yeah that 's it
'S VOICE Hello Is this me I 'm Trip Am I on the air
CUNNINGHAM Now that 's what I like to hear Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears They give in to their feelings of self-doubt they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs alcohol and premarital sex Empty solutions These are toxic chemicals and disease-spreading behaviour
CUNNINGHAM Are you AFRAID
CUNNINGHAM Now that 's better but I still sense some students out there who are AFRAID just to say GOOD MORNING
CUNNINGHAM That 's all the gusta you can musta I said Good morning
CUNNINGHAM Good morning mongrels
Yeah
Donnie Donnie Darko
He got smooshed By a jet engine
Horrible accident My neighbour he got killed
MONNITOFF Donnie I 'm afraid I ca n't continue this conversation I could lose my job
MONNITOFF You are contradicting yourself Donnie If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies The very fact that this choice exists would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end
MONNITOFF I 'm not following you
MONNITOFF That is highly unlikely You 're talking about an act of God
MONNITOFF Uhh sure And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal in this case the wormhole or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered
MONNITOFF Beg pardon
MONNITOFF Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time along its centre of gravity
Well the thing is nobody remembers their infancy And anyone who says they do is lying We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life
MONNITOFF A metal craft of any kind
MONNITOFF The basic principles of time travel are there So you have the vessel and the portal And the vessel can be anything Most likely a spacecraft
MONNITOFF A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man
MONNITOFF Theoretically
MONNITOFF So according to Hawking wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time
MONNITOFF Donnie
Donnie Give it back
You 'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal
I 'm telling Mom
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie He stinks
When can I squeeze one out
What did you say
You know what I think that you did it
That 's not what I heard Now they think I did it
Did you tell them that I flooded the school
How much longer is this gon na last
Why do they call you Frank
What happened to your eye
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit
You have a request
I want to show you something
Where did you come from
Who is we
Why did you make me flood the school
How can you do that
What 'd you do Donnie What 'd you do
How old is Grandma Death
My dad said he found you on the golf course Are you sleepwalking again
DARKO CHEATS DEATH Man you 're famous I called you like a jillion times last night
Is that a cellar door
No Frank
Time is running out We have to go see Grandma Death We have to talk to her
Come with me
What
I 'm so scared I just keep thinking that something awful has happened It 's my fucking stepdad I know it
Did you call the cops
I do n't know She did n't leave a note The house is all messed up
My mom is gone
Hey
Not now Donnie It is n't a good time
What do you mean
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge
What How long was I asleep
Yeah So the idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant and they wear them at night when they sleep
So we call them IMGs
I know she 's here She never leaves the house
Oh yeah The Philosophy of Time Travel What is this
Who
Are you okay
What
Yeah And right now there 's some fat guy over there watching us
No Donnie wait I 've never
You want to kiss me
And what
Like a Hawaiian sunset the Grand Canyon Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be
That 's not good enough You 've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them with whatever you wanted
Babies cry because they 're afraid of the dark And because they have no memories for all they know every night could be the last forever Like perpetual darkness
What happened to your neck
Why
Yeah
And you 'd never been there before
So when you sleepwalk you go somewhere familiar
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker because they could drop dead
So when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward Like do you dream
Where are you going
No I mean will you GO with me That 's like what they call it here Going together
Will you go with me
I 'm sorry
We never would have had this conversation
It 's a good thing the school was flooded today
The best thing about soap is that it 's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty No matter what crap you throw on it it always rubs off And there it is again perfect
Do n't knock soap Without it disease would spread rapidly If we ran out you and I would never live to see the year 2000
I mean the whole sanitation thing Joseph Lister 1895 Before antiseptics there was no sanitation especially in medicine
I should go For physics Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind
Donnie Darko is a cool name Sounds like a superhero
He fled They still ca n't find him My mom and I had to change our names and stuff I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest
Yeah My parents got divorced My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad He has emotional problems
Fuck them
Do n't look so freaked
Wan na walk me home
Hey
FARMER If you do n't complete the assignment you 'll get a zero for the day
Well yeah OK but you 're not listening to me There are other things that need to be taken into account here Like the whole spectrum of human emotion You 're just lumping everything into these two categories and like denying everything else
Well life is n't that simple So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet That has nothing to do with either fear or love
I just do n't get this Everything ca n't be lumped into two categories That 's too simple
I 'm sorry Ms Farmer I just do n't get this
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son
Do you get to meet Ed
Fine You know Dr Thurman is n't so bad a lady I can tell her anything
That is a terrible nickname
Then why do n't you start taking the goddamn pills
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade Mom Get out of my room
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table
When did you stop taking your medication
No a year of partying is enough She 'll be going to Harvard this fall
I know I 'm not the best communicator But whatever happens in your life whatever obstacles you come up against you just say and do whatever is in your heart You be honest and tell the truth even if they look at you funny and they will They 'll tell you that you 're wrong They 'll call you a fool But what you 've got to understand son is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit and they 're scared of people like you Because you 're smarter than all of them
You 're my only son
Who 's been giving you weird looks
You 're right Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time Over the years as she got older she became more and more of a recluse now she just likes to stay up there all by herself
Grandma Death
Oh shit
So we 're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows
Where it came from
Do they know yet
It was great We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime And then during show-and tell my stuffed walrus was a big hit
POMEROY Then go find her Donnie Do n't let her get away She was right about the rabbits Go
POMEROY So will Donnie find his Cellar Door
Cellar door
What 's Cellar Door
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you
That 's bullshit You 're a good teacher
Where are you going
Ms Pomeroy what 's going on
POMEROY Is the death of one species less tragic than another
POMEROY Because the rabbits are us Donnie
POMEROY And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver 's vision do they believe him It could be the death of an entire way of life the end of an era
POMEROY Who is Frank
POMEROY Donnie Darko perhaps given your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion
Goodbye Dr Thurman
Thank you
THURMAN You will survive this Donald I promise you that you will survive You must let me help you And when I clap my hands together you will wake up
THURMAN If the sky were to suddenly open up there would be no law there would be no rule There would only be you and your memories the choices you 've made and the people you 've touched The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged by which you must judge yourself Because when this world ends there will only be you and him and no one else
THURMAN Where is he Donald
THURMAN Who is he going to kill
THURMAN What is going to happen
THURMAN When will this happen
THURMAN Then how is time travel possible
THURMAN How is that possible
THURMAN Where are we going Donald
I think so I think that 's one of the clues It 's a clue that tells us to keep going
Because I 'm so horny
I think now that he might
I have to obey him because he saved my life He controls me and I have to obey him or I 'll be left all alone and I 'll never figure out what all of this means
Yes I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert 's house I think I only have a few days left before they catch me
That I did it again
Regret
Hungry Hungry Hippos
They did n't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year

TEASDALE The king can do no wrong
You satisfied your selfish whims while nations tottered dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion Not bad eh
THIS IS TREASON What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms
Do n't bother me I 'm thinking What was that
WHAT
That 's all right I 'll fix you right up
Take a seat you 're next
You can call me Gloria too Gloria what a beautiful name When I was born my mother named me Gloria two minutes later she found out her mistake
Gloria may I call you Gloria

Guard them with your life do n't leave them out of your sight If the enemy gets those papers we 're lost If they do n't get them we 're lost Ca n't you see what I 'm trying to tell you I love you Mrs Teasdale you 're the salt of the earth They do n't come any better than you
TEASDALE Oh wo n't you reconsider
TEASDALE But Your Excellency the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit He came to ask you to patch up the breach
I would n't know what to say either if I was in your place Maybe you can suggest something
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head
He did I told my son not to leave it laying around Where is son
I wrote a speech last night that 'll knock them off their seats Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
That 's what I get for dressing in a hurry
These are the laws of my administration No one 's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke And whistling is forbidden
Well a gal a day is enough for me I could n't handle any more
You 're not so bad yourself Mrs Teasdale when I look at you I can see that we 're facing a crisis We 've got to balance the budget we 've got to cut down everything including you
No wonder he passed away I 'd like to be with you to the very end Ca n't you see what I 'm trying to tell you I love you
I have n't been on the job five minutes and already she 's making advances to me Not that I care but where is your husband

You can keep it I 've got a whole pack Now what were you saying
For you I would do anything
Mrs Teasdale I 'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency
I shall report this indignity the my President Mrs Teasdale I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war
TEASDALE Gentlemen Gentlemen
TEASDALE Well no not exactly but
TEASDALE Ambassador Trentino I am indeed honored But you see well I
Mrs Teasdale no matter who rules Freedonia to me you will always be the first lady of the land
What is money Mrs Teasdale for you I would do anything
Perhaps he will listen to you
Maybe you can still win the old dame over why not try to
I thought everything was working out fine
It is every woman 's problem Who supplies the sons the brothers the husbands Who
Uncle you ca n't do this
Maybe it 's not going to be so easy From what I 've heard Mrs Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T Firefly
So that 's the one you want to marry
Oh no Mr Merrick No No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment
Oh why Mr Merrick she 's beautiful
I 've always thought that myself
How lovely
Oh
Two please
Yes please two
Oh Frederick
Frederick just what is it that you are saying
Oh that 's absurd Frederick No no Frederick that 's all wrong John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life And that is completely due to you
Oh Freddie What could that wretched vampire say to upset you
Freddie What 's the matter You 've been like this all evening
More romances for John
You stay with me
Yes
John loves the house
Well these things take time
I 'm sure I do n't know Freddie
Perhaps you 're just polishing a stone endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he does n't possess
Frederick why are you so interested in this particular case
But I thought you said that he was rather simple
What do you mean
Freddie Freddie do n't look so discouraged
Yes and they send their kisses Would you like your sherry now
Did it go well darling
You wo n't be long
Like this
Our man is sick Come right away
I found it
Excuse me Mr Treves sir
Do n't
What are you going to do
He 's sick Bytes He 's going to die
Aw Bytes he 's sick
Right Right
I 've got my rights damn you and I 'm going to the authorities
I want him back
You think you 're better n me YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself you guv So I gave him to you On trust in the name of science And now I want him back
He 's a freak That 's how they live We 're partners him and I business partners You 're willfully deprivin me of my livlihood
Pull the other one why do n't you We made a deal
DO N'T Do n't muck me about You 've had plenty of time to fix him up and he 's leaving with me NOW Do you understand me Now Mr Treves We had a bargain
Never mind that I want my man
I want my man back
I like doing business with you You and I understand each other completely I know I can trust you Ca n't I
Ca n't you fix him up here He 's my livelihood Listen
That 's the way he sleeps If he lays down he 'll die Head 's too heavy
He 's a clumsy git Never watches where he is going
He fell He falls
I intend to
What do you mean
Steady on Treves Have a seat
Please do
But he 's so afraid he 's going to be carted off I 've promised him that wo n't happen
Has the response picked up
No we do n't Their committees have informed me that they 're unwilling to take Mr Merrick even if they were supplied with funds They do n't want him
Of course they will They 're reasonable men
Excellent We shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee I want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities
No not that way Broadneck and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly It makes them queasy Do you have any photographs of Mr Merrick
You are quite right Treves this is an exceptional case And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr Merrick
Yes I think I can
Not me sir Mr Merrick He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness
Tell me John how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm
How did you know the rest I never taught you the rest of it
Yes I 'm very sorry to have wasted your time sir I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him
And what was that John
Fine fine You know your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing Treves But you must remember that this is a hospital and there are many patients here Patients who can be made well and you owe them your first consideration Just do n't become so obsessed old man that you begin to neglect them
He need n't I have no desire to cause him any discomfort Did you make those inquiries we spoke about
Speaking is one thing Treves but can the man comprehend
Yes Sir
Wh whatever is most convenient for you sir
Thank you very much Sir Shall we say in a few days then
Mr Treves it 's out of the question I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do I 'm sorry
No Treves it 's out of the question Now if it was up to me I 'd say Certainly let 's meet the fellow by all means I 'm sorry I simply ca n't speak for the other members of the committee
I really do n't think that 's necessary Treves I 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are
A few words I thought he was imbecile
Good How is the patient
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital
I certainly sympathize with your problem Treves Why do n't you try the British Home or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him
Oh is he a friend of yours
What are your plans then Treves You are aware that the London does not accept incurables The rules are quite clear on that point
Deformed Is that it Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable
Why is n't he in the General Ward then
A hospital is no place for secrecy Mr Treves Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment Why was n't this patient properly admitted and why is he in isolation Is he contagious
Do n't be frightened He wo n't hurt you
It 's quite nutritious sir
Good morning sir
I hope we can talk together again sometime Good day
It was a great pleasure to meet you Mr Merrick
What is it Treves
everyone has been very kind
I everyone has been very kind to me
Are you comfortable here
I 'm feeling very fit thank you How is your bronchitis
How are you feeling today
You never mentioned his mental state
I do n't know what I 've got
You 'll know presently At the meeting of the society But until then I beg of you Fox keep it to yourself
Oh nothing nothing of any great importance
What a mess
Mmmm Hodges Pierce come closer Mr Hill take hold of the rope please It 's a machine accident I expect you 'll be seeing a good deal of this
How long has this man been here
Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits
O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies
Pardonnez-moi I can not tell vat is like me
Your majesty shall mock at me I can not speak your England
Oh no no you 're a Romeo
Why Mr Merrick you 're not an Elephant Man at all
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
No but I certainly shall
That 's one thing the theatre has in great store which reminds me I have something else for you
It 's very difficult to put into a nutshell but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world to any time you desire You may look over the shoulders of kings unobserved battle with ruthless tyrants and marry the beautiful princess all in the space of a few hours Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be do anything you please and always always live happily ever after The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world Mr Merrick It is lights and music gaiety and joy It 's well it 's romance
Well you must go It is one of the most beautiful places on earth Of course I 'm rather partial
You 've never been
Oh no Mr Merrick I just work there
Yes
Oh no I would never think it It 's so beautiful You are so I 'll give it a place of honor here next to my mother
I knew you 'd understand Here
I 've brought you some things I hope you 'll like Mr Merrick I hope you do n't think it too forward
Yes
Yes There is nothing more frustrating nothing that makes a physician feel more useless than standing by watching his patient deteriorate And when that patient is a friend no no there 's absolutely nothing I can do
And yet not once have any of us heard him complain
I fear not Mrs Kendal Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly as is his pain
I 'm very grateful to you Mrs Kendal This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal John will be very excited
Good day Mr Merrick
DWARF You know I saw you once there in London You 're a great attraction
DWARF Say hello to London for me I miss her
DWARF I 'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket but it 's all we had
Yes
You 're English
y-y-yes
Yes well good day Mr Merrick
I learned a long time ago
The main spire
It 's alright it was thrown away No one wants it It 's just that it 's a little dirty that 's all
The hallway Oh the wastecan
Thank you very much
Yes
Good morning
No nothing
Thank you very much
Feeling better now Mr Merrick
Goodnight John Sleep well
Then I should n't change anything
Mr Treves tell me tell me truly Is it alright did I make any mistakes that you can see
I 'm glad John Goodnight
Splendid it 's truly a masterpiece Well I suppose I 'll be on my way now I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening
Will the cathedral be finished soon John
Oh no I could n't
John how can you ever forgive me
Mr Treves Thank you my friends
Oh Mr Treves Mr Treves
There is one more thing John Here
Please please thank the governing committee for me I will do my utmost to merit their kindness
You did this for me
my home
You want a dressing bag John
Oh no There is nothing I have everything you have given me everything I could possibly want I am happy every hour of the day I only wish there was something I could give to you
Yes soon I will start the main spire but I must finish these columns first How kind of her
I thought as much
Can you cure me
Mr Treves there is something I 've been meaning to ask you for some time
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting When will the heart be aweary of beating and nature die
Good morning
Here
Would you would you like to see my mother
Oh they 're gone for the day with friends
Of course
Oh our relatives the children
Oh yes
Not at all John
How is your tea John
That 's a canopy John
I 'm not used to such kindness From a beautiful woman
When one is invited to tea one must look one 's best
You look splendid John
How long will I stay here
The hospital
This is my new home
Good evening Very well thank you And you
We do have a lot to talk about do n't we
I never thought to ask How can you ever forgive me
Why did you let me go on like that teaching you what you already knew Why did n't you tell me you could read
Yes potatoes but
Mr Merrick likes the food here Do n't you John
John may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm
Very good very good Now when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you 've learned If you have any trouble with any of the words I 'll help you I 'm sure you 'll be just fine If you do as well for him as you 've done for me these last two days then I 'm sure our visitor will be very pleased Now let 's go through the whole thing again shall we I will say May I introduce you to Mr Carr Gomm And you will say
Righteousness
Hello my name is John Merrick
Hello my name is John Merrick
Mmmerrick
Mmmerrick
Merrick
John Merrick
My name is
Hello
Yes
Yes
Yyess
Yyes
Yyyy Yyye yyyess
So you see John there 's no need for a lighthouse All your friends are here
Well
A dressing bag
Very smart indeed
Yes sir What 's that
Mr Treves some more books arrived for Mr Merrick
I bathed him did n't I I fed him and cleaned up after him If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern then yes I did treat him with loving kindness and I 'm not ashamed to say it
But you saw them sir They could n't hide their disgust They do n't care anything for John they 're just trying to impress their friends
I ca n't understand why you let those people go in there sir
Excuse me sir I 'd like to have a word with you
I regret that I must leave you here m Lord m Lady Thank you so much for coming It was an act of the greatest charity
I 'm sure that if Mr Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they 'd see that he 's the exception to their rule Now I 'm not expecting miracles I 'm not saying he 'll be able to read or write but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself I 'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now That was very good John very good That 's all for today We shall do some more tomorrow Mothershead
We 've made tremendous strides today Mothershead He listens and repeats with great attention and this certainly is n't easy for him
Perhaps you 've got the time for that Mr Treves I certainly do n't I 've got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients Do n't waste your time with him sir it 's like talking to a wall I do n't mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him I 'll be back later for his bath And Mr Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment Good day sir
Just being obstinate sir I 'll handle it
Wo n't come out eh
Good morning Mr Treves It 'll be his bath-time soon Has he eaten
The workhouse
Sir you do n't have to worry about me I 'm not the sort to cry out Shall we go in
I 've heard
Fine
YOU 'RE THE MONSTER YOU 'RE THE FREAK GET OUT YOU 'RE FINISHED
YOU BASTARD You tortured him YOU TORTURED HIM you bastard WHERE is HE
HE 'S GONE
Do n't lie to me I know all about it You were SEEN Where did you take him
WHERE IS MR MERRICK
Bytes Mr Bytes He 'll be there
Never mind I 'm the owner
Handsomely Who sent you
I do n't think so No sir we 're closed
And who might you be sir
ARNULF Well my dear I think you 'll find it 's all a question of what you want to believe in I have slightly more experience of these matters than you
But Father it IS
ARNULF But one day I 'll catch you Like I caught her
ARNULF She did I tell you She could blind me as easily as the night the day
ARNULF I do n't know how you do it Aud I sometimes think you 've got some of your mother 's magic
You 're losing your temper
There 's nobody here Father Look for yourself
There IS no one
Who Father
ARNULF Open up I know you 're in there
ARNULF Open up I know you 're in there
I do n't want to live WITHOUT you
Then I shall come too
There is something I must ask the Gods
Not quite
The second note to wake the Gods
Then let go
You do n't have to love me Just do you believe I love YOU
Do you believe I love you
YOU still want to go to Asgaard
No Do n't look The abyss will suck away your strength
No No We are in the spell of the Horn Hatred will destroy us
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible
But you do n't realize
Erik You do n't understand
No
Where 's the Cloak Invisible
Just give me a hand
Halfdan the Black
We must n't let him land
You 're as bad as my father
That 's just what I was trying to tell you You ARE
Oh for goodness sake
The Cloak Invisible It was my mother 's parting gift
I 've never LOVED anybody
Why do you go on about that What does it matter
But you LOVED her all the same
What was she like
What does that matter But you 've you 've FELT like this before
No I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you 'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams
No of course not silly I mean FELT like this about them
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else
Yes
Put them down PLEASE make them put them down
PLEASE You do n't know what you 're doing
These What are THESE They 're swords
What are what
Well EVERYONE is friends here on Hy Brasil
Well of course We always welcome friends
I said welcome
SHE blew the Horn Resounding
How do we know this is the way
But How is it you can see me You can all see me
But
LOKI Where did YOU come from
And will the dead ever return Freya
The Gods are asleep Erik
The sky WAS blue Erik once
But have you ever seen it Think back
Have you ever seen the sun Erik
It is day of course Freya
I see the world
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman 's stories
Now what CAN you want with me Erik the Viking
But it IS Look
Yes oh yes
Oh No No of course not it 's just I had n't expected it to be quite so big
ARNULF I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years and will keep it for the next thousand
ARNULF Not when we explain about the Great Blessing
ARNULF Do n't talk nonsense
ARNULF Why
They 'll be more than hurt if Halfdan the Black lands Ow
You 've got to let me go
Yes
ARNULF YOU try to be nice to people when they 're rude about your singing
ARNULF Well how d'you think I feel
ARNULF They did n't like it Oh God I want to die
ARNULF Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY totally genuinely honest with me Did you really truly honestly like it
ARNULF We 're just not a very musical nation
No
Really
Of course we 're not we 'd genuinely like to hear you sing
Er well we we would be TERRIBLY grateful if you all would sing for us
ARNULF But you do n't want to hear it
ARNULF A lot of people like our singing
ARNULF You do n't think our singing 's going to be good enough for you
ARNULF What 's the matter do n't you WANT to hear our singing
ARNULF Would you like us to sing to you
Well OBVIOUSLY there 's no killing
How
No we do n't
Why should you care
You 'll have to wait till he 's finished his game
Well no
I 'll ask the Gods to give you life again
Why
I 've come to take you back to the land of the living
Why should YOU care
I dunno you looked so so vulnerable
Oh that 's all right then it 's the thought that counts
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death
Aaagh Rape
Ah
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on
Well you started it
But that 's a circular argument If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out
Why Why have you got to go round killing and looting
What about the killing and looting That 's just as crude is n't it
You DO N'T like it do you
About raping me
What d'you expect You come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me
What
Oh get it over with
What rape
You do n't love ME
Sh
Shut up
Yes
Me Of course I 've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast
Do n't you FEEL it
I know I know
He wants to KILL us
Halfdan the Black 's here
That 's terrible
What 's wrong with making friends
Let 's hack her to pieces
How deep IS the ocean
Erik Row What are you doing
It 's Halfdan the Black
What are you talking about
Nothing Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night
But
Find it AND cross it
That 's my boy
So What 'd you do to her
It 's always the women that start the trouble
Who have you been talking to
You talking piffle son
What
We 're missing all the fun
Faster
Slower In Out
Slower Nobody can row at that speed
I want to die No I do n't
He can have my place I do n't want to go anyway
'S DAD What did he say
'S DAD What magic have you brought Erik
What magic
'S DAD The sun That 's it
ROW
Shut up You there You there and you there
'S DAD You may need a real Berserk
Look Erik
Erik the Viking The things you seek are not in our power We do n't make men love each other or hate each other
So
Why should WE care
We do n't HAVE to help anybody
No Arrgh
I 've got you
Oh I feel a little oh
To the oars
Like fish
Well come on
Has anyone told him we 've got a dragon eating our boat
Now you 've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other
Now you 've got all the big ones on one side
You ca n't have Sven 's father sitting next to Sven They 'll argue the whole time
Leif you sit there Even you sit there Harald you 'd better sit over there
Now stop it
No We 'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods
No do n't say anything else
I think we should go
Just say something cheerful
Oh er yes
Nobody gets killed
There is another way
Do n't you see Erik She wants revenge
So Halfdan the Black 's using magic is he Well I have a magic to match his
Well what else do we do
And you Keitel Blacksmith
What do you think
Bjorn 's not He could have Bjorn 's place
Wait Erik
I came to find my grandfather
Sven
We must blow the first note he note that will take us to Asgaard
Hy-Brasil
She has n't got any
ROW
I AM one Dad
Well what difference does it make where you 're SITTING
It does n't matter WHERE you sit
I was sitting there
I do n't know but I 'm not afraid to try
We 'd be the first
What 's the matter Are you afraid to try
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge
I will join my grandfather there
Please
What d'you expect me to do
Yeah well
Bye Leif
'S DAD He has n't
'S DAD Do what
Nothing I just immerse you in water
It ca n't do you any HARM
What 's all the panic about
Quite MY lord said The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick
You know my son our lord said
Same thing is n't it
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson 's wife You converted HER
You 're wasting your time
You coming You do n't even believe in Asgaard
Oh Who cares We 're HOME
That 's it AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory
That 's it
Bastard
Look I do n't feel BAD about it I just feel ILL
I know I know
How can you help feeling bad when you 're sea-sick
No I 'm not
Hang on
I 've got you Keitel Blacksmith If you go I go too
What are you talking about
Got you
What have you got there
What are you doing Keitel Blacksmith
Oh
Who 's that
Well Come on
By YOU Keitel Blacksmith Do n't you know Erik that is why he went with you Ragnarok was good for his business
Like you got rid of Snorri
You fool
You 've lost your mind
Keep your mouth shut Keitel
Shut up
Help
Help
I 'm drowning Help
I ca n't swim I ca n't swim
YOU do it
How can we stops him now
Well I I thought
You ca n't let Erik do THAT
Honour and protect all blacksmiths
That 's right
It 's not just YOUR livelihood that 's at stake but your son 's and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths
The Age of Ragnarok ends
But Keitel if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding if he ever crosses Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge if he ever wakens the gods
Ca n't make enough swords
Yes yes of course the Blacksmith 's Code
You just ca n't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand You could charge Halfdan twenty and he 'd pay it
Yes it is good But I told him ten
'S DAD I hate you I hate you
'S DAD And his you 'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper
'S DAD He drove me mad
There is nothing we can do
'S DAD Well go on Go berserk
'S DAD There THAT 'S a true Berserk
Well of course he is
'S DAD HOLD it HOLD it in
KILL KILL
I must KILL Kill
We 're being attacked KILL Kill Kill
'S DAD You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle
'S DAD But it 's a responsibility being a Berserk
'S DAD So did my father and his father before him
'S DAD I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald
'S DAD I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair
'S DAD It 's a tradition
No he 's not not there
I 'm not frightened of anything
Erik 's right We 'll all meet in Valhalla
Me too
Neither am I
You liar
I never do
Yes Mother Goodbye Dad
No Mother
Yes Mum
Yes Mother
No one
I told you that later
This is the night you met Clementine Joel I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought oh shit
I did You said things were fine
Just a little overworked maybe
Say hi to Naomi
I hope you feel better sweetie
Sweetie we called the company
You were n't supposed to see that
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on Just make a clean break
I do n't know honey It 's horrible
No it was lovely
And I just liked you so much
But I thought I do n't know I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it
Shit The last time I saw you
Okay I guess
Hi
Yes please have a seat He 'll be right with you
May I help you
What 's wrong with me
I did n't have a chance to wrap it
I 'm so excited Yay
Um okay I 'll call my study partner
Sure We 'll go next weekend and
Nothing makes any sense Nothing makes any sense
I do n't know I 'm lost I 'm scared I feel like I 'm disappearing I 'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me
In the world
It 's so cool You 're by far the most sensational person in the room
You rat
Come over after I 'm done here
You were not
I think I know I think we can help Why do n't you start by telling me about your relationship Everything you can think of Everything about him Everything about you And we 'll take it from there
What No I do n't like the term boyfriend It 's so gay
Well I 've been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend I guess
Okay I guess
I just wanted to say that Come by my house
Yay Meet me after work by the old mill
You 're still excited by my irreverence You have n't yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock
I sort of do But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality Cleaned up enough to be erotic
Says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
I do n't know
Says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
That 's what it says You drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
Says you were a bully
I 'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you
Yeah I would n't have thought that
and I 'm just too nervous around you right now
I 'm sorry I just wanted to say that This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
Have sex Y'know
Listen did you want to make love
I think I should go back
I do n't know What if it breaks
Do n't worry It 's really solid this time of year
Tonight Just to test out the phone lines
When
So you 'll call me right
Bye Joel
I walked out the door There 's no more memory
I did I walked out the door I felt like I was a scared little kid I thought you knew that about me I ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation You said so go with such disdain
No it 's our house Just tonight we 're David and Ruth Laskin Which one do you want to be I prefer to be Ruth but I 'm flexible Alcohol You make drinks I 'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth I 'm ruthless at the moment
Ah-ha Now I can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet
Yeah What 's your girlfriend 's name
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi was n't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
I could see you wanted to come in Joel
C'mon man The water 's fine Nobody 's coming here tonight believe me This place is closed up Electricity 's off
What are you doing
At least I have n't been barking up the wrong tree
Male or female
I do sort of live with somebody though
Um no
Yes I love that poem It breaks my heart I 'm so excited you know it Look houses in which we do n't live
Do you know her poem that starts Seaside gusts of wind And a house in which we do n't live
Seems too coincidental that way
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
I think she 's great
I love her
Okay
yeah
I do n't think I 've slept in a year
I know what you mean That 's why I stopped
Enjoy it Say good-bye
I know
Nope No jokes My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll I think your name is magic
You mean like Oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin Clementine Huckleberry Hound That sort of thing
Oh God how horrid
I 'm Clementine Can I borrow a piece of your chicken
Yeah I know I 'm fishing
Even then I did n't believe you entirely I thought how could you be talking to me if you could n't talk to people
Yeah I do n't ever know what to say
You said
Hi there
It would be different if we could just give it another go around
I still thought you were going to save me Even after that
You had the whole human race pegged
I remember that speech really well
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we 'll talk again
Look man I 'm telling you right off the bat I 'm high maintenance So I 'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there If you want to be with me you 're with me
Well you 're married
Yeah
I did n't think you 'd show your face around me again I figured you were humiliated You did run away after all
Is that what you want
Yes exactly Exactly my point
Come up and see me now
And I did n't have an argument
I thought I was foolish I thought I 'd mistaken infatuation for love You said
But you were n't I could tell
I said Are you sure You seem unsure
I 'll buy that Black 's always good
No I think you were wearing that black dress y'know with the buttons
God I should know Your hair was red I remember it matched the wallpaper
Yeah
Do you remember what we talked about
I want to enjoy my little time left with you
I 'm done Clem I 'm just going to ride it out Hiding is clearly not working
I scoured the city for it
Happy Birthday
Joel
Look at you cutey What are we doing
They found us before The plan did n't work I do n't know what to do now
Do n't call me Antoine My name is Wally
Gross You must remember to tell me this in the morning I 'm like so freaked out now
Really Is he cute
What
another rainy day Whatever shall we do
You remember what happened next
You know we 're okay They 're not finding us You 'll remember me in the morning And you 'll come to me and tell me about us and we 'll start over
I 'm scared I want my mommy I do n't want to lose you I do n't want to lose
I want my mommy I do n't want to lose you Clem
What do you mean
I do n't know
I hired them to We 're in my brain But I want it to stop before I wake up and do n't know you anymore
Yes indeed Fuck They 're erasing you Clem
It 's my favorite book Since I was a kid It 's about these toys There 's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real I ca n't believe I 'm crying already He says It takes a long time That 's why it does n't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept Generally by the time you are Real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby But these things do n't matter at all because once you are Real you ca n't be ugly except to people who do n't understand
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit
Joely
More
I just do n't have anything very interesting about my life
No it is n't that
You 're a whiz kid So perceptive so
Would you get me another Joely
It 's you It 's you who ca n't commit to anything You have no idea how lucky you are I 'm interested in you I do n't even know why I am I should just end it right here Joel Leave you in the zoo Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with
I 'd make a fucking good mother I love children I 'm creative and smart and I 'd make a fucking good mother
You ca n't fucking say something like that and say you do n't want to talk about it
I do n't want to talk about this here
Clementine do you really think you could take care of a kid
I do n't think we 're ready
Let 's talk about it later
Oh shit I remember this Want to go
Where are you going
Look at it out here It 's falling apart I 'm erasing you And I 'm happy
Let me drive you home
A wino Jesus Are you from the fifties A wino Face it Joel You 're freaked out because I was out late without you and in your little wormy brain you 're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight
I do n't know maybe you did kill somebody
a little I was a little tipsy Do n't call me pathetic
It 's three
You did n't say anything about my hair
Okay
Tomorrow
Yeah
So I enjoyed meeting you
I would like you to call me Would you do that I would like that
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so
Sounds good But right now I should go
Yeah Oh great
I do n't believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things We like the same writers This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to And he 's cute It 's fucked up Joel you should come up to the Charles with me sometime
Exactly I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but I was really disappointment to be there with him Y'know And that 's where psychic stuff comes in Like it just is n't right with him Y'know
That made me cry But anyway we went up to Boston because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River It gets frozen this time of year
Well for the last week anyway He 's kind of a kid Kind of a goofball but he 's really stuck on me which is flattering Who would n't like that And he 's like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart He 's the one who gave me that crow photograph
No not at all
No
Yeah
Yeah I think so It 's hard to
Yeah
Thanks
I do have a tendency to use that word too much
I think about that
Sorry My life is n't that interesting I go to work I go home I do n't know what to say
But I think I am I like to think I am
Exactly Exactly That 's exactly my feeling about it It 's hard to know Like okay but how many times do I think something and it does n't happen That 's what you 're saying right You forget about those times Right
Me neither But sometimes I have premonitions so I do n't know Maybe that 's just coincidence Right Y'know you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it Y'know
Well I go to a psychic and she 's always telling me I 'm psychic She should know Do you believe in that stuff
Y'know I 'm sort of psychic
Thanks
No I
Well I should probably get going
You just say I 'm not really
What do you want to hear
Ready for another
I 'm fine
Cheers
It 's pretty
Frost
I do n't know
Thanks That was good that crow sound
Very much

Someone 's got that job Agent Orange I came up with that one Anyway there are endless color possibilities and I 'd be great at it
Purple Haze Pink Eraser
Anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names Red Menace Yellow Fever Green Revolution That 'd be a job coming up with those names How do you get a job like that That 's what I 'll do Fuck the dole
Exactly Tom Waits Which song
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering
Ah the hair Blue right It 's called Blue Ruin The color Snappy name huh
I 'll go on the dole Like my daddy before me
Well I 'm there I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible You have a cell phone I need to quit right this minute I 'll call in dead
Jesus is it five years I got ta quit right now
Ucch really You 're kidding God Bizarre small world huh Yeah that 's me book slave there for like five years now
Get out Me too What are the odds
Just you know to chat a little maybe I have a long trip ahead of me How far are you going On the train I mean of course
No I do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to
Oh So
It 's okay if I sit closer So I do n't have to scream Not that I do n't need to scream sometimes believe me But I do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to write or something
Aw c'mon live dangerously Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car
Really
Why are you sorry I just said hi
Why
Jesus
I do n't know Panties and
You must have been crazy
I 'm just y'know passing the time best I can till I can see you
Hi it 's Joel
Look I have to go I have to think
It 's true
'S VOICE Maybe it 's true then It 's my voice on the tape
'S VOICE I probably got the same thing as you
'S VOICE Yeah
I guess so
Oddly enough I do
I just walked in
There you are Naomi it 's just I 'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had
'S VOICE Long day thinking
'S VOICE Yeah I tried you at home Did you get my message
'S VOICE Good I called you at work today They said you were home sick
'S VOICE Hi
I did n't want to go I was too nervous I thought maybe you were a nut But you were exciting You called from upstairs
I could n't believe you did that I was paralyzed with fear
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf
But I went back to my food The next thing I remember I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye
Your back to me In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually At the time I thought how cool an orange sweatshirt
Okay I wish you could come
Naomi
I ca n't I have to go home I 'll do it later
She 's so sexy
How 's the chicken
Right She called me an old lady here too And I remember I said
I was n't going to call her Not after the way she was
Oh God I miss her I ca n't believe she 's with that guy now I 'm never going to see her again I love her so much What a fucking monster she is
That 's your look for me
Maybe if I just explain what happened I would n't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and
Clementine I should just maybe talk to her
It 's too late
The pill was pink I remember It had some letters and numbers on it What were they AL 1718 AL something Four digits I do n't like taking pills when I do n't know what they are I have no choice
Fuck you Clementine
I might be making a mistake
The driver waved So casual friendly
It was snowing
I 'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased Stop it now
You have to stop this
It was a mess I do n't know how it got this way
Well I did
Well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking Nothing you 'll miss
We 'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards There is an emotional core to each of our memories As we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process By the time you wake up in the morning all memories we 've targeted will have withered and disappeared Like a dream upon waking
We 'll speak soon
I had a good time last night I really did
I do n't know I 'm not sure there 's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny
I 'm glad you called
A religion instructor at Columbia A good guy He 's a good guy
Miss you too I have been seeing someone for a little while
Oh sweetie It really does cut both ways We were taking each other for granted and
I 'm sorry
So you have n't been involved with anyone in all this time
I hope you get your work done
I 've got to finish this chapter anyway
In a minute
Go back to sleep
You did n't miss much Rob and Carrie say hello
Hi
It 's not somebody else
No I just need some space maybe
I think maybe we 're both so used to operating at this level that How can one person be unhappy If one person is unhappy both have to be by definition
Y'know we 've been I do n't know sort of unhappy with each other and
I do n't know I 've just been thinking maybe we 're not happy with each other
Do n't do this to me now Joel Really
You take it I do n't know
I think he 'll be in Bartlett 's one day
I like to read what smart people say So many beautiful important things
The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts
I love quotes So did Winston Churchill He actually has a quotation in Bartlett 's about Bartlett 's Is n't that trippy
Oh Patrick you did n't want any did you
Oh hey Patrick
Remember the Alamo Remember the Alamo
I wo n't allow it Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it What do you think of that That 's from my quote book
They have a right to know Howard is a thief He steals the truth I ca n't remember my baby I ca n't remember my baby It existed and I ca n't even remember Do you understand that
Then why did you ask me
Nothing
Can I I brought some
Hi
Thanks Stan
Do you remember anything else What I was wearing Was I standing close to him Was I leaning against his car like I owned it How did he look at me when I giggled Tell me everything
I never saw you together like that again So I figured I was imagining things
Happy Happy with a secret
It was here At his car I was coming back from a job and spotted you together You seemed caught I waved You giggled
And you never even suspected Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together
Do you swear you did n't know
Hell no
He 's coming
No way I can handle this
Sor-ry We have to do something He ca n't wake up half done
Well what should we do
I do n't know He 's not on the map
It 's not erasing He 's off the screen
What
You love him do n't you
Yeah
Go
Yup
Yup
Yeah I ca n't wait to tell Howard It seems really appropriate
Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil Found it my Bartletts
We have n't checked
You found us okay
I better do this Stan
'kay
Anyway I 've got to do my tap dance here
It 's just y'know I mean
Stan c'mon
Boo
You made me have you erased I loved you I love you How could you
You made me have an abortion
Do you love me Did you love me Something I listened to my tape I ca n't believe I 've been sitting right in front of it for a year It 's like listening to someone else 's story I mean I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I ca n't even imagine you naked I ca n't even say naked to you
Thanks So do we talk about this or what
What Howard
We ca n't do this
I 've got a wife Mary Kids You know that
Okay Good Great Thanks I like you Howard an awful lot Is that terrible
Really I thought it was appropriate maybe That 's all I really admire the work that you do I know it 's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we 're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to
You are such a sweetheart
Yes shit Oops sorry Sorry It 's just I told myself I was n't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it Like I psyched myself out
There 's another one I like I read It 's by Pope Alexander
Yeah yeah it is Howard And here I was thinking I could tell you something you did n't know
Okay um there 's one that goes Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders
Oh um like famous quotes I find reading them inspirational to me And in my reading I 've come across some I thought you might like too
Do you like quotes Howard
That was beautiful to watch Howard Like a surgeon or a concert pianist
Welcome Howard
Cole slaw ice tea
Yes
Thanks Mary You can bring her in
'S VOICE 1062 Sherman Drive Apartment 1E Rockville Center
'S VOICE He went home sick
'S VOICE I was away from the monitor for a second I had it on automatic I had to go pee
'S VOICE The guy we 're doing He 's disappeared from the map I ca n't find him anywhere
Jesus
I do n't know what you 're talking about Howard
Thanks Stan Thanks
That 's fine Stan
Oh dear
Yeah probably a good idea
Yeah Of course
I tried that already
Mary What are you doing here
Ah your journal This will be invaluable
WOMAN This book It 's essential that people read it because It 's the truth And only I know it
WOMAN Would you just try him You never know As long as I 'm here You never know
WOMAN Hi I was in the neighborhood and thought I 'd see
Thanks Stan I owe you
She 's right in the neighborhood She 's upset
Hold on Let me ask my friend Stan can I leave for a little while My girlfriend is very
What 's your bartlett 's
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties
Jesus Patrick
She was unconscious Patrick
Patrick we need to focus
This one 's history Moving on
You can if you want
She likes you okay
Just wanted to let you know
Yeah
Not a dump then but kind of plain Uninspired And there 's a stale smell Sort of stuffy I do n't know Stuffy
Yeah that looks better Thanks
Then check the connections
That 's your problem
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics All in Siwash Cave In a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools It would have to rely on its wits and its senses It would have to live with animals and plants as virtual equals It 's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve
Well if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard
But that 's an old story now I ca n't believe that you would leave the Butte
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City
The Countess has come to our aid The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls And I have been asked to oversee the ranch For 300 a week And as it turns out the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was here 's a picture
Is everything getting worse
What do you believe in then
Then if you are Japanese then why are you called the Chink
The Clock People
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People
Clockworks
Neither do I ha ha ho ho hee hee
Save your breath for the climb
I know who you are
Oh Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home
You might say that although I do n't think of it as traveling
Well no I do n't reside anywhere in particular I just keep moving
I do n't
I 'm staying with the Countess
If I flinch when you say you love me it 's both our problems My confusion becomes your confusion Students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains It 's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years
No I guess not
Hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but I 'm not in this for whooping cranes I 'm in it for cowgirls If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise I want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess
That 's Jellybean
You do n't agree with Debbie then
What is Debbie 's position
Learned from the Chink Oh my Ha ha That 's hard to say We mostly Uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth It 's not original It 's something I picked up from the Chink
You 're political then
About being a cowgirl What 's it all about When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
Tell me about it
No I 'm afraid that part is n't true Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover Besides I always travel alone
Er you seem to know who I am and maybe even what I am Thanks for the breakfast
COUNTESS Aw he 's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies too But though he be old and dirty he 's alive I 'll bet clear down to his toes They do n't have his juice in a jar in New Haven Well I suppose that I 'll have to write Sissy out on the road
COUNTESS Chink 's the guy 's name for Christ 's sake
COUNTESS What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools anyway Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck Why send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he 'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy Jesus H.M.S Christ If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they 'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps Oogie boogie
COUNTESS Whose fault was that
COUNTESS Shit O dear Julian Do you mean to tell me you did n't get it on
COUNTESS What do you think
How does she like what in bed
I think she 's disappointed that I 'm not more ah sort of atavistic She 's got some naive sentimental notions about Indians I 'm sure she liked me though but then she left town
Countess I 'm really in a dither She 's turned my head
Oh you I 'm not talking about her hands They 're difficult to ignore I confess but I 'm speaking of her whole being Her whole being is extraordinary The way she talks for example She 's so articulate
Extraordinary
Why Why do you have to go
But I do n't want you to leave Please stay We can go to dinner I owe you a dinner And tonight we can really make love
What are you doing
Here I 'll turn down the air conditioner
As I developed however I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style Time in terms of M.P.H no longer interested me I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast When I am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then I embody the rhythms of the universe I am in a state of grace
When I was younger I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
I 'm the best
Yep
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off
I was a successful model once
American Cheese The king of road food
You bet your raggedy white ass I am
COUNTESS Sissy You 're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches Well let your conscience be your guide as my mommy used to say but it wo n't work Those stinking sluts are going to suffer
COUNTESS Sissy do n't play dumb with me You 're a good model but a shitty actress The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance You know perfectly well they are Last seen in Nebraska Did n't make it to Canada Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake And who else but Jellybean 's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds How much do you know about it Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
Well okay I 'll try it I do n't see the point in it but I 'll try it Just for you It 's kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in New York City However
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship
Why yes technically Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close but he was afraid of me I think
COUNTESS Now now Do n't get exasperated I realize that you 've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and I might add you 've been wise Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage For men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics The male gets his food bed laundry TV pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he does n't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about But for a woman marriage is surrender
COUNTESS Purely personal I believe you might enjoy one another
COUNTESS Shit O dear that 's enough to make me asthmatic The nerve of those twits What do they know about female odor Do n't interrupt Here 's my concept My ranch out West It 's a beauty ranch Oh it 's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes But it 's a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows mainly can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment My ranch is named the Rubber Rose after the Rubber Rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world So get this It 's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence Well these cranes stop off at my little pond Siwash Lake it 's called twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do I 've never seen them understand but I hear they 're magnificent Very big specimens I mean huge mothers and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads Now whooping cranes in case you did n't know it are noted for their mating dance It 's just the wildest show in nature It 's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons Picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground Dears it 's overwhelming And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV Right there on the home screen creation 's most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground In a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum And a can of Dew Off-camera a string quartet is playing Debussy A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love Are you starting to get it Does n't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud My very goodness gracious Grandiose lyrical erotic and Girl Scout oriented you ca n't top it I 've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios the best wildlife cinematographers around You 're my eternal favorite Princess Grace herself could n't be better not even if she had your personality which she does n't Anyway dear I 'm out of photography now and into water colors Ah how circuitous conversation is We 're back at the beginning The exact man I 've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist
COUNTESS I am once more about to make advertising history And only you the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl could possibly assist me
COUNTESS Sissy Sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways The Countess has arranged a job for you And what a job
Your ranch
COUNTESS What Oh yes Tee-hee Jellybean
COUNTESS You were the Yoni Yum girl from let 's see from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy You 've always smelled so nice Like a little sister The irony has just killed me You the Dew Girl one of the few girls who does n't need Dew I loath the stink of females They are so sweet the way God made them then they start fooling around with men and soon they 're stinking Like rotten mushrooms like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool like a tuna fish 's retirement party They all stink From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean they stink
COUNTESS Shit O goodness you wo n't be thirty for another year and you 're more beautiful than ever
COUNTESS Freak schmeek Most of us are freaks in one way or another Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you 'll see what I mean
COUNTESS That 's the very first time in the eons that I 've known you that I 've ever heard you complain And now you 're tired poor darling
COUNTESS To my own special Sissy Cheers And welcome So my letter brought ya flying eh Where were you Salt Lake City La Conner Well I may have a little surprise for you But first tell me about yourself It 's been six months has n't it In some circles that 's half a year How are you
Justin
I 'm in the Second Containment area It 's pitch black in here There must have been a coolant leak Man this shit is everywhere I ca n't see a damn thing
Uh yeah Coop I 'm still here
I 'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it Now step aside old man
So if the ship did n't blow up what happened
I heard it
I am your best friend I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
It worked for Weir Prep the tanks
You prep the gravity couches I 'm going to manually arm those explosives
On my way
I 'll get him
Hold on Coop
Coop where are you
I 'll be all over it
come on Skipper I already put my shoes on
From what
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission
You can call him Baby-bear he loves that
Do n't start with me Cooper
Roger that
Solid as a rock Hey Smith
It 's holding She 's holding
We 'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel do n't you It fell down
You heard me This ship it 's crazy trying to go faster n light that 's like the Tower of Babel
I 'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can This ship is bad It watches you
I know what I saw and it was n't a fucking optical effect
I 'm telling you I saw it
Saw what Mr Cooper What did you really see because what you 're describing is not physically possible
No he did n't
Skipper do we get hazard pay for this
No thank you
What
Run
Hurry
I do n't want to go where the last crew went I 'd rather be dead
Can you shut it down
How The Bridge is gone
Let me breathe let me breathe
What 's happening
Is that an offer
Please kill
Please
What happened
No I do n't believe in that sort of thing But if Dr Weir is right this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe of reality Who knows where this ship has been What it 's seen And what it 's brought back with it
It sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi Hell
Do you hear it Right there
It 's not a distress call It 's a warning
Go on
What is it
I I tried to go back for him to save him but I could n't get to him in time The fire Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity It 's like a liquid it slides over everything It was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire And then he was gone I never told anyone until now But this ship knew DJ It knows about the Goliath it knows about Corrick It knows our secrets It knows what we 're afraid of And now you 're going to tell me it 's carbon dioxide
Of course not Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it Just one of those things I swore I 'd never lose another man I came close today Real close
He 'll live if we ever make it back
To conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity Anyone who can should get some sleep
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
How is he
We have n't tested the air yet It could be contaminated
Trauma
One thing at a time let 's keep him breathing Start the drip 15cc 's fibrinogen Christ he 's bleeding out
Intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
90 over 50 and falling
I 've got a pulse he 's alive
What 's wrong
What 's happening
What 's wrong
Thank you
A written briefing ca n't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this I have to go with them
It 's the Event Horizon She 's come back
Incredible These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened This is n't some kind of hoax
You wanted to see me Admiral
I want our best people on this Where 's Miller
It 's been two years since she died He 's over it
What 's on your mind
That does n't mean a damn thing They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill But he 's not responsible for what happened to the ship
You do n't just dismiss Bill Weir The man held Oppenheimer 's chair at Princeton If the Event Horizon had worked he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel This was the only response
Starck
From the Other Place
It 's inside and it eats and eats until there 's nothing left
What does
What Justin what shows you
That 's the Second Containment Seal Beyond that engineering
Background radiation Perfectly safe
You 've reached the First Containment Seal The engineering decks are on the other side
How do you know all this
Justin I wo n't let you die
You 're not going to die Not today I want you to do exactly as I say and I 'm gon na get you out of there alright
Skipper you got ta help me
Patch me through to him
Justin finish your sweep
Okay We do it the hard way Deck by deck room by room Starck deploy the umbilicus I believe you 're up for a walk Mr Justin Go get your bonnet on
Everything green on my boards Skipper
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months They 're been gone seven years
Since the initial transmission there 's been no further contact Just the beacon every two minutes
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation Dr Weir but it does n't factor into this
Dr Weir you have no experience with salvage procedures
This is Weir
I 'll get back to the log But on the bridge I wo n't go back back in there
Justin
Do it
Fine Starck I want you to repeat the bio-scan
Peters I want you to go through the ship 's log see if we ca n't find some answers
you okay
Skipper
Crystallized
Justin check the containment for radiation leaks Peters
Alive
The science workstation has power I 'll see if I can find the crew from here
What you got Peters
There 's no one here Skipper
Starck you still showing those readings
I do n't know this place is really dark I ca n't see a thing
So where are they Starck any luck with the bio-scan
Ice crystals everywhere This place is a deep freeze
Clear and open on my mark Three two one mark
I am sorry But now we have to go to work
I put in for a replacement for you but no one
What 's the hold up
You ca n't have them Go to hell
I 'm not asking you to believe me You 'll see for yourself and so will your crew You 're all coming with me
There is no Devil There is no God There is only NOTHING
Then what what are you Tell me
You want me to believe you 're the Devil well I do n't that 's bullshit
What are you
Then who the fuck are you
What makes you think I 'll miss
Do you know what a singularity is Miller Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is It is NOTHING Absolute and eternal NOTHING And if God is Everything then I have seen the Devil It 's a liberating experience
I do n't need them anymore Where we 're going we wo n't need eyes to see
Son of a bitch
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark doctor or you 'll find yourself looking for a ride home
Watch me
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed Fuck this ship
It 's done
Maybe you 're right But it 's still my command and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew And I think there is Starck download all the files from the Event Horizon 's computers Coop Smith finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship The crew is dead Dr Weir This ship killed them And now it 's killing us
We 're leaving
I DO N'T KNOW I do n't know There 's a lot of things going on here that I do n't understand Truth takes time
I do n't know
I do n't know
Yes
What do you want me to say
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations
Justin just tried to kill himself The man is clearly insane
Do it
We 're a long way from home and we 're in a bad place Let 's not make it worse If anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time
We do n't get the power back our air 's gon na go bad
We barely have enough power for life support as it is if we ca n't stop the drain we 're not gon na make it
What the hell is that Dr Weir
Explanation
It 's 2041
What about it
You have something Dr Weir
There 's no danger The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields it 's under control
If it worked yes
Insane The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star The Event Horizon could be there in a day
How much time do you need We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes Now what is in the Core
What could cause them What 's in the Core
Hold on what 's this gravitational distortion
Yes
It beats dying Mister Smith
No one
Any survivors
Easy Peters we 're okay we 're okay Let 's finish the sweep
I can see that what 're they for
You 're in the central corridor It connects the personnel areas to Engineering
That is not acceptable
Captain I did n't come out here to sit on your bridge I need to be on that ship
Be careful It 's not a load bearing structure
That 's the engineering containment And there 's the main airlock We can dock there
What does it say
Where has it been for the last seven years
Until then do what you 're told and stay out of my way
Doctor Weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to We were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no one 's even told us why
The clock is running Dr Weir If you 'll follow the rest of the crew they 'll show you to the gravity tanks
Smith Smith Fuck
Get out of there now
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock
Come again Skipper
I just saw Weir I think he was messing around on the Clark
Skipper
She was right behind me I turn around she 's gone She could be anywhere
Captain we got a problem
Get outside go back to work I 'll join you shortly
That 's enough
Understood
I 've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize it 's gon na take some time
Captain Miller you copy
But
No one 's dying on my watch Smith What about the reserve tanks
We do n't have time to fart
We have a situation here
Captain Miller
It is now We 're locked in
Put it through TACS Smith you up for a flyby
Proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 we 're right on top of it we 're gon na hit
1500 meters We 're getting too close
We 've got some weather
Yes sir
Something like that yeah
That 's not it That ship was built to go faster than light That 's just wrong it goes against everything we know
Bring us in tight Starck get on the horn see if anyone 's listening
One-four degrees
Heading three-three-four
Jesus
I do n't like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go Is the course locked in
Weir
repeat we 're armed
No I 'll be right back
We blow the Corridor Use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship We stay put
BLOW THE FUCKER UP
Weir activated the drive He 's sending us to the Other Place
Weir ca n't be alive
Tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
I 'm on my way Starck
He 's awake he 's in the airlock he 's not wearing a suit
Justin 's in the airlock
Miller come in
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes
I thought you wanted an answer And that 's the only one I have
I know that
It 's not bullshit it 's the only conclusion the data supports
I did n't say that I said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
You 've got to listen
Go ahead
bio-readings of indeterminate origin do n't you have anything useful to tell me
What is it Starck
Dr Weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
No It was someone else
Do it Dr Weir
Not acceptable I want to know what 's causing those readings If the crew is dead I want the bodies I want the crew found
So where is the rest of the crew We 've been over every inch of this ship and all we 've found is blood Dr Weir Any suggestions
What 's causing the readings
What about the life readings you picked up
We can take the filters from the Clark
Carbon dioxide
How much oh-two do we have
But you can breathe it
Okay Let 's find out how much time we just bought
Everybody okay
That 's an affirmative
Radiation interference
Come around to three-three-four
Then what are you doing here Come on people let 's go And Cooper Put some pants on
Starck why are n't you on the bridge
Ion drive will engage in T-minus ten minutes
We 're past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever you 're ready
Is n't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
I did
There 's no one here
Blood Looks like arterial spray
You 're at the Bridge Ms Peters You still have n't seen any crew
They 're explosive charges
DJ It 's okay You 're okay Just breathe
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan The shuttle 's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen There was a spark and both ships were incinerated The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat Captain Miller was able
He served on the Goliath
Do n't worry about it He 's hard but he 's fair You 're lucky to be shipping out with him He 's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach
First time in a grav couch
It 's cold
Skipper Justin just activated the door It 's on a thirty second delay
Come on Baby-bear open this door
Do you know what it was
Yes Yes Justin we heard it
He 's engaged the override
There 's no one in the corridor but us
Thank you for that scientific analysis Mister Smith
It still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
We 're losing atmosphere
That 's the Core the gravity drive The heart of the ship
Shit Doc any closer and we 're gon na need a rubber
She 's not ugly
Dead ahead 5000 meters
Say this paper represents space-time and you want to get from point A here to point B here Now what 's the shortest distance between two points
I do n't think this is a good idea we do n't even know what happened on that ship
I 'm trying goddammit
Miller do you read me Peters
Explosive decompression
Picking up magnetic interference
1000 meters
Range 3000 meters and closing
Matching speed now Range to target ten thousand meters and closing Skipper I got a bad feeling about this
The law of relativity prohibits faster than-light travel
All boards are green everything 's five by five
Smith 's right Neptune There 's nothing out there If something happens we 'll be on our own
It means nothing
Miller Smith Cooper any of you in the airlock
What is it
In our current environment Dr Weir self-control is an asset
What are you doing
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system
Yes I miss her She died Two years now
Yes
Hmmm Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her I told her that was n't true I just knew the Event Horizon better that 's all
I ca n't believe we built this
I do n't know The life readings just went off the scale
Ship 's log
If they were in stasis I 'd get a location but these readings they 're all over the ship It does n't make any sense
Affirmative The hull 's intact but there 's no gravity and the thermal units are off line I 'm showing deep cold The crew could n't survive unless they were in stasis
The reactor 's still hot We 've got several small radiation sources leaks probably Nothing serious
A straight line
How
I like the sound of that
My step-dad 's I 'm strictly into stone I was wondering when you 'd walk by
No I mean I 'm a little dusty
I 'm not really dressed for a party
How 'd you know it was me
Such a sad face You know sometimes being different is n't a bad thing
I do n't think She 's real big on hate
THING I mean
THING You do n't know what it 's like out there Walking around like some kind of circus freak People staring whispering
Sensual blind chick seeks three ton rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship
Victor must 've taken him
No it 's not I thought I was done waiting for Reed We 're all in this together now Ben
Just give Reed a little more time You know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one
He did n't mean it You know Johnny He 's always been a hothead
Oh he did
I would n't be caught dead in that
You look like an eighties rock band
We need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped
I can only stay for one drink Ben I 've got to meet with Victor
We can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here
I can handle the ship I can even handle Mr Blonde Ambition But I do n't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits Who the hell came up with them
Way to not overthink it So when do we leave
He could n't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass Yet another mistake for Mr Fantastic
Reed said it 'd be weeks till
What do you want Vic
What is this Where 's Reed
Come on Let me buy you something to eat Looks like you could use the company
I 'm worried about you
I already got it Everything I want
Deb it 's me It 's still me
Baby you 're scaring me
Ben
Deb It 's me I need you to step out front
Soon as I 'm back I 'm gon na trade that in for a bigger rock
I 'll be watching over you
Ben I 've been crunching the numbers on the machine I think if we can rework the power settings
Time for your lesson Vic Chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal Ben
Glad nothing could take you away from your work
We 're working as hard as we can
Ben
It 's about to be a broken face
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
Yeah You do n't wan na know the details
If we 're going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes
Yeah nine years straight
Am I okay You wan na explain that
What the
Are you alright
He 's smart powerful successful
What Come on She 's got a good thing with Victor
Yeah you and Debbie and perfect
I should have done more run more tests
I do n't know I just keep going over and over the numbers
Three days I was worried about you How are you feeling
Ben This is serious Turn around
Should
Victor 's better at these things
He 's made a few changes
This makes five
Five times
I 'm sure he 's matured since then
Youthful high spirits
External SRBs orbital system engines Its just like the shuttles you flew in
I know I know I 'm just worried about what he wants Speaking of which
Maybe you should think about yourself for once You always let this guy push you round
He knew about NASA What if he made the call to shut us down
What about his first born
I ca n't take this
He 's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century
Good thing it ai n't workin Reed what are we doing here This guy 's fast-food strip-mall science
No more cracks about how I look
The machine works And Vic 's gone Mister Hyde on us
Hey That 's a prototype
They said that 's not such a good idea the shock alone could
I swear to you they 've done everything humanly possible The best plastic surgeons in the world Ben You had the best
They 're fine Everybody else is fine
Back on Earth Victor 's medical facility We 're in quarantine
Do n't you wander off boy
Let 's see you got Victor stud of the year more coin than God Or Reed the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp Hmmm it 's a toss-up
Yeah well his eyes say different
Please tell me your dawg 's not trying to rekindle things with my sister
If you behave maybe next time daddy 'll let you drive
What the hell you smiling at Just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those SMBs
But this disease is progressive degenerative
What
What do you mean complete
Like the shields Reed said would protect us How long
And they 're changing into
NURSE No You 're ON FIRE
NURSE You 're on fire
I though we went over this
Me like-y
NURSE My shift ends at four but I could n't
NURSE I mean you feel a little feverish
NURSE You 're hot
NURSE And where do we think we 're going
But all these people
A higher calling like getting girls and making money
You need to control yourself and think before you
That 's what I 'm trying to calculate And it 's not rubber It 's muscle tendon I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to
He 's right These costumes are missing something I ca n't put my finger on it
What No I 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
Is there something about flames About flaming that you
Not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to Earth 's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it
Back it down Johnny
This place is deluxe You got cable
Oh it is
What he 's trying to say is every team needs a mascot
You 've been working out
Ben are you there
Cool What 'd it do to you guys
Now what is up with that
He 's not responsive
Victor 's right Johnny get to the command center Close the shields
Sis Let me take care of you for once
No I 'm sorry for pushing you out
As soon as you stop acting like one Come on you 're smarter than this You think those people out there care about you You 're just a fad to them
Johnny slow down Think You know mom did n't raise us to
Is that what you call it Real
Johnny Did you see Ben
You two need a time-out
You 're gon na pay for that Pebbles What
I 'm driving
Uh we call my sister the invisible girl the Invisible Girl
Sweet
You 're really cramping my style here
Grow up Johnny You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
I think that thing is Ben
Okay mom
Johnny
Please tell me you go silent too
Keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
Top left like you asked Today Wall Street Tomorrow who knows maybe Washington
Yes sir You 've got the Mayor at eight then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal
That 's why Because I could have any other woman You know when they asked Caesar why England he said because it 's not mine
Later First I 've got some unfinished business A deal that needs closing
And that 's a good thing
Get me on the AM shows Larry King cover of the Journal I 've got to do something about this scar Make sure they only shoot my right side
Reed 's disaster You know I half think he did this to me on purpose
How 's the IPO
Leonard how 's the feed
Then what is it
Our numbers are through the roof The IPO 's tracking at fifty sixty a share The bank 's five times oversubscribed
They 're ready for you sir
And if he 's not
A gasket Reed we 're at a party
I 'm sure I can come up with something
You need a doctor
Reed stop you need to rest your
That would have kinda defeated the purpose And Reed I 'm saying it now
When I walked out I waited ten minutes outside your door Ten Waiting for you to come find me
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you speak his mind One who was n't afraid to tell you what he wanted
You know I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
You were
Reed Shh Just be quiet And look up
I 'm not the only one in there I got you Vic Ben Johnny all rattling around in there
Which is why I 'm working twenty hours a day checking every variable
He was going to take away all my data equipment
No way to know Without more tests experiments
With the right energy we can stabilize the storm Maybe tie into the city grid
Of course Of course
Curing countless diseases not just ours
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm we can reverse the polarity
What are you doing
There were a lot of variables to consider
I think it was a little more complicated than
No I distinctly remember you walked out my door Ergo
I mean you broke up with me right
I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I did n't mean to do that You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or
Okay Is there any way to duplicate that feeling Some memory or
I 'm saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger Can you remember the exact emotions when
You should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better
It 's not invisibility per se You 're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field That 's what you projected on the Bridge
That 's what we 're here to find out
What Oh
We need to get past them
Let 's not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
Sue look at your hands
Uh Sue I ca n't
For science
Which was
You 're happy for me and Victor
That 's good That 's uh good
Feeling better
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules I 've been working on a formula for this
As far as crew I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission
I uh think I remember the number
Well uh based on our history you can handle the biogenetics and I 'll focus on the molecular physics Or uhm maybe I should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho
Those solar winds are flaring but I factored them into my coordinates and
You 're you 've I mean how have you bee
But I 'm not done with the machine
What are you doing here
Victor if we could understand what happened to us
I ruined With all due respect I told you to abort
Not much We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
He 's had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud And he 's not the only one
Ben did this
It 's too late for him and soon it 'll be too late for all of us
Reed we 're running out of time
So reel him in But we came here to do a job So let 's do it Quickly
Get a grip Reed We did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch Just close the shields
Sure
Hilarious
The number 's seventy-five And it 's applications and patents
Not at all
You remember in school we talked about working together That 's what I was about to explain
Victor we ca n't do anything until the research is ready
Please do n't make this personal
If these molecules are n't stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us
He 's working round the clock But the data needs to be tested analyzed before
Victor wait slow down a second I want you to know I appreciate everything you 've done for me but I just do n't
You said it was urgent
I 'm sorry I did n't get a chance to
Victor your scar
Victor I 'm sorry I
What 's going on
Raising the shields
Sue I 've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps And this is the biggest step yet If it helps think of this as a promotion A merger of sorts Four little words that can change our lives
Right of course the company But you see I 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with
Well when you 're looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past
Surprised I agreed to Reed 's proposal
It 's just business
For your sake I hope you 're right I 'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
I 'm just saying I know what it 's like to lose something you love To see it slip away and know it 's never coming back
I know it ca n't be easy Life has n't changed that much for Reed Sue and Johnny At least they can go out in public But for you People staring Whispering behind your back
All right
Oh man if you could swing something there I 'd do anything for you I want to work with you guys
Brad I really fuckin hate McDonald 's man Ever since they started in with the chicken everything went downhill
Brad can I talk to you a minute
I 'm just glad we 're still together Lisa because I need you this year
If you 'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back
I do n't want to talk about it here Brad
Brad I do n't want to have to use sex as a tool
Do n't worry about it
Of course
Later
There it is
On the ledge
I ca n't find it mon
Totally
Come on Spicoli Why do n't you just put your shirts back on See the sign
Yes I think so Show some pride Hamilton
Come on Hamilton You 're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips We have stores all over Southern California Part of our image part of our appeal is in our uniforms You know that
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform
Hamilton come over here What is that you 've got on
Mister if you do n't shut up I 'm gon na kick 100 of your ass
I 'm sorry sir Just let me find the forms here
I ca n't do that But if you wait a minute
Well that 's not the way it works really And you ate most of your food already too
Well I believe you have to fill out a form There 's a pad right around here
No
Brad Please do n't tell Mom and Dad
Thanks a lot Brad I really appreciate it
Yeah This is it I have some shopping to do
Does Mom know you have company
Maybe yes Maybe no
But your face did
You are a virgin
I do n't know I was just curious
Hey Brad Are you still a virgin
Maybe you just need to give her some time She 's so nice Brad Everybody loves Lisa
I 'm just guessing
Why Because she wo n't sleep with you
You 're going to break up with Lisa are n't you
Is everything okay at work
It 's just some guy I met at Swenson 's You do n't know him
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers
I 'd say who the hell is Ron Johnson
They 're not home yet
Do n't strain yourself
Your friends use the pool too
Why ca n't you do it
Hey-yo
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is How should I know where Lisa is What am I gon na do Now my little sister goes to the same high school The party 's over So who do you have first period
Hi Brad
Yes sir
He insulted me first He called me a moron
Okay Dennis
But they were n't mine
They were left over from the last shift
No just a couple of surfers with no shirts on I took care of it Dennis
Go away Curtis If you ca n't knock I ca n't hear you
Dad says
Dad says you 're late again you butthole
Ugh
Get going
Mike You have a mess on C-9
Half Okay Seventy-five dollars And a ride to the clinic
It 's already planned Mike It 's going to cost 150 at the Free Clinic
We 've got to get an abortion
All right I take it back
I know it 's yours
Mike I want you to know that I 'm pregnant
What Now
What 's going on
I 'm in a hurry too I just thought I could say hi to you
I did n't see you this morning
I guess I did
What 's wrong
I think we 're making a lot of noise
Hey Mike
I want you to know that it 's your final decision if we should continue or not
You first
No Are you crazy
You 're a really good kisser
Listen I feel pretty strange here Because Mark really likes you and he 's my friend
Are you really a virgin
Pick a suit
Well
I know what I look like

That 's the idea Rat That 's The Attitude
Do n't talk to her Let her know Use your face Use your body Use everything This is what I do I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that girls do respond Something happens
RAT You tell me Mike What do I do
RAT Really
RAT Well what do you want me to do Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say 'Hello I 'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me
RAT No It 's too soon
RAT No
RAT She 's in my biology class
RAT Damone you got ta listen to me
RAT What do you mean wuss This girl is my exact type It 's her Definitely her
You should work for yourself
And do n't let them talk you into a diaphragm either
Not if you 're over sixteen
All right what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly several times a week and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty 's
Yes
Merv I 'm thinking I 've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards
Totally
That 's me Merv
Fascinating
Well it pretty much speaks for itself Peter you want to run with it
I do n't go at all
School School is no problem All you have to do is go to get the grades And if you know something all you have to do is go about half the time
Seriously Merv everything is great I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend maybe going up to the mountains
I was going to say your eyes look a little red
How 've you been
That 's him He did it
Will you just relax mon He 's not gon na kill us My father is a television repairman He 's got all kinds of tools I can fix-this car
Make up your mind Is he gon na shit or is he gon na kill us
Just be glad you 're all right
You know the thing I love about Mustangs The steering wheel
All right Die Granada Jocks
They 're fuckin with us
This ai n't no cop
I like sex
Suzanne Somers tits
Seen the new Playboy
He is
Hey slow down This is my brother 's car
There 's a world of guys out there I just wish I did n't have to date any of them
I did n't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I 'd make it
Well I might go to Dartmouth
Yeah like maybe never
He says he 's got to stay in Chicago He says I should visit him sometimes
He 's not coming
Romance in Ridgemont We do n't even get cable TV
What do you want
Come on There 's lots of men around here Keep your eyes open
Stacy he 's not a guy He 's a little prick
There goes your stereo for another year Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick I 'm not letting him get away with this
That little prick
That little prick
You 're right I did n't tell you that
What
But it costs money to have an abortion Even at the Free Clinic You tell Damone to pay for it It 's the least he can do It 's the guy 's responsibility too
Of course it was Damone If it was Ron Johnson you 'd be out to here
It could n't be
What do you think it is
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks
God Stacy it 's not that sad It 's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban
Stacy I 've got water in my ears Do you have any Q-Tips
God he hardly even talks anymore
I did n't ask for any help Did you Linda
What do you think
What 's Doug do in Chicago
How long does Doug take
No But it 's a nice idea
Climax together
You 're right Probably penis mouth and neck
Okay penis that 's one balls
Why do n't you put your mother 's secret book back
I sent a letter to Doug today I 'll be so glad when he gets out here
Oh come on What is he Fifteen
Thanks a lot
I should quit this job I 'm going to get so fat working here nobody will ever take me out
Do n't you think it meant anything to him Even if I am fifteen
I guess Ron has n't called yet
You 've got to get used to working Christmas People are always screaming and yelling then they get home and they 're all Christmasy
If he ever calls again I 'll say I 'm eighteen
Does Doug care that you 're seventeen
There There 's his car I know he 's at work tonight He has n't come into Swenson 's since he called my house My mother told him I was still at high school after I told him I was nineteen I guess I should tell him I 'm fifteen
Come on Linda It 's just sex
It was nice
It was okay
Oh That 's where that group got its name from
There 's nothing to it
What 's the big deal
What variables
What do you mean 'better in bed You either do it or you do n't
Oh give me a break Stacy You 're much prettier than them
I know
God People exaggerate so much at this school
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr Hand this morning
I ca n't believe I start high school tomorrow
He was hot was n't he
Really
I ca n't do that
So what did you do
Come on Linda I have n't had a boyfriend all summer You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change Do you think he 'll call this week
He gave me his card 'Ron Johnson Audio Consultant
What should I do
Yeah but I fucked up You can take it Really
Do you think that guy 's cute
HAND Aloha Spicoli
All right Oh yeah
You 're gon na flunk me
No way mon When I graduate U.S history I ai n't even coming over to your side of the building
Do you have a guy like me every year A guy to I do n't know make a show of Teach other kids lessons and stuff
Hey Mr Hand can I ask you a question
HAND Well then I 'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you
HAND Now Mr Spicoli comes a rare moment for me Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account Tonight you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement all the associated treaties and the American Revolution in particular Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty
I do n't know I guess so
Did I do something wrong Mr Hand
Yeah The Graduation Dance Mr Hand It 's the last school event of the year
HAND That 's right Jeff Mind if I come in
HAND And you my friend I 'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week
I 've been thinking about this Mr Hand If I 'm here and you 're here does n't that make it our time
Learning about Cuba Having some food
I do n't know
I do n't know mon The food lines took forever
I could n't make it in time
Hey Wait a minute There 's no birthday party for me here

That 's a nice shirt
The point sounds fine
I do n't know Wherever you want
Thanks So do you
No problem
How about your phone number
I know everyone says that
I 'd like that
Yeah I want you to have this picture so you wo n't forget what I look like And so you 'll remember to call me over the summer
I know everybody says it but I really mean it
I 'm fine Mark I 'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year
Hi Mark
What about the notes
I made a fool of myself
RAT John Bonham The drummer for Led Zeppelin He died a couple years ago Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded It 's like his own holiday
RAT It 's John Bonham 's birthday
RAT Today 's April 16th Damone never comes to school on April 16th
RAT Well it 's getting kind of late
RAT I 've got to go home
This is me in the eighth grade Did you have Mr Deegan
Do you want to see some pictures I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high How stupid right
Thanks So What do you want to do
RAT Naw I do n't mind
RAT No That 's okay

Yes
Right
Sure That 's a good idea One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia
Some of what
I could already feel the stuff working on me the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine maybe I should take a swim I thought
Jesus what kind of monster client have you picked up this time There 's only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body
Where 'd you get this
I remember thinking Jesus what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid
Adrenochrome
What is this
It 's gone too far
She really flipped over you The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself I guess she figures you won That phone message was n't for me was it
No she 's looking for you
Good work They 'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that
Sometimes it 's easier to just rip out the backstraps
Sure It 's all on the Q.T but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line
What 's wrong with you Hell somebody has to do it
Yeh naked except for the weapons
Like big lizards
What could they do The guy that took the head was about six-seven and maybe three-hundred pounds He was packing two Lugers and the others had M-16s
Hell in Malibu alone these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day All they want is the blood They 'll take people right off the street if they have to

Maybe we should take it easy tonight
That 's good You ca n't be subtle in this town
I felt like a Nazi but it had to be done
Us
What What kind of goddamn monster are you
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards But it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect My attorney
NO I felt sorry for the girl I wanted to help her
You filthy bastard I should cave your fucking head in
NO Stop talking like that
Jesus Christ I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff
Listen she 's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months It 's terrible
Shit I met her on the plane and I had all that acid You know those little blue barrels I gave her a cap before I realized she 's a religious freak Jesus she 's never even had a drink
Plans
It ca n't be helped This is Lucy You know like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
You 're supposed to be in Vegas We have a suite at the Flamingo I was just about to leave for the airport
What are you doing in Baker Did n't you get my telegram
Who said anything about slicing you up I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead Nothing serious
The cops
You cheap honky sonofabitch
You bastard You 'd do that would n't you
Fuck yes I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it
Jesus
Not me It would blast you through the wall stone dead in ten seconds and they 'd make me explain it
Do n't touch it Get back in that tub
Whatever 's right
Of course I 'm your attorney I 'll give you all the time you need at my normal rates 45 an hour but you 'll be wanting a cushion so why do n't you just lay one of those 100 bills down there beside the radio and fuck off
I dig my own graves Green water and the White Rabbit Put it on
Jefferson Airplane White Rabbit I want a rising sound
Music Turn it up Put that tape on
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight I have to put the car in the lot
They did n't have any They do n't grow in the desert
Room service sent it up I wanted something to cut the limes
That 's right laugh about it You goddamn honkies are all the same
That dirty bastard I knew it He 's got hold of my woman
Do n't kid yourself That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous He 's watching us like a hawk
Let 's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose
Yeah I thought we might need it
Do n't run They 'd like any excuse to shoot us
Good God Let 's get out of here Where 's the elevator
Did you see that Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back
When does this thing stop
OK Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly It 's going to be a long walk
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door
OK I 'll lend you some money Let 's go outside and see how much we have left
Calm down You 'll be straight in a few hours
GO
Not much Why
Look over there Two women fucking a Polar Bear
Nonsense We came here to find the American Dream and now we 're right in the vortex you want to quit You must realize that we 've found the Main Nerve
Get sheep over side women and children to armored car orders from Captain Zeep
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think What 's happening here What 's going on Then you hear yourself mumbling
This is the place They 'll never fuck with us here
Did the mescaline just kick in Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig
What do you expect I 'm your attorney You owe me five bucks I want it now
Why what
To do the job of course Here we go a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars

I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda I told him I knew what he was up to He says he 's a photographer But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked He knows we 're onto him
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things It wo n't be long before they tear us to shreds
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side Who 's Lacerda he 's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor
Maybe thirty more minutes As your attorney I advise you to drive at top speed It 'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal Are you ready for that Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid
You whore
God did n't do that You did it You 're a fucking narcotics agent that was our cocaine you pig
And eat them That bastard wo n't get away with this What 's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism
The truth is we 're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry I 've known him for years but he ripped us off and you know what that means right
What the fuck are we doing out here Somebody call the police We need help
Turn up the fucking music My heart feels like an alligator Volume Clarity Bass We must have bass What 's wrong with us Are you goddamn old ladies
Where 's the medicine
He said he understood but I could see in his eyes that he did n't He was lying to me
Damn right
We will You Samoans are all the same You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man 's culture
Do n't take any guff from these swine Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment Nothing dinky One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike for picking up conversations in oncoming cars
Indeed We must do it What kind of story is this
Why not If a thing 's worth doing it 's worth doing right
It 's okay He 's admiring the shape of your skull

Miss Farmer you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen
Miss Farmer is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night
You 're on your way to a contempt citation young lady
Did you expect him to look you up
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed
Answer the question Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation
Is that not true
What
I live here
What happened Who 're you
You got it
The speech Real good
I already have
Your big speech
Good Then it 's very simple You have to stop being afraid Frances It 's in you
I need an incendiary An arsonist
Yes you win them you bring them into your heart touch them but you do n't set them on fire
I know but I 'm not seeing it It 's there Frances the fire is there but it 's not coming through You 're lazy
'Golden Boy
No You 're not talking now You listen You can send me away Lillian you can pretend I 'm crazy and pretend I 'm still your little girl who ca n't take care of herself but one thing you ca n't pretend anymore You ca n't pretend I love you because I do n't I ca n't Not after what you 've done to me Because you see I 'm still me I 'm trying real hard all this time to be me and you 'little sister you have n't been any help at all Okay boys I 'm ready
No All you 've done is try to break my spirit try to turn me into you But I 'm not you mother and I never will be and thank god for it That goes for you too And frankly I do n't know how with the two of you I turned out as sane as I am Wait right there gentlemen I 'll be with you in a minute and believe me I do n't want to stay here one second longer than I have to But I 've got to tell you Lillian that one day before you die you will realize what you 've done and hang your head in shame In shame
You were hoping for a kind word You 're my mother You 're supposed to nourish me Support me
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath
Little sister I do n't want you to feel any rush to get back to work I want you to rest for a while anyway
You know little sister I never resented you for refusing to see me in the the hospital I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back
Oh just leave those things for now
Of course she has n't anything definite in mind
Yes I am and you ca n't stop me You ca n't tell me what to do mother I 'm a grown woman and I can decide about my own life
I 'm going out
You You 'd send me back would n't you You would
Mama shut up
No
I 'm not cured I was never sick They had no business putting me in there My only responsibility is to myself now
Have n't you heard what I said
Mama
Wait Mama wait I have something to tell you I 've decided well I 'm not going to make movies anymore I thought that 's what I wanted and I went after it with all my soul the way you taught me but I was miserable Mama and it nearly killed me So now now it 's over I want a different kind of life something simple I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful in the country maybe and I 'll have dogs and cats I feel so light suddenly so clear for the first time in It 's going to be okay Mama I know it And I love you
I 'm back Mama
I do n't want you drinking Frances
You know the surest way to lose an appetite is to drink little sister
Say you promise
At one Promise
I 'll have lunch ready by one
How long will you be
Where are you going
What 's wrong
Please I want you to It would make me so happy
Frances you remember my lawyer Alma Styles
Go on
You kill me Mama
Then why did you bring them
Why are these all opened
Are you crazy Unhand that woman That 's Amelia Earhart
You 're taking me home
Mama what 's
Smile little sister smile
You will
Yes but important people are concerned about this Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles
Oh Mama do n't you understand
Oh Ma they 're not using me It 's just a chance to travel see things Besides it 's the only way I can get to New York
And you should be proud You won that contest and made a name for yourself
Do n't listen to him little sister When you 're proud of what you are you do n't refuse the label understand
Mama
HILLIER 'S WIFE No my dear You must be mistaken
HILLIER 'S WIFE I do n't believe so
HILLIER 'S WIFE Yes
HILLIER 'S WIFE On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club as a token of our vast admiration
Symington says
Frances I 'm warning you
'Cause if it 's long enough which I doubt why do n't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass
Dr Symington how big is your dick
Mental illness is an elusive thing and though I 'm pleased you 're feeling more capable it 's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time Do n't you agree
Frances you 're still filled with anxiety You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends Consequently I did n't recommend your release at the staff review
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative Whom do you think I should believe
Oh for Christ 's
I never said Oh look That 's just a figure of speech She said something funny and I said
What
No What I mean is I 'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life that 's all
Not at all She brought me my fan mail I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me But I guess that 's the best thing about working in the movies You make so many friends I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me was n't a mistake
Yes It was very good to see her
You did n't say 'Symington says
Oh that 's good very professional In control But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away
No you stay calm Doctor But you 're finding that difficult are n't you Why are you attracted to me Perhaps later in some of our more intimate sessions after we know each other a little better and you 've torn my personality to shreds and I 'm weeping and vulnerable then you 'll really get your kicks wo n't you Doctor
This whole thing is a joke
Did you really say that
Normal Average
Besides I do n't want to be what you want to make me
You may discuss my predicament Doctor You may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me I 'm not interested I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian
Do you expect me for one moment to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do
Oh Are you really
So it seems May we be serious for a moment
I 'm glad to see you have n't lost your sense of humor
Thanks are hardly necessary
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance
CROWD No No
CROWD No
CROWD No
NURSE 'Incurable
NURSE Yeah well you know doctors They sure hate to use that word
NURSE I checked the files This one holds the record for shock treatments Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight
NURSE I do n't know why they even bother She 's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant
What kindness
Would you not He was father And mother We fell from grace together He from his God I from mine
And he drove me to mine
I am as he made me In his own image
I longed to be with him But I wanted his final moments to have peace I could see you were a friend to him
Yes
I am afraid
I have been afraid Afraid they will hate me because I am so very ugly and they are so very beautiful
Yes Very close
Yes I have been seeking my friends
Worse
I 'm very very ugly People are afraid Except you
Better that way for me
The music Or the fire
SHE 'LL NEVER BE YOURS SHE SAID MY NAME SHE REMEMBERS
I 'm sure the lady knows her own mind Does n't she Let her decide the proper suitor
She 's beautiful
I will not Kill me now
No I draw the line
This was not taken from a grave
What is this
Why her
Yes I want this over and done with
We 'd travel north my bride and I To the furthest reaches of the Pole where no man has ever set foot There we would live out our lives Together No human eye would ever see us again This I vow
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being I would make peace with all I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine And rage the likes of which you would not believe If I can not satisfy the one I will demonically indulge the other That choice is yours You 're the one who set this in motion Frankenstein
A companion A female Like me so she wo n't hate me
There is something I want A friend
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all
Stolen memories Stolen and hazy They taunt me in my dreams I 've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her Whose woman was this I 've seen boys playing splashing about in a stream Whose childhood friends were these Who am I
In which part of me did this knowledge reside In these hands In this mind In this heart And reading and speaking Not things learned so much as things remembered
Materials Nothing more
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand
I 'm not sure I believe But then I had no one to instruct me I had no mother and my father abandoned me at birth
Evil Do you believe in evil
Your crime as well as mine
More to the point why am I here What did you want with me What does one say to one 's Maker having finally met him face to face Milton gave it voice Did I request thee Maker from my clay to mould me Man Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me
Kill you Hardly that
The letters in your journal That and a geography book Your Elizabeth sounds lovely
Yes I speak And read And think and know the ways of Man I 've been waiting for you Two months now
Come warm yourself if you like
Are you all right
And not a word of them to Father He 's agitated enough not hearing from Victor
I should go I should leave today
Something 's wrong I know it I 've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg
Nothing Still nothing
Must 've been a terrible row
You dance so beautifully together
Scandalous What would your dear mother say
Quite right
There there shhh
It 's far too late for him to still be out
Is he not back yet
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left He 's coming home to marry me
He set things right with a proper apology and now they 've put him in charge of dissection lab
Open this door for no-one
I have been waiting for this ever since
Now husband and wife
I do But you must trust me for now
Yes We 're in danger here Every moment we stay
We 'll leave this afternoon right after the ceremony Pack only what you need
It was misguided and pointless Is your answer yes
No Not tomorrow not next week Marry me today
We need each other now I need your comfort and strength not separation and solitude
What of our marriage Victor we 've had so much tragedy I want this family to live again
What sort of task
I thought I 'd never see you again
Do you know this man Is there something between you
If what you say is true it is a matter for the police
But why risk yourself Has n't this family suffered enough
Elizabeth My more than sister
until our wedding night When our bodies will join
Your decision For us
Not as weak as I
I will be here when you return
If only I could But one of us must stay Father 's not strong Willie 's just a child Who can look after them in your absence Who can run the estate
I wish to be your wife
Brother and sister still
This feels incestuous
I 've loved you all my life
You will What do you want Victor
Prouder still You 'll be the handsomest student there
Father 's so proud
Smell the air Wonderful
Do n't listen Willie Progress is a feast to be consumed Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run Or run before you can waltz
Oh do give him here He needs to be comforted and held
Victor have a care You 'll make him dizzy
God took her from us
What kind of God is He to will this
How could all my father 's knowledge and skill fail to save her
Are you sure it ca n't hurt us
Do n't cry Elizabeth
He died Raving about phantoms He was mad poor devil Gather a detail Have the body removed from my cabin
A warming wind
They knew the risks when they signed on I 've come too far to turn back now
It would n't dare
Oh God
Thank goodness We 'd be out of work
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes
You 're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated
Let it go
I owe you that Done
I 'll be back as soon as I 've got her far away and safe We 'll hunt this fiend down together
Are you sure you 'll be all right
What happened up there
For what
Quite a place
No They do n't
Nothing in moderation Frankenstein
We catch a few hours sleep where we can Usually here at your bedside
Mine and Professor Krempe 's We 've been trading off nursing you in shifts The rest of the time we 're out working with the cholera victims It 's his turn for that just now
We feared cholera Turned out to be pneumonia brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm
Thank God your fever broke Slowly now Just a sip I 've been worried we might lose you It 's been touch-and-go for a week
Listen to what I 'm saying The militia 's arriving to quarantine the city Most of us are getting out while we still can
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak Thousand new cases a day now Classes have been suspended University 's shut down
Few months perhaps I 'm gathering the raw materials even now
That is my concern I 'm involved in something just now I want to finish it in Waldman 's memory
I 've been preoccupied
There are sick people who need our help Here and now Not in some future time Consider that
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor
That 's blasphemy
You ca n't Death is God 's will
You 're making a scene
Keep your voice down You do n't know what you 're saying
They 'll hang him all the same
They just caught the man who did it
And here 's to Him Everything in moderation Frankenstein
Only you would think of that
yes and thanks to him smallpox has been virtually eliminated I 've heard this speech before
Now you 've got him started
What now Writing about it in your journal wo n't help
The entire school heard it It was n't something one could miss
Quite a few
Rich old ladies and their daughters
Do you really think I 'm mad
Victor Victor Frankenstein
Of course I am It pays to humor the insane
As a march hare
Very well then
I have no knowledge of that
Murder Willie In my heart he was our child Victor 's and mine Such a thing could never have entered my mind
I have always loved him
Yes I took refuge in the barn Would n't you Lost in the storm Freezing and wet I was exhausted and could search no longer
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum
Victor Frankenstein sir Of geneva
Or Albertus Magnus Cornelius Agrippa
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect Paracelsus for one
But surely Professor you do n't intend we disregard the more philosophical works
Oh now you have gone too far There 's only one God Victor
The strain was evident
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system
Our profession needs talent like yours Destroy your career over an issue of pride What a waste
a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty
I doubt that decision is still mine to make
But the possibilities Combining ancient knowledge with new Something like this could change our fundamental views
It 's utterly fantastic This is the sort of thing I 'm talking about We should be learning this
I once saw it done as a boy in Canton My parents were missionaries The cure was nothing short of miraculous I 've never forgotten it Been fascinated ever since
No I embrace it as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known
To say the least I came here to expand my mind but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper
Professor Waldman
Who are you
Madness
Lives are ephemeral The knowledge we gain the achievements we leave behind those live on
Then explain it whatever it is It could save the voyage I 've spent years planning this My entire fortune
You know of it
I ca n't say I blame them We 're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of creature
Would-be I 'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment
There 's a startling question coming from you I 'm captain of this ship We sailed from Archangel a month ago seeking a passage to the North Pole
Are you a physician
I 'm dying
Maybe we should wait for Mr Christy
VOORHEES I will protect you
Bill Bill Bill is out there
No no they 're all dead
Jack Marcie Ned
He 's dead She 's dead all dead Please save me oh poor Bill Oh my God oh my God oh God
Good night Alice
Give them a little while longer It 's still early anyway
I was careless
Right Right
Shows how much you know It 's something about tomorrow
What 'd you see
I 've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff but I 'll be back around ten If you 're still up we can talk okay
Next Friday
I do n't know Probably be best for everybody
Just a feeling Nothing personal
Oh thanks I wish I could spend more time at it
You told her to sweep the courts
Push on this side Alice this is Jack Marcie and Ned Push
It 's over twenty miles to the crossroads Steve 'll be back in an hour Things will straighten out then We 'll take his Jeep and get help
Wet I do n't know
No There must be some in the desk somewhere
It 's dead Try the pay phone
Marcie
Okay
They 're off now
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field
It sounded like Brenda
I do n't hear it anymore
Help you clean up
Good point
Not if they 're where I think they are
Bad bulb or no power It 's getting a little gloomy in here
Slipped in Probably liked the scent of your perfume
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes like you do n't care about children
Almost five
I do n't know
I walked into it knowing I 'd get hurt but I thought I could stand anything I just was n't ready for that kind of pain We were supposed to meet in L.A When I got back there he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife
Artist
You 're right It makes no sense
Maybe I can help
How come you 're leaving
Oh my God
Steve said you were thinking of leaving True
You think you 're gon na last all summer
Alice The others show up
Steve said for you to start on the boats
I 'm gon na go lie down and catch some z 's Today wiped me out Thanks Alice
Ned We 're gon na be working together for a while You 're a nice guy without all the entertainment okay
Do n't burn that gorgeous body or I 'll scratch your eyes out
Some campers drowned Then some counselors got killed
I need you so much Claudette
Come on Claudette A man 's not made of stone
No they wo n't
Claudette
I would n't know
You know what I said though
You said we were special
You just had some lucky shots
Chance to get even
Roll him over
What is it
Floor probably leaks This area is full of springs
Thanks
You saved my life
I 'll be okay Holy shit
This is almost like the one at my uncle 's cabin in Maine
Give me a hand
What the hell
That was the telephone
Whatever you make yourself
We would n't want you thinking you 're the only show-off in camp would we
Dancer
God but I love that sexy talk
Want to see my trick shot It 's even better
Did anyone ever tell you you 're beautiful when you 're angry
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty
It 's gon na be a long summer
Jack
What about the dope paragraph in Mr Christy 's letter
Ow
Ha
Whassamatta
Umhummmmph
Mmmmmmmph
Just a little Wait a minute woman
Lead the way
I call it my shower dream
You The brick
Looks like a storm
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures Ned is gon na do whatever he wants to do you know
Ned
I do n't love Neddy
I love you
Makes me want to hold on and never let go
Boy we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here Wait a minute I 'll get my diaphragm and be right with you
Good call
But it 's in the brochure Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program You just saw it
Those things can be nasty
Frankly Scarlet I do n't give a damn
Rocky Road
Okay Fireman
Cowboy
It 's beautiful
Sex is all you ever think of Neddy
That 's thirty percent
I know what you mean Two and a quarter Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone
One night on the town
They 'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain
Aw
You ca n't go back there tonight Not in that stuff 'Less you wanta get drownded
Anything else you want
Another coincidence
Sure
You 've made a science out of coincidence
Why not
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk
I meant me my son and my daughter
Oh that 's just my daughter in the bathroom
Vacation I 'm taking him to see his first bullfight
Just my son and I
Vamanos
Yeah follow us
It 's hardly been used at all I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years Swear to God That 's like new
You like the car
Twenty-eight
Oh Seth how can I ever make it up to you
I 'm sorry to hear that What were they psychos
No but I passed by it a couple of times It 's out in the middle of nowhere It seems like a rowdy place so there would n't be a lot of police And it 's open from dusk till dawn You said meet you in the morning
I do n't know one place 's as good as another
Whatsamatter with you Are you crazy
Why did they block the door again
Okay I 'll kill you when you change I swear to God in Jesus Christ 's name
You do n't believe in suicide
He 's running the show
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin killers I ca n't do that If you do n't tell the cops I will
They 're gon na kill her anyway At least now with all these cops we 've got a fighting chance
Dad I watch those reality shows They never let anybody go Any cop will tell you in a situation like this you get a chance you go for it This is our chance
They 're gon na kill us They get us across the border they 're gon na take us out in the desert and shoot us
No dad you got ta tell 'em that they 're back there
What are you gon na do
What 's this guy 's problem
I 'm exhausted
The truth hurts
Stop We 're not going to actually stop at a motel are we
Kate Scott
Amen
Well I say lets tear this place apart for weapons So when they burst through that door we 'll make 'em wish they never did
What 's this stuff
You all are gon na fuckin die I 'm gon na fuckin kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit
Did he
What 's an official cross Some piece of tin made in Taiwan What makes that official If a cross works against vampires it 's not the cross itself it 's what the cross represents The cross is a symbol of holiness
In other words no
Good for you Now since we all believe we 're dealing with vampires what do we know about vampires Crosses hurt vampires Do you have a cross
You too preacher
Okay does anybody here know what 's going on
Now is your shit together
To your family
What did you call me
I never said do what I do I said do what I say
I 'm gon na just sit here and drain this bottle And when I 've drunk the last drop if I still feel then the way I feel now I 'm gon na take this bottle and break it over his melon head
He 's smilin at us But behind his smile he 's sayin Fuck you Jack I hear that loud and clear
I 'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me And that fuckin bartender sticks a weed up my ass too
Suit yourself more for me Scotty
Why not against your religion
Who else
Out of the stew pot and into the fire
Then
We did our part we gotcha in Mexico Now it 's time for your part letting us go
I do n't have the slightest idea
I 'm telling you do n't hurt her
I swear to God I wo n't try to escape and I 'll do my best to get you into Mexico
Fair enough You break your word I 'll kill all of you Kate honey
I can handle Richie do n't worry
Did n't think so So as I was saying I 'm willing to make a deal You behave get us into Mexico and do n't try to escape I 'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning
Did n't like it did ya
Look dickhead the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you 're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters I do n't wan na hafta worry about you all fuckin night And I do n't think you wan na be worrying about my brother 's intentions toward your daughter all night You notice the way he looked at her did n't ya
Jesus Christ Pops do n't start with this shit
I thought so You help us get across the border without incident stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny and in the morning we 'll let you and your family go That way everybody gets what they want You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico Everybody 's happy
I seem to have touched a nerve Do n't be so sensitive Pops let 's keep this friendly But you 're right enough with the getting to know you shit Now there 's two ways we can play this hand One way is me and you go round an round all fuckin night The other way is we reach some sort of an understanding Now if we go down that first path at the end of the day I 'll win But we go down the second we 'll both win Now I do n't give a rat 's ass about you or your fuckin family Y'all can live forever or die this second and I do n't care which The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back and our money And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico Now stop me if I 'm wrong but I take it you do n't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice or the bank getting its money back Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter your son and possibly yourself Am I correct
Why 'd ya quit
Was As in not anymore
You 're a preacher
I 've seen one of these before A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion Away to fuck the IRS Is that what you 're doing or are you the real McCoy
Is this real
Whewww Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off do n't they
Died instantly
Come on gim me some more details How 'd it happen Some fuckin drunk kill her
How 'd she die
She 's dead
Where is the little lady
Who 's this
Jacob Fuller Jacob that 's biblical ai n't it What am I askin for of course it is What are their names
Yes
My children are not going with you and that 's that
If you 're taking people take me But my kids are n't going anywhere with you
Not a chance
On the dresser
Just listen to daddy sugar and do n't do nothin stupid You two Simon says sit the fuck down
It 's about money all right but not yours You see me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance
Oh well excuse me all to hell
How does that happen You do n't look Japanese
What 's the story with you two You a couple of fags
Jacob
Everybody goes home
I 'm going for 'em
I swear to God our father that when you change into one of the undead I will kill you
Okay okay I promise I 'll do it
Scott
No I 'm not I 've been bit In effect I 'm already dead
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door
Other places have beds they also have cable TV a gym room service
If it does n't have a pool we 're looking for a new place
It 's a flop house
Mom 's got nothing to say she 's dead
Kate give your old man a little credit Every person who chooses the service of God as their life 's work has something in common I do n't care if you 're a preacher a priest a nun a rabbi or a Buddhist monk Many many times during your life you 'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself am I a fool We 've all done it I 'm not going through a lapse What I 've experienced is closer to awakening I 'm not trying to shake your faith I 've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore
I did n't say fuck him I 'm just not connected anymore
Not enough to be a pastor Look I know this is hard on you kids After Jenny 's death this is probably the last thing you need But I ca n't do it any longer My congregation needs spiritual leadership Well they ca n't get that from me anymore My faith is gone To answer your question yes I do believe in Jesus But do I love them No After Jenny died I just thought what 's the point

Go out and bring it in I feel a song coming on
In that camper out there I saw a guitar I take it that 's yours
How 'bout you You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long Just do n't do nothin stupid and we 'll all get along fine Scotty you sure you do n't want a drink
Wow
Who signed as his sponsoring officer
Wickwire Thomas Dane See what you can find
Or rank But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order
Do n't say my name
More than you 'd guess It 's just that we do n't hold coffee klatches If more then three of us get together at any one time the guys think it 's some kind of uprising
Just a friend We have friends too you know
I 've been accused of that wish
Just some of the women
Can I ask you somethin lieutenant How come you 're doing this I mean we 're kinda curious
They take you away to San Clemente Island Half the guys quit when they come back Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half
Thank you ensign
Then set out the good plates we 'll all have lunch My office will follow up with details Jumping off now
Security What the hell you talkin about Your base is n't secure
Jordan dear How are they treating you
Awright How 's our girl doin anyway
Well seein 's how this thing is out you let me handle the r.p.m From this point forward I want all press matters coordinated via my office I 'll be god-damned if I 'm gon na watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one Him or the President This my shade Midnight Mahogany 'Cuz I 'm comin dangerously close to lookin like Ronald Reagan here
nothing I can do about it unless you 're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties which I 'd happily do if you 'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution
Senator they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses
Basically he asked me if I could unring a bell
Well if you had to go over my head lieutenant that 's the way to do it Christ nothin like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin
I 'm not sure what
I do n't see how O'Neil Dismissed
I find this as distasteful as you lieutenant But if it 's on my desk it 's on my shoulders There 's going to be an inquiry it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty You should prepare yourself
Sir if someone is suggesting that I 'm a lesbian they 're wrong
Permission to evaporate O'Neil
We 'll all have lunch Good idea Oh and let 's be sure to invite this sociologist too just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS
You makin friends with the press lieutenant
You 'll get everything you want O'Neil Let 's see if you want what you 're gon na get
Then good night
And if you just happen to wash out I wo n't have to contend with you bitchin to some hairy-chested female Senator And please note I did not identify any one in particular
Straight up
Well 'Least now we 're talking the same language So one standard Is that what you 're after
No sir WHAT
What I resent lieutenant is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men the day-care center I have to build where an officer 's lounge used to be and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears But most of all lieutenant I resent your perfume however subtle it may be competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty nine cent cigar which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities DOES IT
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander If so I regard that as a bonafide brain fart and I resent it when people fart inside my home
Did you just have a brain-fart
Because I was civil now you 're complaining
Oh really
All right lieutenant give me a name and specifics I 'll have the X.O file an action first thing in the morning A name
Pardon the hour sir But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way
Sir I just want you to know I 'm not here to make a statement I do n't want to make men look foolish All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience just like everyone else I suspect
None at this time sir
Really I have no problem with
Barber was my next stop sir Would 've had it regulation sooner only
So We 're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this for integrating the Spec-Recon training It may not always be smooth but we 're trying to make it as painless as possible for you
Would you care for a beverage Tea
Yes of course Please have a seat lieutenant
Entering my scan now
No problem sir
Motherachrist
Sir
O'Neil Our air 's gon na crap out as soon as we get down there You know that do n't you
Fuck me
Hey Ai n't your call man
I ai n't gon na shoot her
Shit Think we 're had
She made it through S.E.R.E training Got a call this morning from
Yes
Think I overplayed it
'S AIDE White House boys want a private meeting
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier
I 'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of
I was one member of the investigating commission
Madam Senator this is an internal document of the U.S Navy I must seriously question whether
Well I 'm just an old dame without much time left so you 'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type I am deeply concerned over the Navy 's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military Case in point
Whoa whoa whoa Land-based maritime specialties Gim me a second here to de-euphemize that
Well I spoke with Mr Hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off No more test cases He was only too happy to oblige Do n't play politics with me little darlin You 'd be up way past your bedtime
You 'll think about my offer
I 've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began And that 's quite verifiable
I once promised you a fast ticket Jordan and I always meant to make good on that Come work for me I can always use a hard-charger on my team
The reality is this We send far too many men off to war I do n't need to compound the problem with women Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with
Jordan I do n't expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there 's more to be gained from the fight than the victory
I 'm saying it 's not going to happen Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags
In face I do Roper Harris Gallop they all come back the same
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire Because he knows what I know that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way
If I have to ask again Senator I 'll be asking in front of cameras
What changed
Absolutely not
Jordan Might we do this over lunch tomorrow I do very much want to talk but now is scarcely
Sounds familiar
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire
Gon na be visiting that all-woman 's America 's cup team in a few weeks If I were a gambler I 'd say Dennis O'Conner 's days are numbered But they 're in San Diego so I thought I 'd take a quick promenade of the base
Hmmm Maybe I 'll ask when I see you in person
There 'll be more to follow but yes dear right now you 're the pick of a very large litter And your success would mean a lot Jumping now
Yes dear
My office will fill him in and help expedite Look forward to meeting you at the proper time Jumping off now
This is just a test case O'Neil But if it works out if you work out it could well change the Navy 's official policy on women in combat Or actually its official non-policy Now who 's your immediate superior there
California
High-school pentathlete ROTC scholarship graduated with honors top marks in Basic Training and as it just so happens a constituent of my home state of Virginia Oh the things I 'll do for one extra vote
So everyone I talk to says you 're top drawer with silk stockings inside
OFFICER 1 I think it 's more important sir to decide what we 're going to do since it 's apparent this issue is not going away quietly
OFFICER 1 Does n't matter who she picks No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course And I do n't care who it is
OFFICER 1 I 'd go Special Reconnaissance Every bit as tough and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men
Spotted you Chief Pri One is to slip you some air so we 're coming down with a tank just something until the A-team shows Over
Flea 'Cool Cortez Newman take your minis hit the water Go GO
Fuck Basher-Basher this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction Stand by for a PRC fix
'Snot me It 's him
Do that
Well Flea I appreciate the respect you just showed me But I do n't need it and do n't want it not that kind of respect anyway It 's just gon na hurt us both okay
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size
Montgomery why do they call you Flea
Sir
JOHNS Flea O'Neil Why is there a break in that line
JOHNS If you ca n't feel the other guy 's pecker you ai n't in tight enough I want nuts to butts
JOHNS two one MARK
JOHNS Do n't have to use it O'Neil but it 's got ta go out Five four three
PYRO I oughtta report you
PYRO She 's a women and that 's why you 're ridin her bareback
PYRO She 's a trainee just like the others Why are you coming down so hard
PYRO You broke a dozen training rules back there before I lost count
PYRO Get it up
CHIEF Every class has its surprises Pyro This one 'll be no different
CHIEF Check your watch Pyro Seems fast
PYRO Maybe it 's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts But I think the Chief knew that his way his world had come and gone
PYRO The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday By 18-hundred he was gone Out of the Navy
PYRO I believe he earned it for saving a man 's life in Saudi Arabia He wanted you to have it He was very clear on that point
What all females If I 'm the only
PYRO You 'll try what we tell you to try O'Neil Go regulation
PYRO Not doin them very fine O'Neil
Yes Jordan I 'll wait for you no matter how long
Look It 's not like you 'd be completely out of reach And maybe we could call in a few favors get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado There are ways of dealing with these things I mean if people are so inclined
Yeah Me too
You do n't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country He 's got a Sea Daddy somewhere
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado
In Washington
I do n't know I do n't care
Sounds like an amazing coincidence
What about him
Well before you crawl off to die Jordan give me five minutes of good headwork
Someone screwed you over like this left unanswered charges hanging over your head and you 're not gon na fight back
C'mon Jordan Do the headwork with me
No shortage of suspects
Maybe Though it did n't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it Almost like Did I say he was class officer
All I wanted was an honest chance And If I could n't get it I could n't stay
Jordan You watch your ass
That 's not what I want Jordan I mean it is and it is n't
I 'm only trying to warn you in case
Big symbols make big targets Jordan I think someone 's gunning for you
I ca n't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about G.I Jane You 're all over the place and whether you wanted it or not the feminists are sizing you up for that poster
Do n't you know How they 're talking about you
Well not this I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago Got some fresh stuff about you You may be in a hostile camp I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn
That bad
It 's hard to find time to sleep Royce Much less keep up with my phone life
Thank you Royce It was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy Really thank you so much
You know right up until you said that I thought I did know
Which is guy-speak for
Wai wait What happens if it works Four months of training three years of operational duty What then
Sorry But after our days So if I try this thing if I ship out to Coronado what happens here
Get your dick back here It has everything to do with you
This has nothing to do with you
You need operational duty to really advance you need combat training to go operational yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits I 'm topped out at Intel Forget the glass ceiling I 'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling
Royce We 're the same age we started the same time and now you 're sitting in the upperdecks while I 'm still down in the bullpen What does that tell you about the Navy
I take it you do n't either Feet
Just like you would be
Is this my glory sir
Intel has its own glory lieutenant no matter how subtle
Probably hear back from CNN first
That was good headwork lieutenant
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back Is that correct O'Neil
Blank faces here O'Neil
Halfway 'round the world So that 's the problem we can get the team in just not out
You 're the analyst for East China O'Neil Analyze
Signals received only sparingly in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries
Not due in for 22 minutes sir Watcha got
Lieutenant O'Neil
I 'm sorry O'Neil But as class officer it 's my obligation to report all violations
We 're going over to her place to make salad and pasta Just you know nothing special
Do you uh know
I think you look beautiful
Maybe I 'll just head over to McP 's with the others have a drink or four Do n't wan na come do you
That 's okay Just an ex-girlfriend And know I remember why
Let 's keep talkin Wick Just keep talkin to me
How 'd you make it last time Wick How 'd you get through this part
Not me You
At first
So the shit you got ta go through To get from here to there Brother said it was worth it Worth the training worth the divorce worth anything
Nah they were dead-ass asleep But on every guard 's chest they left one Marlboro cigarette Just a little calling card to say they 'd been there and could come back any time they wanted
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline This is like right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense So his crew does a nighttime infil maps all the big artillery placements and stuff then turns around to get the hell gone But between them and the water are five Libyan guards all armed to the nuts
When I was sittin behind a desk in Washington it made sense somehow Blame it on my big brother He was Spec-Recon And the stories he used to tell
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast They found his tracks Well shit
You know I had an apartment about this size once
Thanks Wick
You 're kind of a surprise yourself
Made it to Week 10 last time
It was made clear Anyway stay ballsy First week 's hell then it levels out Until S.E.R.E training anyway That 's hell-and-a-half
It was made clear before you came harassment equals career suicide Ca n't say anything good so they do n't say much at all To your face anyway
They 're more afraid of you
Maybe half Not even
Smoke it
I 'm lookin I 'm lookin
Mighta been civilian
I do n't know
What you gon na give it all up for a maple twist How dumb you got ta be That 's exactly what they
What 're you guys doing Huh
CHIEF O'Neil
CHIEF Got it
CHIEF Say again How many micks
CHIEF Managed to activate the ELB If you just radio base and let them know they 'll fix on that Oh and make sure they send a helo with a winch door 's blocked by a reef Over
Good to see you again too sir
CHIEF I think we oughtta practice it just so you know what to expect
CHIEF Did n't you know you 'd be raped if you were captured Did n't you even think about that
No
CHIEF You think we should go easy on women O'Neil
CHIEF I 'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage You wear the bars you made the call and you got your whole crew
CHIEF That 's what your crew said Are they lying Or are you
CHIEF The others already told me O'Neil They wanted to shoot but you would n't let them Because you went soft on another women
CHIEF Would you have shot if it was a man
Was n't deemed a threat
CHIEF Right down to your worthless womb and I 'll tell you why This is my island My world And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world Take another scan of my little joy boy outside If I can do that to a Navy Seal what 's gon na happen to you Huh
CHIEF You are in the cage O'Neil Right here right now
CHIEF Are you hungry What 's your favorite food We 'll try to get it for you
CHIEF Any brothers Sisters
CHIEF Simple question lieutenant No reason not to answer What is your father 's name
McCool 's that same rank We 're both j.g 's
It also seems like a problem with the men 's attitude sir So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead
CHIEF Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear lieutenant
CHIEF For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia
CHIEF It seems the men could n't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs Israeli men would linger over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission often endangering their own lives They do n't use women anymore
CHIEF Educate her Pyro
CHIEF You heard me Move on
Shut your hole Slutnik
FLEA KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT Mark it mark it Cortez What the hell you waiting for
Cortez see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear Try a wrench on that thing

Darth Vader reads poetry
SPOOK This is what you get for brain picking an old CIA spook but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case that 's how I 'd do it A man-in-place Makes everything very controllable
SPOOK Okay so now work it from the other end Think about California and how things might be handled there
SPOOK I take it this file is still open
SPOOK This ai n't about some little soldier girl sloggin her way through commando school The implications go way beyond
SPOOK If you were the President would n't that put a little piss in your shoes
SPOOK Do n't for a second think she did n't leak this story G.I Jane gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all
SPOOK The White House If Jordan wins DeHaven wins in spades Why Well it 's been said that the only man the President fears ai n't no man
Possibly Just to spite DeHaven
The Navy They 've made it clear they do n't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women 's heads What 's it gon na cost to make a fleet of Trident 's co-ed
The E-Ringers Full integration is gon na cost the services billions at the worst possible time when Congress is already swinging the axe
SPOOK Sorry Thought you knew I knew
SPOOK Thought you two were file-closed
SPOOK Subject

Oh my God They 're coming
Your station wo n't have any easier time contacting the military than I did
Our network covers the Ranger games
Come on the broadcast booth is right over here
Circuits are overloaded
I thought you said there 'd only be a dozen eggs
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes
I should n't have to Audrey You 're supposed to be my friend I trusted you
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen
Yes Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time
The ultimate expression of evolution it reproduces asexually Think about it all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction That 's why he came to New York Like every species of insufficient progenitors he 's nesting
Well obviously these tests were n't designed for this but fundamentally they 're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy
he 's pregnant
I got pretty close
Yes The first of its kind I found this blood sample earlier this evening
I have this theory that we 're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we 've done to nature
When you and I use to attend rallies in college we helped to create awareness But from the inside now I can actually effect change I never lost my idealism

No it 's still in my tent It 's oh my God she took it
It may be too late by then These eggs will hatch very quickly
No it reproduces asexually That 's why we must find the nest If we do n't dozens will be born each one capable of laying eggs of its own Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population
HICKS You see all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do n't rely on heat seeking
When I needed to catch earthworms I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them I had to draw them out
You know he 's not an enemy trying to evade you He 's just an animal
HICKS Do n't tell me why it 's not tell me what the hell it is
HICKS It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over

HICKS Seventeen percent huh Sounds big
HICKS No but I have the feeling I 'm about to find out

HICKS Follow me
HICKS Right The worm guy Can someone get those people off the beach
HICKS Dr Niko Topopolosis
HICKS Organize a search party I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system
HICKS We 're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body
HICKS That 's not true Our worm guy er I mean Dr Tatopoulos found blood
HICKS General Anderson the problem was the terrain If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park We should be able to take him down
HICKS We think there 's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area
I just wanted to say au revoir and thank you for your help my friend
Where are you
Hello
Who the hell are you
What 'd they say
How do I do that
Good idea
You were right

Makes us look more American
Are you kidding I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion
Here 23rd street subway station Where we first found the fish With a little luck this will lead us right to it
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific
Sure
I am not permitted to speak of such things
This is America There is nothing you can not buy
We have already taken care of them
I need your trust if you 're to help me find the nest
I need you to trust me
We know
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature 's nest
It 's the French Secret Service
SDECE Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage Agent Phillip Raymond

Purple skinned monstrosity
Hundreds dead all so you could play at being the Commander You 've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch
That 's your problem You were never serious about the caraft I 'm a rock I just want to be a rock Still Peaceful Tranquil Oh but what 's this Something 's making noise No not noise no MOVEMENT VIBRATIONS Make the vibrations stop they go straight into me like a knife I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations
Well you have to figure out what it wants What 's its motivation
KILL IT Well I 'm open to ideas
I heard something A squeal
What What
You go first There 's no time
Must be some sort of mining facility

Come on old friend
You have a better plan Alex
Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps
Hey watch that Laredo shit
You know with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second
You were holding it upside down were n't you
What 's happened
Could you possibly try not to hit every single one
He wants to THINK
What the hell is going on
Settle down Alex
Not again
He 's a twit
He always has to make the big entrance
No I did n't
What
Down there
It does n't make sense Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures
Nobody was WATCHING
Could they be the miners
To see if there 's a pub
Go into the cloud
WE 'VE HAVE TO STOP
May I get the check
We heard it the first time
Oh my god It 's real
I do n't know It just was n't like him
You could order something in
Why did n't you stop at the market
Oh ca n't I Watch me
Dear God How did I come to this
The guy is terminally selfish
We 'd better get everybody online And Kyle Stop downloading porn Your frame rate is unacceptable
You 've got the utility systems walkthrough right
No time for pleasantries Kyle We have a level five emergency The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads
He probably Has some very important business to attend to
Yeah What 's wrong JASON othIno I ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat

Lt Madison GO
Wait two seconds then go

BRANDON TIME TO GO
How did you come to that conclusion
But you do n't
What do you mean
What does the Omega 13 do
Brandon Just in case I die there 's something I have to know
Yes
We 'd never have the budget for this
Now make a right you 'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility The bowels of the ship
Okay now left at the next turn Past the oxygen units Make a right there Then go through the antimatter vent
Okay we got it
I knew it I KNEW it
But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase okay I understand completely that It 's just a TV show There is no ship there is no Beryllium Sphere no diagital conveyor I mean obviously it 's all just a
Yes I know and I want you to know I thought about what you said I know you meant it constructively but
Brandon
Oh Oh I see Oh
Yes
Yes but we were wondering
Commander as I was saying In The Quasar Dilemma you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix so we were wondering where the error lies
Commander please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having In The Quasar Dilemma the Sentient had taken control of the ship 's guidance systems however
Systems register functional
Systems register functional
Negative no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard
Negative The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress
The enemy is matching velocity
Guys we 're sustaining structural damage
I never get tired of that joke
What 's the weather like outside
I just ca n't believe it Any of it Look at this room They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from historical document thirty seven Oh and wait wait listen to this Computer
Structural damage at 68 percent
TECH So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate A two molecule compound sharing a free electron and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes
TECH What does that mean Yes I see Yes It means that perhaps the bonding molecules have become covalent
TECH That possibly The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally
Hopkins ca n't drink your bathwater Fred
You worked with Hopkins I worship Hopkins
Listen Fred You did this for four years on the show You can do it now Put your hands on the controls
I 'll take my chances with Gorignak
The digital conveyer You mean I 'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces
Never mind Fred
I Well uh Yes absolutely
Maybe you 're the plucky comic relief you ever think of that
It 's suicide
We 've got to get that valve turned off Their oxygen Is almost gone
The digital conveyor
You Okay Alex
How do you remember this stuff
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram
I am SO SICK of being right
Oh they 're so cute
Where are the miners
Guy you HAVE a last name We just do n't KNOW it
The Omega 13 Why does that sound so familiar
THAT 'S why you built this ship
Crewman 6 Call me Guy
Listen I was wondering would you guys mind if I sit in today See if anybody 's interested in an autograph Never know
We~re oetting hammered Jason Return fIre
I know You contruct a weapon Look around can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe
It 's a rough plan Guy What does it matter if we 're doing episode 31 or not
It does n't have to be a hologram Just a diversion
That 's it that 's what 's going to kill me
We 're screwed We 're so screwed
It 's I do n't know
Your last name
Guy you 're not going to get killed on the planet okay
They 're still behind us
Okay

More to the left Stay parallel
Hey Thanks for one nice intro uh
TOMMY 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT
Mark 12
Well forget it I 'm not going This episode was badly written
We should n't have to DO this It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE Why is it HERE
What IS that thing It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK
There 's no hatch There 's no hatch
Uh I hate to break it to you Jason but I do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor and unless you took a Learning Annex course I do n't know about I 'm pretty sure you do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either
So We get to shut down the neutron reactor
Jason I do n't think the pig lizard was Gorignak
Wait the pig lizard is gone Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard
What What did he say
Yeah But I 've got Gorignak staring me in the face I think I can take it though
Yes Yes I 'm here
Will you stop RIDING ME
It helps
Why does this sound so familiar
Do n't be ridiculous
I could have held on to YOU
Self control That 's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard
Can it be repaired
Are they behind us
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud
I thought It was the We 're dead gesture I was agreeing Like I know where the hold button is
You just keep pushing those buttons those there send everything at him okay
We 're going to fire everything we 've got at him all right
All right now nobody panic I 've dealt with this guy before and believe me he 's as stupid as he is ugly
There 's nobody here Jason
We 're leaving Jason We 're leaving NOW
We have no right to do this They deserve to know
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment ACTING Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon she taught ACTING
Well you have to tell them What if something happens We 're actors not astronauts We ca n't do this stuff
Who we are Do n't you think they 're going to be PISSED
Wait When are you going to tell them
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says So that 's what they built
Only answers to me
Oh come on it 's not like I haven't
It 's Jason

Accelerate to Mark 4 Tommy
We We lie

Explain
Wait What did you say
No I swear I do n't know Please
Stop please I do n't know
I do n't know
Yes
You have ten seconds
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship
Better than my Lieutenant He failed to activate ship 's neutron armor as quickly as I 'd hoped on our last encounter
Okey dokey let 's fire blue particle cannons full Fire red particle cannons full Fire gannet magnets left and right Fire pulse catapults from all chutes And throw this thing at him too killer
You can oc that
It 's difficult to On our planet we pretend in order to entertain
Sections of rooms made of plywood Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster The digital conveyor was Christmas lights Decorations It 's all a fake I 'm not him I 'm a nothing A nobody
A model only as big as this
I 'm not a Commander there is no National Space Exploration Administration There is no snip
Well Sort of
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations The fault must lie with us with the ship
A thousand apologies We have failed you
Mathesar What is that
Commander
Former Commander
Then how did he find out about the device
Mathesar Has Sarris seen the historical records
To our brave guests Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes We are blessed to count ourselves among them
It 's perfectly safe I promise
It was a lot of fun You kids are great
Thanks
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134 's a parking lot after 2:00 But listen the guy gives you any more trouble just give a call
Oh I do n't think so I gave him both barrels
Long live Theramini Take a left here
Right Long live What 's your planet
Yeah Earth Time to get back to Earth kids
Home
As you wish
Commander Welcome to the Protector II Would you like to don your uniform
Sir I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol but please I beg you to hear our plea We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey Sarris wants the Omega 13 We are to meet in negotiation However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous The flames the death Please Captain you are our last hope We have secured a limousine
I certainly but
Commander I must speak to you It is a matter of supreme importance We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula and we require your help I beseech you to come with us back to our ship A great many lives hang in the balance
Hold course Laredo
Commander Call me Laredo
Pedal to the metal
Practice driving Tommy
All right guys Uh Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually Fred you and Guy need to get that air valve back on Alex see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy ca n't get the oxygen back in time
NO NO NO
The throat the mouth Its vulnerable spots
Go for the eyes Like in episode 22 with
How about the pig-lizard
Good work Tommy Let 's go
Okay let 's go
Tommy we have these
Anything
All right Gwen Alex Fred follow me Guy set up the perimeter Tommy you keep a lookout make a signal if they come back
Do your best Tommy
Could be this
Faster Tommy Get us out of here
Where
Well it 's This was a device we discovered on an alien planet We do n't know what it does either
Excuse me
What 's going on
Wh Where are we
And determination
I did n't say that I said would n't it be great if we could always work together That 's what I said
Fire at will hI~D NT PROTECTOR
WHAT WH
enerao I 've host them The maanetlsm o the field Is disrupting our onstru ait There they are
But sir my MEN The core implosion is not reversible
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort
Patience Lt Patience
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods probably their whores
What does she see in them
I wish she was beneath me
Well now there 's something worth dying for What do you think
Some say that Hessians are invincible
These men were taken from their homes at night tried by Reed 's courts which Congress recognizes and well you can see
They love Reed and his inquisition I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits It 's becoming the American way
That scum Joseph Reed they 're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania The man 's a budding Cromwell He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates their property for himself Naturally the pig hates me for every Tory I 've saved
I 'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed
There then you can have sort of a normal life
Gates He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he 'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack George why have n't you moved into the Potts house back at the creek Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent And you could entertain I think you need to entertain more Seriously Get a few New Jersey whores up here invite some Congressmen could n't hurt
That ca n't be
Same old story
Exactly We 'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard It would cause the line to buckle Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half
Our plan is to hit them as they leave
Well George who were you
We 're so damned important Look at us Nathanael you were a horse shoer Benedict before this
Christ George Joseph Reed 's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you Your own aide
Someday George you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is It may come down to us or them someday You or them Cicero was right was is a time when the laws are silent
The army can survive without me
Do n't do anything rash please Benedict
It is
Congress is talking openly about replacing you with Lee
The man 's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief
But trust you to do what One side in Congress wants compromise another glorious battle some surrender some of course just want power and money But if you do n't mind my asking George what are your plans
Oh they have reasons there 's a lot of confusion these days
Congress has picked up it 's skirts and is racing for Baltimore They 're not waiting for spring Of course they still had time to deny my promotion Even John Adams voted against it
I 've come to report that we 've had a bit of luck
It comes down to leaders If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe if they go into the forests with the troops eat what they eat fight with them perhaps to die The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation
And a French alliance
Well you fought with them against the French and Iroquois how good were they then
Exceedingly Besides if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress I could move a whole army to the moon
Over three hundred miles
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine If we do n't do it the British will come down Champlain take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring
We 've got to attack the British Now Have they put you in charge yet Do we have an army yet What is happening
Well what have you thought
Wil I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth
LEE No I guess
LEE Yes general
LEE Yes general
Yes William I am apologizing
LEE That you would have known you can trust me
LEE A lot of years have gone by
LEE Well I misunderstood then
LEE Yes General But if you have to shoot somebody you ca n't
LEE You you just need a new flint General
LEE Colonel sir Mrs Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner
By red what rank would you say this black officer soldier is Colonel
Negroes Washington has black men in his army Are they good fighters What 's that red ribbon on his arm Colonel
And is that a pitchfork beside him
What sort of boots would you say he 's wearing I should say no sort of boots at all Are n't those rags wrapped around his feet Is that what he marched here in
No uniforms No coats even In this weather
LEE That 's Greene He 's supporting our reconsolidation
What do you know about these men They can stand against anything They 've seen more war than most field generals They are not cowards sir They are not afraid
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing
LEE I am to take command of Major General Lafayette 's division and lead the attack
General Lee welcome back I 'm happy you 've decided to join us
That 's why the people trust you George Without someone at the convention who has the people behind him everything will fail Will you do it
George you 're the only man the people trust trust with power They know you wo n't betray them
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention
Yes I believe so
March on Philadelphia Get Joseph Reed and the pigs in Congress the speculators who 've grown fat off the war Get them all Sweep them aside
Is this a coup Alexander are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I do n't agree
To hell with Arnold
No one knows
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and can not pay the soldiers pensions
I am not conscious of it sir But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we part
Sir Arnold is a traitor
Sir I think no such thing
Yessir
General Greene is here There are two other divisions here
What are we going to do
It 's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter you might as well stop geese from migrating
Are you going to keep him sir
I was a clerk 's apprentice on Saint Croix But then I went to King 's College
They 're among the best divisions the British have No conscripts no impressed recruits just professional killers
That young school teacher I heard the British hung him as a spy
Captain I want you to know that I respect your openness It would make me happy if you 'd join our table for dinner from now on
General Washington is there actually going to be a compromise I mean a 'deal with England
I 'm so inclined
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I But if victory is remote and there 's any hope for a negotiated peace we must keep this army intact
Delighted sir
I 'll be twenty next year sir
Then use rocks
Hamilton you 're going to have to cover our asses as we cross
GATES George we 've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army
GATES Who 's in command out there
GATES Good day Mister Adams George what 's the word from Boston
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went
Of course the army will acquit him that 's not the point Arnold is a man and will understand What I need to understand is John Sam what is happening here Who are those people in there The fat ones in silk
Lafayette is my friend He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind so of course he 's a child But he would have died before he would have let me down
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them Unlike General Lee who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent
ADAMS Colonel Charles Lee Hounds and all Quite the character He 's got a tremendous reputation
ADAMS You wo n't be needing his largess Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment
ADAMS With your support Horatio As one of our own who has seen combat with the British your opinion counts
Well John Adams your cousin has a marvelous gift
ADAMS Partially
ADAMS Finally It 's people like these who as soon as they get a little power want more and more More ale here
ADAMS He has the soul of an aristocrat who 'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people
ADAMS You invented this this
ADAMS Gag on your own invention then
ADAMS I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored General Washington Champion of Trenton Savior of the Republic And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress
ADAMS Hancock led the Boston 'tea party because he 's a goddamned tea smuggler He was n't protesting inequality he was eliminating competition Now you listen to me we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief or the south will not fight What have we been struggling for all these years For this moment And if we fail now remember you stopped us
ADAMS Washington is perfect He 's a Southerner he 's a war hero and he 's rich
REED Unofficially General Greene
REED Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army
REED The British army sir
REED General Lee is detained captain
REED No officer is going to get these men to fight They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island At the most perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost then retire to protect Congress
REED Did God ever make such a pitiful army
GREENE I doubt Arnold will be afraid
REED Well I shall deny him to you He is evil on earth
How can you say that
Gentlemen let me get to the point I ca n't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold
REED Understand You need to be listening to people like John Adams and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind
REED And Hamilton Greene
REED George I 'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide I see where we 're headed you 're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold
REED But the Hessians are there No one can beat them That 's why Cornwallis stationed them there They have the post of honor They are invincible
I mean I 'm a Deist A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin Surely you knew that
REED To assert the rights of our founding fathers This country was colonized by Christians This shall become a Christian revolution Surely as a good Christian you understand that
REED A ground swell-Christian movement George you see
REED Well George Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property I would n't cast my fate with that man
REED That damned Arnold is here is n't he Did you know he lost all his ships Outrageous and completely unacceptable
Colonel Reed
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now we have to hold on here our men must believe they can win the British must believe that somehow in some mad impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them
My God They mean to finish us What about Arnold He 's up there
REED Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain
I will continue with our French allies concentrating on New York
Get these men back in line
My God Who ordered this retreat
What is it Marquis
Like flowers after the snow melts
Because if the British got off their asses and came up here now we would be smashed And the revolution would be finished Tell King Louis it 's that bad
I rode here on my horse
Sir these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville They are a gift from the people of France
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets
I only meant
I am Then I understand you too serve without salary You know since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton the French court is softening I expect any time now a ship load of supplies
Mon General I have come here to learn and to give not to take I am serving without salary
The one with 'Philadelphia spelled correctly is the counterfeit
'Continentals Congress paper money It was worthless to start with but as you see counter feiters have made them even less than worthless Can you tell which one is fake
Gentlemen my I introduce a French gentleman recently appointed major general by Congress Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier Marquis de Lafayette General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen and how many cases of muskets Mon petite Marquis
Sir please accept my commission from Congress and You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife Adrienne we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left Her name is Henriette
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with
I do n't want to see your hospital
Not today
Leave me now sir I am tired
Well we must keep in mind the Dower Laws One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding it would be legally impossible to distinguish them
Do n't condescend to me We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind
Some things must never change
Oh indeed You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes They beg you to consider the future What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army There 's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests
Well I would n't want to trouble you with this now
It 's an anti-Christian dogma I can not believe you are so calm about it
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church
That 's right
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven Devotion to country duty purity of heart Purity of heart I was drunk on something then
Liberty Virtue Country That 's from Cato you know that play about the noble Romans As I was riding up to Philadelphia I found myself thinking about the old days
But as usual it will not go well for them Martha you must trust me
And what 'prize do you see What could we possible gain
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say If he had his way all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated to be destroyed
Well a very real expectation is the British will hang you They 'll burn Mount Vernon and they 'll hang you Our marriage is a business just as surely as
My God what
But to go to war over trade over money Surely there 's still time for a compromise
War No I did not When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable There 's no middle ground at all We 're the King 's children
My God these people mean to go to war They really mean it
You know I came back to Mount Vernon to retire I do n't need to be in government
GREENE It is we need you George
GREENE Yes sir it 's a wise idea
GREENE Sir I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform
Nathanael I 'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army to harass Cornwallis Marquis you must go with him
GREENE What the hell are we doing
At one time I could have chosen not to be
I will not betray you Nathanael
You do n't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism
You have a free tongue Captain Hamilton
Yes I thought that 's how you 'd feel Nathanael
General Greene
I certainly did n't mean you Of course you are a gentleman an officer and a gentleman
Nathanael someone bred to station bred to being a gentleman unlike these men his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them Fifty lashes each
A horseshoer
But you do come from a military family
It is n't my army yet Colonel Greene Looks like you 've seen some action did you hurt your leg in a fight
Yes yes happy to meet you
GREENE Yessir
GREENE We 're leaving them
Mankind is born free but everywhere he is in chains
Well I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements but which I now see means us all
You remember George when we were 'studying the great philosophers
Now that is a lie See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis I 'll divorce William Do you hear You get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love
Is it William says now you have requested a British Commission why not colonial I 'll clear it up for you sir because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels more than that it will even get you into polite society Your dream come true George the only dream that really matters to you
And what is this then Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot Or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war
George you know I only love you but
You know very well who it is that I love
Words words words Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies is n't that right
Hear that George Sally 's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home And it 's her first tour We 're gratified are n't we George
We can grow three primary crops in a season and if we have some luck we get a forth The temperature is generally mild
Oh but you must not mind my talking about you In fact William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest English gentleman out of you
So you are William 's wild young neighbor Or should I say 'brother William claims you as a member of his family I have heard so many unflattering tales about you and I understand that except for you this 'family is quite cultivated
WASHINGTON That 's good who
And dost thou live to ask it
I 've been surprised in an unguarded hour But must not now go back the love that lay Half smothered in my breast has broke through all Its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre I can not if I would conceal it from thee
WASHINGTON They can use their imaginations
WASHINGTON You 're out of your mind
WASHINGTON What are you doing
I do n't laugh at you George I like you I like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat and that 's because you 're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them
Is it Well I 'm scared of what we 've become in our freedom
Do you When I saw those men yesterday in the field and the women and children in those hovels I 'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I 'd hoped
The place to want to be is America Every English child dreams of it I dreamt it
Perhaps you best ask why you wish it You asked William to teach you manners philosophy decorum as I said it 's completely stupid
It 's stupid of course
That 's just my interpretation Actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners You see Walk in a gently Z There are four distinct movements
In the minuet George every movement is significant like the strut of cranes
The word 'minuet finds its source in minitus which is Latin meaning 'small or 'orderly
Capture them Well I 've never seen anything like it so of course I 'm curious
Africa That 's so far How do they get here
Where do those men come from George
ADAMS Is that your test of patriotism George if a man will die for you
That I hear a mob unemployed drunkards vagabonds the world 's dregs
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war You know why I do n't trust revolutions Because each of us is who we are we make speeches print pamphlets and we never change The world is not a philosophical abstraction Mister Adams it 's us And I do n't believe you can ever change human nature
I see
Who says so
Just because they are born
That land belongs to the strongest
Do n't be silly you have whole worlds to fathom
He was not black He was tan Weathered
For God sake get that horrid stuff off your face You look like a damned slave It 's damned humiliating

He knew it was a set up He was ready for it
CATLETT Does n't matter what it 's called Harry 's got Martin Weir and it 's gon na be big
CATLETT And I mean high up in it That 's why Harry 's gon na make Mr Lovejoy with me not Chili Palmer
Cat that 's the lamest idea I 've ever heard
You did n't have to shoot him Bo We coulda just beat him up some
No shit What 're some of 'em
So how many movies you been in
How 'bout when you went down the stairs
What 're you hanging around with a guy like that for You were in the movies right A stuntman What 's he ever done he can talk about You feel okay
Look there 's no fuckin way I 'm gon na give you the key outside of you point a gun at my head Then we might have something to talk about Now step away from the car
Catlett says if you do n't open the locker the deal 's off
I have to ask you for that key
You spotted them huh
So you did n't have the key with you
I went to UC San Diego We 're gon na spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton We 're gon na take the tour See the shark Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular After we 'll come here get our money

What money
Yeah well we need a ride somewhere we 'll let you know
CATLETT That 's all
CATLETT There 's nothin to know You have an idea you write down what you wan na say Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong if you are n't positive yourself Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words although I 've seen scripts where I know words were n't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all So I do n't think it 's too important Anyway you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out and that 's the end you 're done
She 's been out of movies a few years but she 's good Real good
Yeah I read it I was just thinking you could make her older We might even be able to get Karen Flores
She 's young
Get something going there
There 's Ilona
Title 's the first thing 's got to go And the guy 's name I mean even this writer 's name Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy
Yeah Morgan Freeman But he 's a colored guy
Harvey Keitel Yeah Maybe He was pretty good in the movie Fingers
I put a gun right here and I tell him 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin dead Like that
Yeah we 're getting Martin
That 's right me
It 's what he said I 'm his associate
I 'd never make you as a burglar not in that outfit
That 's funny I was just wondering what I was gon na break of yours to get it away from you

CATLETT All I want in return is to work on the movie with you Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up
CATLETT Listen Harry how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand You pay me back at your convenience no interest
Chili Palmer showed you my script

Are you the guy they called Ray Bones
Ray Barboni
Look there 's no reason you and I should n't get along Forget all the bullshit from before  I do n't even remember how it started You took a swing at me over some fuckin thing whatever it was  forget it You owe me some money right Forget that too But you do n't say a fuckin word about this to anybody It 's strictly between you and me right
You found Leo did n't you Took the poor asshole 's money and put it in a locker ready to go Why have n't you left

'Cause the guy 's a customer now stupid His ass belongs to me
Do n't insult me Get up and turn around

He owes me money
What like that 's supposed to mean something to me

Anyway you want this guy he 's in L.A We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself See if he wants to invest in my movie

Never say anything unless you have to
I do n't know maybe I was n't clear But I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
You 're kidding right
That 's right they 're wondering who 's this guy You do n't tell 'em Understand Harry Do not tell 'em who I am
No leave 'em up we want the light in their eyes I 'll be at the desk but do n't introduce me let it go just start talking You 're gon na be here behind 'em when they sit down
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel watching the bar across the street getting his video camera ready for action What 's he doing Following a guy
What do you get out of this
You do n't even know these guys
Just a thought
That or I 'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin 
Doris Murray 's widow finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract she wants five hundred grand for the script
He drown
So what 's the problem
She 's a rock star Every day same time they come down here and have breakfast He has the egg white omelet she has the banana pancakes He sits facing west so he can see his billboard She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades
Ride the Clouds Good picture
One of his best parts
Two time academy award nominee Martin Weir
Murray Saffrin guy who wrote it did all my Grotesque pictures had it in a drawer for twenty years He shows it to me one day tells me he 's got a star interested would I produce it
Mr Lovejoy That 's the title
What 's it called
For a movie
You got that on the brain Harry If you 're so scared of 'em why 'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with
You 're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid and that 's hard to do Let 's just get to where you 're at okay You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you have n't told 'em about it Why not
These guys my investors they run a limo service came to me originally put money in a few of my pictures and did okay they 're happy So they come in on another deal  this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake The characters there 's this seven hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys gets them in her trailer 
I 've been picked up a couple times Loan sharking Racketeering But I was never convicted I 'm clean
Once
Maybe a few times I have
Not really
They always paid
What I did till recently After I get done here I 'll think about what I 'm gon na do next
So you do n't work for the casino
But you work for the casino
You would n't be talking to me if you were
Wait a minute you 're not the guy are you The dry cleaner
The shylock He 's barely mentioned And it 's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast
That 's half a movie with holes in it Maybe forty minutes of screen time You do n't even have a girl a female lead and on top of that there 's no one to sympathize with you do n't have a good guy
That 's it That 's your movie
So he comes to L.A
Keep going
Without him The guy 's so out of it he does n't even know it 's gone
It 's the kind of situation you do n't pay you get your legs broken
You just did
Karen it 's a pleasure How you doing
I produce feature motion pictures no TV You mentioned Grotesque that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen
Fuckin basketball game
You gon na get rough now threaten me I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken
Why do I have to keep looking at you
They do n't want to deposit yours and have it bounce That annoys them So your dear friend Dick Allen 's been calling leaving messages on your machine but you never get back to him I happen to be in Vegas on another matter and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up I follow you over here see you in the window with this woman looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores was in Grotesque except she 's not blond anymore
A marker 's like a check Harry
Operator how do I get Las Vegas Information
Dick Allen 's a very dear friend of mine How far you want to go with this
That 's what I 'm doing
I 'm looking at you
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack
Have we met I do n't recall
Jesus if I have a heart attack I hope you know what to do
Twenty seven hundred
Ask your man here
E.g means 'for example Ray I think what you wan na say is i.e
Hey it 's your book now You want to check it out go ahead He 's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway
It was in the Herald
Yeah Ray he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines jet went down last month
Yeah he told me
He died
Hey Bones looks like you 're gon na have a nice scar up there Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug cover it up for ya
That 's not bad I think you got it down
Wow Mind if I take it for a spin
What 's that
Very nice
Lem me talk to Buddy set up a meeting
At that point basically that has to be it
It 's not that simple You have to be careful There 's another guy that comes along a hard-on you owe some money to A mob guy Wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation
Good-looking too Like Karen
How do I know that
I turn it on when I confront the guy
That 's what I think of you asshole Nothing
How about this
Wait How about this
Like this
I 'm looking at you
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off I go after him The fuck you think I do
What happened The pressure got to you
With what Wiseguy money
One of mine
If you 'd like to tell me yeah
No I do n't Though I have to say I 'm curious
Yeah Kinda Anyway once I have the authentic sounds of speech the rhythms man the patois I can actually begin to think the way those guys do get inside their heads
It 's more like your attitude Your tone your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves in your opinions your indifference to conventional views
A few weeks before shooting I went back to Bensonhurst just to listen to you guys See I 'm Italian but I grew up in Tarzana So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech
Martin It was a beautiful role All I had to do was find the character 's center the stem I 'd used to wind him up and he 'd play man he 'd play
Yeah That was a good party
But you wo n't know where I am I do n't even know where I 'll be
You take all my money but you 're borrowing part of it
It 's all mine
How By taking my money
It was Fay was n't it told you about the money She tell you my whole life history for Christ 's sake
How 'd you know I was here
Who told you that
I 'm up twelve grand today
You do n't open an account Leo you put it in a safe deposit box Dip in whenever you want
You 're here a while what 's wrong with a bank
I would n't think you 're that dumb leave over three hundred grand in the closet underneath the extra blanket but I guess you are
Mr Barboni is a good customer Works for Jimmy Capp
We call you a taxi
You see a black leather jacket fingertip length like the one Pacino wore in Serpico You do n't you owe me three seventy-nine
Could n't find my toothbrush
Go get your stuff
I was scared then not now How long you want me to be scared
You bet
Oh shit I 'm sorry I thought that was I 'm so sorry
Guy 's got a fucking pink toilet for Christ 's sake
I 'll go I 'll go
I do n't know
It 's not Dave It 's a movie
You sure
Harry what 're you doing You 're supposed to be in the hospital
Why not
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway
Harry My God
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie play a hard-on But I could n't see myself in ones like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby They do n't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute 
You do n't mean a movie star More like a character actor
No I do n't mean that I just meant in general
I think you could be an actor I know you 're acting sometimes but you do n't show it
Yeah There 's a girl in it now
That 's a different story I 'm still working on that one you know getting the visual fabric just right Although I 've added to it
How 'bout Get Shorty Except that is n't a movie That 's real life
For starters Marty was n't Martin back then
You do n't like Martin much do you
Not unlike the way Nicki met him Except it was a wrap party Why
Definitely not Martin Movie stars never pick up the check They have no idea what things cost Most of them do n't know their zip code and a lot do n't even know their own phone number
That was Martin He wants to have lunch tomorrow That is if you can make it
A locker at the airport Jesus Christ Harry Tell me you 're not really that stupid
Well actually Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr Lovejoy
This thing 's actually accurate I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset
And you think the movie business is any different
Yesterday you were a loan shark
I want to know
What do you get out of it
I do n't want to act in it I want to produce it with Harry Especially if I help him get Martin
You and Harry 'll make a great team I 'm gon na make a deal with him
Then you 've read it
I think it 's not horrible
I already read it Harry left a copy at the house
I just caught the end
Yeah Right Listen Touch of Evil 's playing near my hotel You wan na go check it out Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican
Well I got ta have a talk with Leo my runaway dry cleaner
Tell you what I 'll stop by Harry 's office and pick up a copy for you
Harry told me Martin loves it he flipped
That why Harry came over last night See if you could help him get Martin in his movie
You read Harry 's new one He says it 's the best thing he 's ever read
How come you stopped making movies with Harry
Cotton
Man can you scream
For any movie
Yeah When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished when you give us all that look Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence Not even in Mildred Pierce  which by the way was a better book than a movie  did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look
Like in Bride of the Mutant when you played the whole end with that torn top
Ripped nylons work Makes the shot more real
Rough day on the set
No no you left the patio door open You got ta stop doin that all the nice things you got around here
I wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like I did last night
Hey Karen How ya doin
A couple days ago by people from the airliner come to see his wife tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement the amount based on what he would 've earned operating the dry cleaner 's the rest of his life Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys so they were giving him about ten years
A hundred and fifty-six Some 'll charge you more n that go as high as six for five on a short-term loan So three a week 's not too bad
That 's right Three percent
I know what a vig is
What if it was
You broke in
Hey Chil I think you 're fulla shit
How you gon na do that You do n't know shit about making movies
What 're you talking about You wan na be a movie star
Whatta you doing out there
He already knew it
All I know is he came by the barber shop all fuckin undone wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas I told him I do n't know I still do n't
No you just broke his fuckin nose instead
I hate to say I told you but I did I told you do n't start nothing with him that time
I told you not to 
That 's the dumbest thing I ever heard Where do you sleep
Do n't worry about it I wo n't say any more than I have to if that
Tomorrow I see on the TV weather it 's gon na be nice and warm You wo n't need the coat
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat
Momo could buy it I could run it for him Show some Cagney films
Yeah the guy owes Momo a few G 's
What she did not say was I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin seasick All she cared about was that look All she remembered was that look And why do we remember things in movies Because we can see them
So Mildred says to the cashier I saw the new Streisand picture 'God I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford 's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other but knew they could n't be together That look was so romantic
Hm
Yeah What three words Harry
What 'emotion Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick
Get down here I wan na talk to you Come on right now She 's gon na talk to Martin
Yeah but whose point of view
He said if Martin 's interested I could get a half a million for it easy But do n't worry Harry I 'm still giving you until Friday
No But now that you mention it I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day who just happened to get his hands on the script
Murray 's dead
You seem to feel fine about it
What he was was a hack could n't get a job writing for anybody but you I 'm being honest He was a lousy writer but he was a good husband I just did n't know it until too late
I miss Murray Harry
What a spectacular view
Well are n't you gon na offer me whatever it is you taste like
Hello Doris

He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand no strings I write any kind of agreement I want
Oh yeah sure

Maybe you did n't hear me
How did you get in the house
Harry 
Harry are you going down or you want me to
I do n't have a dog
When I came upstairs you stayed to finish your drink I told you to turn off the TV when you were through Come to think of it I also told you you could sleep in the maid 's room

You 'd think on a ship this size there 'd be something left to eat
The turbine blew
When they find out what it 's carrying they may not be so interested in what 's legal
I do n't know Tuesday
You find anything that even looks like a compressor I do n't care what grab it
I need lag bolts especially one inch standard And sheet metal Preferably steel about a sixteenth of an inch Aluminium even tin 'll do
Let 's not be too hasty
Where 's his boat then Where 's his crew He ai n't gon na be out here by himself that 's for damn sure
Yeah but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gon na dream about
What 's so great about Sweden
One minute I 'm minding my own business the next thing I know the whole place is burning up An oxygen tank must 've blown on the welder Started an oil fire
Damn mind of it 's own
Fucker
Are you crazy Do you realize we got ourselves a ship We own a ship Dodge
That 's what it says
Sixty pounds
Nah Everything was cool It 's just one of those things
I do n't care what ai n't nobody just gon na let us walk away with a ship that size
Hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back
Looks like Epps gon na get some tonight
Hear that Dodge Epps do n't think it 's a problem
Get up
Dodge Dodge
What say Epps You up for some roasted albatross
Did you
Try Wednesday
Other than the obvious there 's nothing wrong with him that I can see not on the outside
I do n't know what else you 'd call it He 's breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out He 's totally unresponsive to pain What happened up there
I 'm no doctor But I 'd say he 's in a coma
Smokes
Pretty handy with that scatter gun Epps You raised on a farm
One guy is n't gon na be so stupid

What other choices have we got
This 's gon na hurt a little
Last thing we want is extra partners
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either
Ready
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow
Somebody 's probably looking for her as we speak
Probably slipped her moorings got tangled up in a current
You think that 's funny

It just occurred to me I do n't know your first name All this time and I do n't know it
What is your first name
One more
Where from
Do n't fall asleep
You 're late
Tomorrow we 'll see if we ca n't find some line and tackle Use some of those bodies below decks for bait
We 'll stand the watch on deck tonight You 're up first
I do n't figure there 's much I want money ca n't buy
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants
What the hell happened
Yeah
Conveniently enough for you
I did n't touch the fucking radio
What the fuck
What
Take it easy willya What about the radio
The radio
I think you know
Just what the hell do you think you 're doing
There 's no way we 're gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here Besides it 'll be safer where it is
What do you propose
I guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth
How do you mean
If they knew what they were carrying
Not me
I think you better see this for yourself
You better get down here quick skipper I 'm on C deck Cabin 400
Dodge to Murphy
Do what you need to do Just do it fast
Ca n't you use something else
That 'd be my guess
Damn barbaric is what it is
Bodies 're too fresh
If he 's reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal If not We 'll have to re-consider our options
What if that fucker finds it before we 're ready to go
And what do you propose That we knock this guy off
Not in the eyes of the law
If somebody 's aboard her already she ai n't ours She 's theirs
Sounds like the hull
Dreamin 's all any of you 're gon na be doing if we do n't get this boat running
I 'm buyin me a nice outrigger Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget
Yeah yeah I 'm on it
You got ta be kidding What the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks
Then we 're rich We 're damn filthy stinking rich
So what 're we gon na do That 's the big question right
Or somebody stopped them
Did n't happen yesterday I 'll tell you that Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat
What you think there 's something funny about it
She take a radio
Man it gives me the creeps We got no business towing a ship that size anyway I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway
What do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened Ca n't do it skipper
Three four days
I got ta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor
It 's a full 2500 horses down We could n't drag that boat down hill on ice with it
I 'm telling you you do n't want to be running that fan like it is
Hard to say
The right way and the wrong way
Like I always say
Metal 's crystallized Got ta replace the whole deal
Turbine rotor 's shot
Hard to say I got ta get in there and have a look At least a couple days Depending
The number one turbine 's pretty well trashed Number two runs but it 's way underpowered
What is it
Sounds reasonable
The damn thing 's been floating around for God knows how long and it has n't hit anything yet So we take it easy A little of the old push pull
It 's a risk I 'm willing to take
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage The fittings alone could go for a few million
Smugglers maybe
Are you kidding me Jealous Epps Gim me a break
I did n't sign up to go home empty handed And I sure ai n't gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this
Nothing Let 's get outa here
Yeah Fine I just thought I heard something is all
Better than starving to death
I feel fine
Lights
No
Because of the gold
You 're a pal
Maybe six feet Lanky I did n't get a good look He was far away But I saw him I saw him as sure as you 're standing there
Hell yeah I like it cold Colder the better
Hell yeah
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold
Then why did n't they take it
You mean before she sank
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass
Could be a fishing boat
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that
Morning everybody
What 's slow
I do n't give a damn about the gold
It 's a trap There was no way we were gon na get away with that gold Nobody ever does It 's just the bait This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out
It 's the ship The ship 's making you think this way
Murphy do n't you see what 's happening
And now you 're gon na kill me is that it
So you killed them
You killed them
We 're in an island chain It 's only a matter of time before we hit another one
We hit land
It 's not the weather I 'm worried about The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat
Hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water
They went crazy
Over the gold
What do you think
What do we do with him
Epps You there
Nope
Epps over
Just lucky I guess
I do n't know
She said the ship was evil That we had to leave right away That if we did n't we might never leave
That much I think we 've already established
Victims of what
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks
Showing you what
I do n't know what else you 'd call her One second she was there the next she was gone
No Someone else A girl I 'm not sure she was real
When you found me yesterday at the pool I 'd seen something Someone
Are we smart enough to avoid that
The what
What do you think happened on this boat
Could n't sleep
Hey
It 's not gon na hold us
It 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it
The page 's missing Then their SOS was real
Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision Distress calls have been made
The same day she supposedly went down
The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill
Smashed it up pretty bad
What
Only something must 've gone wrong
You 're saying they mutinied for the gold
They 're dead in the water that morning Four hours later the captain 's relieved of his command And that evening they issue a general SOS
Same Any luck
I 'll call us in Dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up Keep an eye on him
I do n't know No Not Greer Somebody
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio
You just shoot at something
Murphy to Epps
Got your light
No cowboy shit up there understand
Guess that 'd be me Again
So we find this guy and make a deal with him
You sure it was n't me
Are you sure
What What the hell 're you talking about
What guy
Who
Take it easy you 'll live longer
Why not call for help
Maybe they did n't want it back Maybe the whole fat deal was insured
You 're more practical than superstitious
You think she 's sailing without a crew
So what did happen
Nope
Well suppose she got a little further north than she should have Got stuck in the ice The passengers and crew evacuated She froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid They write it off Fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens The ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her
She was sailing up north right
What 'd you find up there
Coffee
The law 's on our side If they want to challenge it let them try
Go on
Candy
Nobody 's going anywhere with that gold now Anybody tries to board we 'll know about it You can do what you want Greer But neither of us is gon na risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that
You think whoever did this is reasonable
Leave it
Does n't look like it much matters
Ca n't find the shotgun
He took the shotgun and a light
We 're still drifting
A what
Must be a little too the truth eh Dodge
Gettin a little hot under the collar I 'd say
We ai n't exactly in what you 'd call your high traffic neighborhood either
We 're not gon na be able to pump it
We heard you scream Any idea what you might 've seen
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins
You 've been out for about a day
You do n't remember
Lost my sea legs
Drink up then
Maybe
And look what happened
Could n't have happened much more than a month ago
We 'll have to take it easy then I do n't think we 'll find much aboard the ship but it 's probably worth looking around
Would you hold on just a minute here please Look there 's no reason to panic now Epps saw somebody Fine It 's a big boat Chances 're real good he does n't even know about the gold If we stay cool nobody 'll be the wiser The gold stays where it is til we 're ready to go Like I said it 'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here
Supposing he wants to get bad with us
I do n't know
Greer
Fifty million four ways That 's twelve million and change a piece What you gon na do with your share skipper
We could call for help
Dodge you got ta get on those repairs
It 's worth the effort Believe me Besides we 're gon na need her to prove the salvage
We leave it where it is Stick to the plan
Not for fifty million An ocean liner maybe But fifty million in gold they come looking for
Ho baby
How much you figure that 's worth skipper
You 're up late
Yeah
So we cut her loose and wait it out A little weather could n't be anything she has n't seen before
We 've done it before
Whatever the reason she 's adrift and abandoned We 've got every right to salvage her
Murphy goddamit
How 's that
Steer to one eight five Let 's check her out
Looks like it 's adrift
Alright I 'll be right up
There 's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west
Red sky in morning sailor take warning
Better than making hamburger for Mickey D
I must be in the wrong business
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia
Let the buyer beware
The number nine on the starboard side 's half flooded Epps says it 's a slow leak just under the waterline about twenty gallons an hour They must 've pumped it before we left Sitka
Greer to Murphy
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me Tarzan
I heard you But I 'm choosing to ignore you Epps let 's go
As I said what seems to be the trouble
What seems to be the trouble ladies
You 're kidding right
Fifteen at the most
You pump it out and re-seam the hull she 'll be good as new
You got a leak in the number nine compartment
Better late than never
JUST DO IT
What 's wrong with you Tell him I 'm not here
What do you mean on his way up
I-I 'm not sure yeah maybe
I was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry I 'll be completely out of her life in a few days
About what
Pumpkin are you in there
What
It 's nothing it 's just some hormonal thing do n't worry about it
Pumpkin What 's wrong
Well Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience but she thinks she can convince them
Are you still looking for a job
I have some good news for you Pumpkin
I made spaghetti Do you want some
God how horrifying
Not the Maxine
YES
Who
How should I know
Who
Look at me I 'm not even listening to a word you 're saying
Look I told you I 'm not going to college
Will you get off my back for once
Nope What are you making pancakes
I ca n't believe this I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me
Please tell me it is n't that teenager
It 's just that I feel like it 's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out
I uh I feel that I need to uh there 's something I feel I have to say I uh I 've never said this to anyone before believe me I 've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I would n't have to do this but I uh
We 're almost done Hi Yeah no it 's excluded They 've already paid the earnest money well let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through Right great sounds good
Seymour Hello What are you doing here
Dana Hi Uh Dana this is Enid
Really I never really cared for those Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one
I 'm so excited to see this film Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director Did you see his last film The Flower That Drank The Moon It was simply glorious
Hey it 's nearly nine already we 're gon na have to leave now if we 're going to make that movie
Do n't be silly anyone can dance Here just follow me watch my feet
Oh I just love this song Is n't it great Does n't it make you want to dance C'mon
Yeah where is this Bosnia
Oh I love to cook I guess most women would n't invite a man over on the first date but I believe you should trust your instincts When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so I do n't know harmless Ready for ice cream
I 'm sorry Enid you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you I had to give it to someone else But I 'm sure next year I can
Well they 're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition but do n't worry I 'm sure I 'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall
Oh my goodness well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I 'm going to do everything I can to help you
Did n't Principal Jaffee call you
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper it 's absolutely
Enid I 'm so sorry about what happened
I
I dunno Would I have to take classes and stuff
wow
Hmm
I 'm not really sure working I guess
Uh-oh
I 'm not sure I mean I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking
It 's complicated I guess I 'm trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now it 's hidden or something
Well no it 's more like a found art object
Well I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook 's Chicken used to be called Coon 's Chicken and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture
I see interesting
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject
Who is this Enid
And what can you tell us about this
It 's not optional
Well lose it And why are n't you pushing the large sizes Did n't you get training about upsizing
What the hell is wrong with you
Look we do n't pay you to be a movie critic just do your job
Look that 's the policy if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater
What are you doing You do n't ever criticize the feature
I 'm gon na let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself that way I can evaluate your performance while it 's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds
Hey Josh
Just take my word for it if she ever finds out about this I 'll never hear the end of it
Because if you do I 'll kill you
I do n't think we should Look you have to totally promise me you wo n't tell Becky about this
I could n't sleep I should get going I feel really weird
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars It 's so typical Either they 're into cars or guns or sports or guitars it 's so obvious
Why do you have that stupid poster
It 's just my stupid way of getting attention God I practically love you Josh
That 's just the way I am
You 've never once said anything even remotely nice to me
Then why do you hate me so much
Yeah right well why not What 's so wrong with me
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms
Why
I guess
Can I come in
Yeah well hi
Hi
You need counseling
No
Forget it
Jesus look at this guy
In answer to your question I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form
No I 'm serious Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell
SHH He 's back there I can see his hair bobbing up and down
This is the ultimate It 's like the Taj Mahal of bad fake 50 's diners
It 's just an excuse for us to spend time with you
No
Who Doug He spends more time here than I do
Look can we talk in a minute I 'm almost done
I 'm afraid I do n't understand I simply wish to know
What can you tell me young man about the various flavors of frozen yogurt
Well hello there young employee of the Sidewinder
Wow finally

You 're lucky then you ca n't see the veins on that guy 's biceps
Hi

Of course it 's a good idea it 's our plan
Please let me come with you Please please please
I 'm sorry about the other day I do n't know what 's wrong with me I really do want to move in with you
Hello
You 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy
Because you 'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it
Well what am I supposed to say I ca n't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere
I said great
Great
I do n't know God do n't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes
Nothing
He came into work
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood
It 's a totally normal average neighborhood
Yeah well you said you were busy look I 'd better get going I 'll call you tomorrow
Just some people from work
Actually I 'm just about to go out with some friends
How repulsive
What happened to Seymour
Hello
Oh yeah maybe Seymour 's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls so I can hear how bad it went
What thing
You 're insane
I ca n't imagine spending money on towels
Why do you care about this kind of stuff
I ca n't afford stuff like this right now
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster Let 's just try and keep everything the way it is
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that
God you 're really obsessed
Go ahead
Yeah I guess call me
I ca n't it 's Seymour 's birthday Shit What time is it I have to go to the store I was going to make him a cake
Yeah thanks
Do n't worry
Oh yeah right like I 'm gon na let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus
Oh my god I remember this hat this was during your little old lady phase
This is it I ca n't believe you 're selling some of this stuff
What are you talking about What kind of loser gets fired after one day
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him
Seventh you wanted to move out right then
Anyway now we can start looking for the apartment Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment
When are you finally going to get your diploma
Are you kidding It 's a dream job I ca n't believe you got a job like that without even trying God I wish that was my job
maybe we should be lesbos
That 's not true I just hate all these obnoxious extroverted pseudo bohemian losers Sometimes I think I act so weird because I 'm crazy from sexual frustration
Yeah right Believe me at this point I 'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me
He 's like the biggest idiot of all time
Which one
Or maybe did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos Maybe that 's why we spend so much time together
I wonder if I hang around with you because you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly
God I ca n't believe you went to Anthony 's without me
Like what
Yeah well So when are you going to get your job
No it does n't You 'll see you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos
He 's a total asshole He does n't even need that wheelchair he 's just totally lazy
I do n't know Some people are okay but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody
He does that every single day
You cunt
No way when
Where
Where did you get that
Wait
Aw c'mon this is a fun party
If I promise you there 's really a party with a lot of guys do you promise you 'll go
It 's a surprise
I know a party we could go to
Let 's get out of here this place makes me sick
How about this
This morning at Seymour 's garage sale
Hey you have to see my new good luck charm
Everybody 's too stupid
It 's not like I 'm some modern Punk dickhead It 's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it
It 'll only take a second
Should we leave a note
I 'll bet he never jerks off
JOSH
I wonder if he 's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or
As always
Hassle
Where are we going
It 's always closed
Fuck you bitch
What How long have you been standing there
Just promise you 'll do it
That 's who people want to rent to It 's a known fact that it 's way easier to get a job and everything if you 're rich All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it 's no big deal it 'll be fun
I 've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we 're like these totally rich yuppies
Funky
We 're not sure yet that 's why we 're looking
Not really
That guy is many things but he definitely is n't cool This one would be okay but there 's no kitchen
He should totally just kill himself Hey here 's one Oh wait you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats
What about the striking redhead in the yellow dress
He was so excited when you bought that record you 're a saint God these apartments are super expensive
That was truly pathetic
I think it 's cute look at his little weasel teeth
Ew look at this
What should we do What if he recognizes us
The W.C Fields Fan Club Newsletter Oh my God The National Psoriasis Foundation
He wo n't see us we 'll just stalk him from a distance
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time
He does n't even look that bummed out really
He 's insane
Are you sure
Do you think he knows
What 's he doing now
What 's going on now What 's he doing
It 's obviously him
Is he wearing a green cardigan
SHUT UP
I want to make love to him
Look maybe that 's him
I know look at the way he drives he 's like an old man
Shh it 's his answering machine We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for dwarf
Why do I always have to do it
Oh yeah
Which loser
Fuck you
What are you talking about who
I want to do him
I can never keep them all straight was she the super-bitch
I remember every minute of that party
What a little hosebag
I 've been looking all over for this
Hey why do you have this
What is this
So what should we do
Does Oomie really like this show
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead
God that 's so pathetic I bet she did n't even notice him
Gross
You can have that one
Check out the Personals maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us
I know and instead of dessert it says Mindbenders
You loser
Can we call you Weird Al
I feel as though I 've stepped into a time warp
God it 's so totally pathetic
Hey look at this
Maybe they 're slowly poisoning us or they 're planning to brainwash us and
Maybe there 's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us
You know sacrifice virgins and stuff
In fact never
We should follow them
I know it has n't really hit me yet
Yeah I just picked the one that sounded the easiest
Soon I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes
Just look at them
Look at these people behind you I 'm totally convinced they 're Satanists
God think about that that 's actually totally depressing
God just think we 'll never see Dennis again
How perfect
I know she needs to die immediately
Forget it
Uh oh do n't turn around
Unless they 're in your Summer school class
This is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again
You loser
Why
What
It 's totally sickening Let 's see if they gave me the right diploma
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up
See that 's exactly the kind of thing we 're trying to avoid
What are you going to be when you grow up Todd
Really Both of you Why not
Oh hey Enid So we finally made it
I love this place it 's so you know funky
My acting workshop is across the street from here I 'm just on my break
Oh my god what are you guys doing here
Oh yeah that 'll definitely happen
Nothing
Yeah we graduated high school how totally amazing
Listen young lady I know you do n't like me I do n't really care whether you do or not but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do
I want to know what you think you 're doing staying out all night and worrying your father to death
May I ask what you 're doing
It 's really quite something to see you all grown up like this Enid I 'd love to hear about what you 're doing I ca n't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out What are you studying You were always such a smart little girl
Do n't mind me I 'll just be in my room
I 'm thinkin maybe I could let it go
You still interested in that
Who does
Do you have any other old records besides these
Perhaps the Jam-in-ator appeals to you Absolutely no practice necessary You shread like a giant Just press a button
How much is this
A what
Go die asshole
That tape sucked by the way
ELLIS Yeah yeah yeah Do you have my money
ELLIS If you really want to fuck up the system you should go to business school that 's what I 'm gon na do get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside
ELLIS Punk rock is over
ELLIS Did n't they tell you
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago There are no buses on this street
are you waiting for a bus
Hi what 's your name
Hey where are you going
Fuck you you stupid redneck hick
I did too
Did you bring that tape
You 're late asshole
God fuck you
Well why do I care about that
You 're crazy it should be like two dollars
What
I can treat him any way I want to I 'm an adult Leave me alone
Shhh I really need to get some sleep
I was just thinking out loud I mean you 've got this whole thing with Dana I 'm not going to let you fuck that up
Yeah well me neither
No forget it
What Maybe no I dunno
God Dana 's going to kill you
I-I-I
What do you want
I dunno I
So where would we go
I do n't think I 'm in any condition to drive
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems
I guess I probably used to when I was your age
What
Yeah well I like you too
What about Joe
Yeah sure Of course
I mean of course I why would n't I want to go out with you
You 're a beautiful young girl I ca n't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity
I hate sports
I 'm just being realistic
If you expect the worst you 're never disappointed
God she 's going to kill me this bottle is half-empty
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping She said it did n't go with her stuff so she gave it to me she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs
I could never move I 've got too much stuff
FUCK DANA I 'm sick of Dana
What about this
Do you have anything to drink
Look I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I 'll leave you alone
Can you at least let me in
I had to see you
Nothing Do n't worry I wo n't bother you any more
I do n't think you understand how I really feel about you Seymour
In whatever way you think I mean
So do you like me Seymour
Does that mean you do n't like me
You must have done something to make her think you like me
What does she mean by that somebody like me
What 's her problem anyway Did she actually tell you you could n't see me
So that 's it You do n't ever want to see me again
And you like them
It 's just that well you know Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I do n't want to give her the wrong idea you know
I I wish I could Enid but I really ca n't right now I it 's just that I
I better not
I I do n't know I do n't really think I should
Maybe I dunno He wants to be of course I 'm weighing several offers at the present time
I dunno okay I guess I fucked that guy Josh finally
Are n't you even going to ask me how I 'm doing
What are you trying to get rid of me
Sounds good
So what kind of stuff do you guys do together Is she into old records and stuff
Yeah I 'll bet So how 's it going with what's-her-name Dana
No actually Joe told me you were here so how come you never call me anymore
Where have you been I 've been looking all over for you I 've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you
Boo
What are you going to like have sex with her on your first date
What You 're kidding me
So what happened
Hi it 's me
Well uh I 'm an expert-about stuff like this she was totally for real
Seymour I promise you that was n't a joke you have to call her back
That did n't sound like a joke to me what did you write a personal ad or something
Wow What was that all about
Are n't you going to get that
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them
Never mind it 's way too complicated Did you have problems like this when you were my age where you 're totally confused all the time
Oh wait you met him remember that guy Josh I 'm like practically obsessed with him but I ca n't do anything about it because Becky would freak out
Actually I 've got a total crush on this one guy right now but it 's a really fucked-up situation
I know It 's not like it makes all your problems go away
Never
I mean I 'm eighteen years old and I 've never even had a real steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks
Yeah well you 're not the only one Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems It seems like only stupid people have good relationships
What like a girdle
What is that
Are you okay
No Doofus blow it out
You can open your eyes now
I dunno they 're very sensitive at work about all this stuff Maybe it would be better if you
What Why
No in a lot of ways things are better now I dunno it 's complicated Everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something
I make enough money to eat and buy old records what more do I want
Hey I get good benefits a good early retirement plan nobody ever bothers me
Nothing so glamorous actually I 'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters
For nineteen years
Actually I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook 's phenomenon when I was about your age I 've kind of lost interest since I 've been working for them
Four-piece Cook 's special deep fried with side n slaw it 's OUT RAY-GEOUS
What are you a klansman or something
What the fuck Seymour What is this
If you do n't mind my asking why do you care so much if I get a date or not
Yet
I 'm not sure I have anything to drink there might be some
I 'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar At least you 're an interesting person at least you 're not exactly like everybody else
Yeah well I ca n't relate to humanity either but I do n't think it 's totally hopeless
It 's not hopeless
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is n't a total idiot that 's all
Jesus
What did you tell that girl
Wait a minute Hang on Jesus I got ta think of something to talk to her about No No
Yes that would certainly do
What are we in slow motion here What are ya hypnotized Have some more kids why do n't you For Christ 's sake would you move
This bar 's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from
So why did you bring this along
Relax Seymour relax

Look at this Lollipop Lolitas is n't child pornography totally illegal
Shh
Fine I 'll go by myself then
PLEASE We have to
We 'll just go in for one minute it 'll be a riot
Please Seymour Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we ca n't get any boys to take us Please
Oh my god We have to go in here
Josh He 's nobody 's boyfriend He 's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture
Let 's just say music that way you only use up one Wait we have to go in here for a second
Yeah yeah yeah Just tell me your five main interests in order of importance
We need to narrow this down somehow we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests
Every guy has a type
C'mon Seymour I 'm trying to collect data here Do n't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl
Okay what about this one Are you into girls with big tits
But putting that aside for now would you go out with her
What about her Would you go out with her
Mark my words by the end of this summer you 'll be up to your neck in pussy
I mean it You leave everything to me I 'm going to be your own personal dating service
I 'm totally serious
No really I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds
I 'm talking to you I 'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute
No you 're not You 're a cool guy Seymour
Oh come on What are you talking about
God look at this poster I ca n't believe this room You 're the luckiest guy in the world I 'd kill to have stuff like this
Wow This is like my dream room Are these all records
Really Can I see it
You 're right about that So this is your record collection
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks
NO
Watch my stuff
Do you want to see it I can run upstairs and get it
The Skip James record Yeah that 's a masterpiece There are no other records like that I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection It 's one of maybe five known copies
So you really liked it Yeah there 's some really rare performances You liked that Memphis Minnie huh
Okay
How much is it
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about 500 if you have the original 78 She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived and a great singer and songwriter as well I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue
Is this one any good
Sure I guess
Sure Wait maybe not 78s but I can play regular records
I do n't have anything after about 1935 I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection but it 's not really for sale I do n't really collect foreign
Indian records
Right
Do n't worry about it He 's not gettin any and neither are you
They 're Seymour 's
No problem
Maybe she 's got another boyfriend
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records She could at least have the decency to call me back
Yeah I 'm really really happy Really having a good time
Call me sometime
Did you remember to pay the phone bill
I agree
So Josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us
Please Josh
Right exactly
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood because of tea parties in the olden days but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this like
It 's a found object that 's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art
It 's a tampon in a teacup
Is n't this a wonderful piece class This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier
Talk to us about it
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class Who is responsible for this
Did n't she ever tell you about that God she really is pathological
On that pathetic fake blind date
Look what do you expect Considering how we met you
Yeah she thinks you 're a dork
That slut
Why would n't she tell me There 's no way She could never keep that to herself you 're crazy
What Is she having some secret affair with Josh
Why What did she tell you
Josh Why would she be with Josh
I do n't know where is she then
Are you sure she was n't there Maybe she was just hiding from you
What the fuck is she doing She was supposed to be here three hours ago
She 's not at home
Do you have a check for me
Seymour
Thank you doctor
It does n't pay very much but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months Do you think that 's too soon I 'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage
Well mostly archival research cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues It 's really I ca n't believe it
I have to admit things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit
at last you 're right we do you are the problem in Tsavo
now you 're telling me my beliefs I do n't think so
The next time will be as this time The Devil has come to Tsavo
Morning friend glorious day
He 'll replace you too that 's all you really care about
You think you matter Beaumont is on that train he matters
oh sing a different song Abdullah there 's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is
There is no reason for fear
Let me see the sick
You were contracted to work
How we do n't know where they are
I think it 's been a pleasure
Most certainly Absolutely Yes
I am a man of peace
You do n't know all that has happened here the Devil has come to Tsavo
not a time for modesty Bob
Very well the job 's still yours I 'll go But if I have to return you 're finished And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation Am I not fair Told you you 'd hate me
I 'm going to try and locate Redbeard I assume you 've heard of him
Let me explain about time you 've been here three months and already two months behind And the Germans and the French are gearing up And I do n't care about you and I do n't care about the thirty dead I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule I 'll get my knighthood and I want it Professional hunters may be the answer
I made a mistake hiring you you 're simply not up to the job
In point of fact it did n't But I 'm convinced the theory is sound
I did n't conceive of it for the lions I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger
Genius the beast will enter tripping the wire the door will slide down trapping him you safe behind the bars will have him at your mercy and will shoot him
I 'm calling it my contraption we 're going to surround it with a boma a fence to you and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door
What have they done besides kill Starling How many have they killed
what 's the surprise in that this is Africa
Well I need to speak to him
Awhile back he ordered some bibles I 've brought them Is he here
I do need to see Starling
Truthfully There has been the occasional odd hiccup but then as you so wisely told me I 'd never built in Africa
Do n't they though
How could it be I hate Africa
You wo n't have the chance Any further words of encouragement Then I 've a train to catch
I 've got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I 'd be with her when the baby comes
But I have in India every country presents problems
I 'm sure you 've examined my record So you know I 've never yet been late on a bridge
Games Look at me closely Patterson I am a monster My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me such as yourself One mistake and I promise you this I 'll make you hate me
John Henry Patterson come in I 'm Robert Beaumont Firm I like that tells me a lot about you now why do n't you tell me about me To get you started many people find me handsome with a wonderful smile I 'm sure you agree Winning personality heaps of charm
You do n't enjoy killing do you
Karim will have to show me where it happened And of course I 'll need the donkey With any luck I 'll sort it out tonight
Who else would hire me Beat you to it did n't I Oh yes almost forgot brought you a little welcoming gift
This sham Ridiculous Who needs it It 's only being built to control the ivory trade make men richer
please you need n't be so graphic
Well he got away did n't he Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them donkey took the brunt of it then suddenly the lion ran off
Nigel and I do n't like each other much
I 'm David Hawthorne this is my hospital And my advice to you is do n't get sick in front of it That was meant to be charming sorry I seem to have lost the knack
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived
Silliest thing I ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that
That 's a terrible idea
Go now Such a gentleman
What if there are complications
well it 's just other men do n't abandon their wives at such a time
It was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments
We 're not much good at goodbyes Helena
COOLIE I assure you we came close many times
COOLIE I would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving
COOLIE That is correct Nothing
COOLIE We have hunted since childhood
We all worked together Worthy deeds were accomplished I liked the labor My mother insisted on piano lessons broke the dear woman 's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands I like the blood is that strange
What a good week
far end of camp man wandering alone at night Hawthorne 's examining the body now There 's even less of him than of Singh
That 's what the books say
I 'll try but this feels so different that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh 's size
John it will not be easy
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there
Possibly
How lucky we are
With much more on the way John we could have had this chat on flatter ground
one shot
Since you 'd only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions
John I know this is n't the time to ask but
you 'll have to deal with it Nigel
Shhh
Well why not You seem so calm and experienced Why not indeed
I 've never been all that adventurous I would n't be in the way
I do n't suppose I could watch
You said of course you 'd need the donkey Why of course
I could n't believe it when you said sort it out As if it were the most normal thing in the world Ho-hum what lovely tea I think I 'll bag a killer beast this evening nothing much else going on anyway
And anxious to get started What is this mostly malaria
I 've got medical supplies to deliver Come along to the hospital when you 're done
Does he speak English
Have you got that in writing
Beaumont says it 's to end slavery
Almost three hours But I 've been getting ready all my life
Just that they fart through their mouths Must make kissing something of a gamble
The females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they would n't survive because the males eat the young
That I know Robert seems dreadful but when you truly get to know the man well he 's much worse And I 'm one of his defenders Forget him for now it 's your first ride to Tsavo I think you 'll find it breathtaking
Many thanks You 're Patterson yes Nigel Starling I 'll be assisting you at Tsavo but surely Beaumont must have told you that
Understood you realize now you could never have done it without me
The most of any lions a hundred Probably more Johnny
Because I think they 're after you
Good luck
It 's certainly the best chance they 've had to kill you
I ca n't control mine I 'd be lost without the shame factor driving me
Yes And I 'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever Can you control your fear
Not for me I 'm too bulky and it 's your idea you go up there Take the others to the water tower for the night
Do n't they have to be
Nobody 's seen anything like this Lions do n't have caves like this they 're doing it for pleasure
I got big
In my town when I was little there was a brute a bully who terrorized the place But he was not the problem He had a brother who was worse than he But the brother was not the problem One or the other of them was usually in jail The problem came when they were both free togther The two became different from either alone Alone they were only brutes Together they became lethal together they killed
It would have been a beautiful bridge John I never noticed before occupied with other business I suppose never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I 've had the time today nothing else on and this it 's graceful and the placement could n't be prettier and
But of course yours worked
It 's all right Stay ready They know it 's there
Only in life
Think about something else
Has it ever done that before
You 'd never force the lion to me and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck Around there 's a clearing you 'll know it from the anthills get there and hide and listen to the sounds I 'll make the lion come directly to you
Samuel says you killed a lion
The best way to ensure the kill when you 're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter Have you ever led trackers
Have you got it
That 's very considerate
Somehow I guessed
Actually no
We need to talk
Got me out of trouble
I did n't have a chance to thank you
Afraid of lions
Where is it
He has children
Three years I 've worked for the railroad Now I do n't know why It seemed a good idea once
Thank you Why does he need you by him
You 've known him long
You like him do n't you
Soon
I do actually very much
I expect so it 's from my wife
Thank you Samuel
Look out Samuel here it comes
Fine Get started And a strict curfew no one allowed out at night Send half your men to the bridge the rest with these two And I 'm sorry for my tone earlier But I repeat there is no reason for fear I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge
You do n't know what Tsavo means do you It means slaughter
You they can not believe you 're still here
Clearly you do n't agree about building the railroad
This is more difficult
Get on They detest each other Obviously the Africans hate the Indians But the Indians also hate the other Indians Some of them worship cows while others eat them
Thank you The truth is this you have to work at it constantly
Because they are here Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world Come John to the bridge
Hold your son high
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity Was that worth all the lives Too soon to tell
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas You
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers and by the time we 're done I promise you the odor of blood will be irresistible
Gentlemen there 's no sickness smell at all here and little blood When we leave close the gate securely do n't open it til morning and keep your fires high Any questions ask them now You two will sleep beautifully in your tents And stay there
Did you ever see a lion that size
Why so many
Four should do it
I do n't believe you had a mother
I 'd rather not
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul I could never forgive what you 've done to me and my child
We do n't have a relationship
I do n't care who he is He 's not taking my baby
Everybody has a choice
If this is what the world will be like I do n't want to live in it
What do you want with my baby
Dana are n't you going to introduce me to your friend
Okay just thought I 'd check Good night Dana Sleep well Do n't let the bedbugs bite you
Do you need anything You want me to come in
Janosz
I 'm sorry Perhaps some other time
Actually I 'm not eating lunch today I have an appointment In fact I 'd better go
Thank you Janosz I 've learned a lot here but now that my baby 's a little older I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra
Oh yes I got in a little late this morning Janosz
I wo n't
Certainly
No Not that I can recall
Venkman I think he was borderline for a while there Then he crossed the border
Occasionally
Oh no
We 'll do the happiness index next I 'd like to bring Ray in on your case if it 's all right with you
What are you working on Egon
Hundreds of people Believe me I did n't imagine this
Okay that 's no problem
Did n't I do it
That 's a good-looking kid you got there Ms Barrett
Thank you Frank I 'll get the hang of this eventually
You 're also a human being Frank
Frank do you think you could give me a hand with these bags
That 's a terrible thing to say
That 's not true It was 1620
I think he likes you I think I do too
Maybe I should call Janine
So why do n't you give me a jingle in the year 2000
Why do you say things like that You 're so much better than you know
Oh Peter I did n't dump you I just had to protect myself You really were n't very good for me you know
For one night in your life do you think it 's possible for us to be completely real
I want to stop getting involved with men who are n't good for me
I have a hamper Next time ask me first okay I have more than two grades of laundry There 're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here
Janine Melnitz are you kidding Do I have a vase I brought some of your clothes Wear something intriguing I brought along some interesting possibilities
It 's Janine Melnitz from my staff She 's one of my most valuable employees
Now you get dressed and we go out I got a babysitter and everything Trust me you need it
Yes I 'm very clean Did they find anything at my apartment
I 'll put him down for you You are way too short And your belly-button sticks out You 're nothing but a burden to your poor mother
Or we could do that
For me it 's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me If we go the other way I 'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night
Be careful on that sofa it 's a butt-biter But the bed 's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired feel free In fact I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here
Bathroom 's right here let me just tidy up a few things
It was full of this awful pink ooze
Peter what about the bathtub
I 'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub You better stay here
Who could blame him Were you wearing this nightgown
You know if anyone else told me that I 'd have serious doubts But coming from you I ca n't honestly say I 'm surprised
No I just got in a couple hours ago Come on in Are we having a pajama party
I 'd like to stay but I really do n't have time to hang around here I 'll call you Later Johnny
I may be wrong but I think you 've got a little crush on this guy
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman I hate this painting I 've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage
I 'm sure you did n't come here just to talk about art
You 're really good you know
So this is what you do huh
Good luck
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug
Please do n't say that You wo n't go to prison
I wish I could stay I feel personally responsible for you being here
That 's where the buggy stopped
Brings back a lot of sweet memories does n't it There 's our old cash machine And the dry cleaners we used to go to And the old video store We really had some good times did n't we
I 'll do it
Peter this is serious I need to know if you think there 's anything unusual about him
His name is Oscar
What do you think
Well when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain that 's when I left
You never asked me and every time I brought it up you 'd get drowsy and fall asleep
He did n't ditch me We had some problems he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it
I can see that you 're still very bitter about us but in the interest of science I 'm going to give it my best shot Let 's go to work boys
You know Dana I 'm very very hurt that you did n't call me first I 'm still into all this stuff you know Have n't you ever seen my show
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
Peter do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things
A little to the left Right there That 's where it stopped
Hi Egon
Hi Ray It 's good to see you Thanks for coming
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn I ca n't be sure Peter
I received this information from an alien I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that 's where he told me about the end of the world
According to my sources the world will end on February 14 in the year 2016
Look I 've had it with you Get your stuff together get back in that clown car and get out of here This is a city matter and everything 's under control
Before you go running to the newspapers with this would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown
That 's quite a story
No that 's what I want to talk to the mayor about We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you
I 'm an old friend of the mayor 's I just want to say hello to him
Yeah you can get your hand off my chest
You 're very brave Louis Good luck
I 'm not sure this is such a good idea Do they know you 're doing this
I do n't think we should leave her alone
Tonight
Okay
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services which was a good deal for all of them because then they did n't have to withhold tax and social security which I 'm not saying is right but it 's just a story so I guess it 's all right I can finish this later if you 're tired
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them
Oh sure that sounds great
Janine do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home
That 's very practical I hate going out on New Year 's Eve too
Have you made any plans yet You know tomorrow is New Year 's Eve
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you 're already an accountant
What are you doing up here
Ghostbusters
Do n't worry We 're not moving He is
What is it honey
You pitiful miserable creatures You dare to challenge the power of darkness Do n't you realize what you are dealing with He 's Vigo You are like the buzzing of flies to him
So you see everything is in order is it not
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio People start imagining things
The Upper West Side
We got a major creep alert and we 're just going down the list Your name was first
I know
My pleasure
Well I 'd make an exception in this case if I were you

It 's a painting I 'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition It 's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo the Carpathian He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century
Pleasure to meet you I 've seen you on television
Lord Vigo the mother Dana is fine and strong I was wondering well would it be possible if I bring the baby could I have the woman
I await the word of Vigo
the sorrow
Yes the scourge
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain I sat on a throne of blood What was will be what is will be no more Now is the season of evil Find me a child that I might live again
I Vigo the scourge of Carpathia the sorrow of Moldavia command you
These boys are n't playing around
They 're the Scoleri Brothers I tried them for murder They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48 Now they want to kill me
You 've got to do something
Keep that up mister and I 'll find you in contempt
That 's it That 's all you have to say
Get on with it counselor
Yes
Do I
Okay let me rephrase that question Did n't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children
I let them handle all the little stuff I just come in on the big ones
Hey Wait Okay I 'll meet you there
This is my cousin Sherman Sherm say hello to the Ghostbusters I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out
I 'm telling you we 're all going to be in big trouble if we do n't do something fast That ghost guy came and took my friend 's baby and we got to get it back It 's just a scared little baby Sherm
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out did n't she
I got you out of those bad tax shelters
Sherman I 've done lots of favors for you
Why ca n't you just have them released You 're a doctor
Come on Sherm You 're my cousin Do this for me I 'm begging you
This is not just some money-making scheme I did n't just make up the date I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year 's Eve
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year 's Eve
Well I think it 's important for people to know that the world is in danger
No I guess I 'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in but I 'm going to tell you the truth There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding things that ca n't be explained and that most people do n't want to know about anyway That 's where we come in
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we did n't think anyone would notice
Objection Irrelevant and immaterial
Ostrov I 've been there Good party town
From where Neptune
Pretty impressive huh
So far so good
It 's working The positive GeV 's are climbing
Boys listen You 're scaring the straights Let 's save this until tomorrow okay
You know animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population
That 's it I 'll be back
Vigo the Carpathian born 1505 died 1610
You were supposed to help me with this
That 's a thousand million electron volts
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street
Yeah you would Is that for personal or professional reasons
I do n't even want to know where that is
How 've you been How 's teaching I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours huh
Egon
Do n't shoot You 'll hit Ray
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us
I ca n't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there 's no way back Sure it 's crowded it 's dirty it 's noisy And there are too many people who 'd just as soon step on your face as look at you But there 've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg We just have to mobilize it
Butt out you pencil-necked geek I 've had it with you
Nine feet ten
Six feet seven eight
No not exactly a man of the people Also known as Vigo the Cruel Vigo the Torturer Vigo the Despised and Vigo the Unholy
I 'm Egon
Hey I did n't imagine it There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy huh
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole
Why do n't we try the Giga-meter
Good idea
This one 's interesting Berlin 1939 a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground Three hundred eyewitnesses
Who was that
Late Renaissance I think Caravaggio or Brunelleschi
Rivers of the stuff
Is the line sinking
There 's definitely something going on in that studio The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red
We 've found it at every event site we 've been to lately
What 's your story Pete
My great-grandparents were Swiss I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived
I think she looks pretty good here do n't you
Vigi Vigi Vigi you have been a bad little monkey
My Fault
I do n't think they make Nikes in her size
I 'll keep to the middle of the channel We 're okay to 59th Street then we 'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job
Forget it The Vienna Boys Choir could n't get through this stuff
It looks like a giant Jello mold
Yeah sorry I missed it I guess you guys did n't know about the dress code here It 's really kind of a coat and tie place
Okay but you 're missing all the fun
Darn it I wish I 'd known you were going I 'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations
Do n't tell me let me guess All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler
What happened
Beautiful beautiful Work with me baby Just have fun with it Okay he 's playing it cool Let 's finish up and get out of here
Did you find anything at Dana 's
Well we sing to it we talk to it we say supportive nurturing things
We 're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction
'Mood slime We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it
This is what you do with your spare time
And now you 're going to eat it
Oh good you 're here Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes
Hold on Ray Half-price Have you gone crazy
I 'm Peter
Okay let 's heat 'em up
Relax We 're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet low key no profile
I love this We 're onto something really big I can smell it Ray We 're going to make some headlines with this one
What 's that
Well Holmes what do you think
Who Ray
Who Who Who
Who Just someone we know
Oh just checking something for an old friend
Uh I ca n't I 'm kind of working on something
I knew that voice sounded familiar What 's up How 's it going
Oh hiya Pete
Groovy I 've never felt better in my life
I 've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty Now I finally get here and we 're taking her out for a walk
Do n't you see It 's the slime That stuff is like pure concentrated evil
Oh yeah Anytime anytime Just go ahead and try it
Look Zeddemore it was n't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line
Yeah I guess so It was the strangest thing I knew what I was doing but I could n't stop This really terrible feeling came over me and I do n't know I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all Whew Sorry boys
Well do n't think
Are you telling me how to drive
Are you all right You coming down with something
You finished here
Now that 's one ugly dude
You got a flux and a half
And he did n't die of old age either He was poisoned stabbed shot hung stretched disemboweled drawn and quartered
Does it have any favorites
Yeah what did we do Ray The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise
Give it up Ray You 're living in the past Ghostbusters does n't exist anymore In a year these kids wo n't even remember who we are
That 's it Ray I 've had it No more parties I 'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds
I 'm ready
Miss Blue Blood Her family 's been here since the year 12
It 's okay I have my Senior Lifesaving card
If she 's naked under that toga She 's French you know
Kind of makes you wonder does n't it
And pure
It better not start yet I 'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch
Tell him about the toaster
Right and the first time someone gets mad their toaster will eat their hand
What 's the matter dear
Hey sweetheart will you CUT THAT OUT
To the bathroom where do you think
I did n't break your precious clock Roy
Roy Your clock broke
I do n't know It probably would 've been the same
I was just going to say eight You 're fantastic
Okay Just give me a second here I have to leave now but if you 've got some time I 'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me
Do you think I have it Dr Venkman
Well you 're doing great Keep it up
Incredible Five for five You 're not cheating on me here are you
Ready What is it
Is it a star
I 'm innocent Honest Dana I never touched you Not that I remember anyway
I am Zuul
I got the Twister game for later
Great Bring her too But you better hurry I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they 're almost gone I 'll make some more though
Hey it 's crazy in here You 're missing a classic party
Oh Dana it 's you
You know you should n't leave your TV on so loud when you go out That creep down the hall phoned the manager
Okay I 'll take a raincheck I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods but you know that Listen that reminds me I 'm having a party for all my clients It 's gon na be my fourth anniversary as an accountant I know you fill out your own tax return but I 'd like you to come being that you 're my next door neighbor and all
Oh no I feel great I just ordered some more vitamins I see you were exercising So was I I taped 20 Minute Workout and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout You wan na have a mineral water with me
I thought it was the drug store
Oh Dana it 's you
This is going to cost you you know Our fees are ridiculously high
Yeah along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions This one took some work
Nothing We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen
There is no Dana I am Zuul
I am Zuul I am
I want you inside me
Take me now
Do you want this body
He is the Destructor
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer
Hey Dana What is it What happened
I 'll pick you up at your place I 'll bring along the Roylance Guide we can read after we eat
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients I 'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser
I 'm checking on that I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it
Gozer he was very big in the Sumerian religion One of their gods
Well the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C by the What 's that say
I 'll cancel the reservation I found the name Zuul in The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects I do n't suppose you 've read it
Yes but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant
Is he dying or something
Who 's the stiff
I do n't have to take abuse from you I have other people dying to give it to me
You 're the best one in your row
Great rehearsal
Goodbye
All right
Then leave
I 'll scream
Out
That 's it Get out
All right What do you want to do
Thanks Coming from you that really means a lot to me
This is terrible Either there 's a monster in my kitchen or I 'm completely crazy
Yeah yeah
Damn
I told you I
I 'll wait here if you do n't mind
Uh-huh
What
Thanks What 's in there
No What do I act like
Yeah but it 's got a great cello break
I 'd have to say Prokofiev 's third concerto
You play the cello It 's my favorite instrument
Have you ever thought of moving out at least until this disturbance blows over
No just that one word Zuul but I have no idea what it means
Is that your professional opinion
Why would anyone make up a thing like that
and then I opened the door again but it was gone There was nothing there
We 're all professionals here Miss
Hello I 'm Peter Venkman May I help you
YAEGER Dr Venkman we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind You however seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable You 're a poor scientist Dr Venkman and you have no place in this department or in this University
YAEGER Fine This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group 's activities
YAEGER No we 're moving you OFF CAMPUS The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant You are to vacate these premises immediately
BUM That would definitely explain it
BUM You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street
BUM Well that definitely looks like marshmallow to me
BUM He 's a big one You do n't want to mess with that particular breed
We 'll get back to you
Back off man I 'm a scientist
One thing at a time We do n't even know what it is yet
Yes I 'm Dr Venkman and this is Dr Stantz
Thank you
I do n't believe in luck
What is it
That 's so romantic
In the physical sense
Egon there 's something very strange about that man I 'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you I 'm afraid you 're going to die
I think it 's the food of the future
I collect spores molds and fungus
Is that a game
Print is dead
Oh really Well I 've quit better jobs than this one believe me
I did n't ask him All I know is that I have n't had a break in two weeks and you promised you 'd hire more help
And someone from the EPA is here to see you
Here 's the paper on the Brooklyn job She paid with a Visa card
Why do n't you step into the office and we 'll talk about it Hold all my calls Janine
Heavens no The owners do n't like us to even talk about it I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight
Well most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor The disturbances I mean But it 's been quiet for years Up until two weeks ago It was never ever this bad though
Thank you for coming so quickly The guests are starting to ask questions and I 'm running out of excuses
That 's Peck
Probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the Army
See They are using drugs
Forget it Venkman You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me Now it 's my turn smart-ass
Hey Make yourself useful Go save a tree
Go ahead Get a court order Then I 'm gon na sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution
Why do you want to see it
The magic word is please
Because you did n't say the magic word
No you may not
Yes it would
In a storage facility
I 'm not at liberty to say
You could say that
I have Ph.D 's in psychology and parapsychology
Yes I 'm Doctor Venkman
Great How 's it going
Can I help you
I 'll tell you the effect It pisses me off
Yeah but I did n't know you were going to give me electric shocks What are you trying to prove
Hey I 'm getting a little tired of this
Two wavy lines
Yes I do n't like this
Close but definitely wrong
Good guess but no
All right What is it
On Earth no But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna
I could n't do that You might hurt someone
They 're not guns They 're particle throwers
When you were in the bathroom did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly
The wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating
Were you recently in the bathroom
But it 's my favorite state
No You said crossing the beams would be BAD It 'll kill her And us
On the count of three One Two
What now
You talked to Gozer
Who
Yes After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive And he was n't alone He had close to a thousand followers when he died They conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world
Of course Ivo Shandor I saw his name in Tobin 's SPIRIT GUIDE He started a secret society in 1920
Where 's the Keymaster
He wants to shut down the storage grid
I 'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning
You have to keep him there Do whatever you have to but do n't let him leave He could be very dangerous
Yeah yeah I was just thinking It probably would n't be a good idea for them to get together at this point
I do n't think so It 's more of that Gozer thing She says she 's the Gatekeeper Does that make any sense to you
I 'm with Dana Barrett and she 's floating three feet off the bed
It 's Peter Egon I 've got a problem
What do you mean bad
Why not
What
Yeah I can smell it
Did n't see anything Did n't get anything Nice girl no ghost I 'm starting to worry You said your graph was pointing to something big You told me things were going to start popping
She 's telling the truth or at least she thinks she is
Will you guys relax We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams
Wow
Spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost
Oh this is big Peter This is very big There 's definitely something here
Oh You 're here
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out
Look at the structure of the roof cap It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies
What happened
I need two new purge valves How 's the grid around the storage facility holding up
Neutronize System shut
Easy Easy I 'm going to throw in my trap now
God it 's ugly
We 'd better adjust our streams
I blame myself
Or even a race memory stored in the collective unconscious And I would n't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either
Great The marshmallows are about to get their revenge
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT
What What popped in there
Forget the trapping Just blast him
Well that ought to do it
I do n't think it 's Shandor
He 's listed on the blueprints as I Shandor
No Nobody ever built them like this The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy
It 's not good Pete
I ca n't take much more of this The pace is killing me
I do n't know I 'm just guessing
Do n't move It wo n't hurt you
Well hurry up The needle 's going wild
Third floor Get down here
Ray Something 's here
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy
Sure Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back No problem
So do I
They will
How was your date
Why do n't I check out the building It may have a history of psychic turbulence
Do you think it 's wide enough How much
This might do I do n't know it just seems kind of pricey for a fixer-upper do n't you think We 're trying to keep our costs down You know how it is when you 're starting a new company
Maybe But no one ever advertised before
But at nineteen percent interest You did n't even bargain with the guy
My parents left me that house I was born there
To go into business for ourselves
Let me tell you Ray everything in life happens for a reason Call it fate call it luck Karma whatever I think we were destined to get kicked out of there
You 're always so worried about your reputation We do n't need the University Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk 'They ca n't stop progress
Ray I apologize I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced They did this to Galileo too
Yeah but I introduced you guys You never would 've met if not for me That 's got to be worth something
If you guys are right if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow I think I could win the Nobel Prize
I guess I got a little overexcited Was n't it incredible I 'm telling you this is a first You know what this could mean to the University
Okay Okay I got it I know what to do Stay close I have a plan
Anything Just make contact
I do n't know Talk to it
I told you it 's real
What is it
Well I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once
What do you mean by seen
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years The graph we came up with definitely points to something big
Sure That 's great Ray I think you should get down there right away and check it out Let me know what happens
Excuse me for a minute Ray I 'm right in the middle of something here Can you come back in about an hour
What 's he talking about Choose what
Stantz You okay in there
You do n't have to worry about that with us sir
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world
Judgement Day
And the seas would boil
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy
No But I liked Jesus style
Boy Solid cores of shielded Selenium 325
Mmmhmmm
Uh Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett 's apartment building And they 're most unusual
Yeah I heard that Now tell me what you really do
What have I got now It 's exactly as if there were two emperors Because of this the people have two minds He is their champion
Damn him I should have killed him on the front I let you talk me out of that
Lykas pick a man Someone who will look good Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action
Not yet dear brother
You want control of the crowd you ca n't get it by killing their hero
You ca n't do that listen to the mood of the crowd
by the emperor of Rome This writer asks between a Senate that debates truth until they choke an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without
encased in the armor of a demigod Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast
If I ever loved Narcissus it was n't like you want
What are you talking about
The fans of Narcissus They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo They believe he 's dying
Why are you so surly you 've won brother The people have bread and the city is quiet
Taking my pleasure Do I need to clear my lovers with you
I have to come back If I do n't come back the people will think I 'm a coward Tribuus tomorrow he dies I want his blood on the sand Do you understand
Tribuus tomorrow
Kill him Tribuus execute that bastard
For the gods spit it out
How about in the forum Right in front of the Senate
It 's disgusting Animals I had to come here under armed guard Slaves get this junk out of my sight
Those are priceless sculptures
No one in Rome has ever heard of him Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with Forget about him
Did Narcissus die today Was n't this his day to die
I should at least have you do n't you think
They hate me they really hate me do n't they
Do n't you think you should at least wave
Quite so Narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve Rome
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed
I 'm tired of being stuck in that wagon
That 's what you told me two days ago
Where are we now Commodus Can you see the camp My Gods The air is turning into ice
Endorse me in public Do that and I 'll make you rich and set you free I 'll return your estates I know you would give anything to be outside again Endorse me and you will be free Think of it What would you do with your freedom
The army is a problem They love you You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you And after all you 're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty who could fault you for that Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate instead of executing you I 'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate I could have executed you
Apparently my opinion was n't needed
Forgive me Caesar but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people Besides every truce we make with the Germans they break
I 'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube
Caesar
You flatter me Caesar
Do we really need to repair this fort It seems like an expensive undertaking I propose we burn it to the ground That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position
The dangerous man Caesar is the man who does n't care
Oh but with the army behind you you could become extremely political Not a Republican by any chance
Or perhaps into a new one But here 's to your God and the courage of our legions
Then you 'd be out of a job
That 's difficult to say general
Of course but not now However if he continues to be unwell you may report to me
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas My father sends his heart felt praise Sadly Marcus is in dark humors nothing to worry about but he needs rest Likely just the weather
Caesar let me sponsor your first wager in the arena
Take grain away from the army
Give away food
So am I
Maybe it 'll crush Gaius
Throw it down into the streets Down into the Forum If it 's my father they want then give him to them
And like children everywhere they scream freedom the most when they desire it least I beg you please continue Caesar
Gods of hell This must cost a fortune How many days is this going to go on
Ignore that The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better
How can they Who else is there I have no heir
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory They will hear that you are living in luxury He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life And soon the army wo n't even remember your name
You do n't want to kill him If anything happens to him now you will be blamed and he knows it Besides that gladiator school is a fortress It would take the army to break in there What you want is to offer him the wooden sword If he takes it he 's no longer the champion of the people is he He 's gone And you are a hero for awarding it
It 's because he comes off as the underdog
This is the only place in Rome where I thought I believed I was wholly in power
We must obey our emperor and the Senate
Marcus Aurelius has died
Gladly Caesar And if you 'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light
Yes Caesar
Jerses tomorrow
Caesar I did my best The Colosseum is n't under my control
He must have been He was on the list of prisoners to be executed
Where is the emperor and the army soldier
You know there were riots last night Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division You understand what you are doing
AGH Please He 's having a secret device constructed for the circus The brass craftsmen are working overtime
Cos what in hades is the emperor up to And do n't tell me you do n't know
Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod Hercules has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens The Emperor 's going to fight in the arena I 'm supposed to write this for tomorrow 's edition
This is Cos this precocious young man A scribe for the Daily Action I 've invited him to write a small piece about you
Yes because I know they 'll read it
Proximo we need to talk about my one third I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business And what was the name of that olive oil company
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates He was born on August thirty-first you know
My birth sign is Water Bearer twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus
That 's their job is n't it To argue So I think my case will be long on talk and short on action
My only visits to Rome Senator have been through books But the war 's over time to close the door of war once and for all
I 've read of it
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory Thanks to Marcus Aurelius
The battle was won today and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus the eldest God of Rome God of my ancestors
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear If you are a friend to neither side legate you must be an enemy to both We needed to know what you believed
We all know what right is Senator
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes At the core he 's a man who believes in doing what 's right
I would venture with all respect the Emperor 's health is the business of every soul in the empire
You 're a citizen and a soldier Not a gladiator
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial You 'd have to give me your word
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial
Who are you Narcissus The Good I have heard of Narcissus Meridas That 's who I hear you are
Is this Rome Are we just going to be executed
Fools to let us both live we 'll be our own best witnesses at our trial
Why you
Hidden Where my brother can not place hands on them He did n't have the guts to watch them die so I took care of it all The sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe
Narcissus I have your family They 're alive All of them
Marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son
You can not die
If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads But
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman Read to sleep on Catullus Lucretius Virgil every night My beautiful daughters
Twenty years I 've led men to die For me it was the glory of Rome But that was something If it was n't that then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore but that was something These men here are butchered for laughs Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line
You mean a symbol of someone who does n't exist
Yours will do
Of course I know who do you think is paying for it The Emperor himself did n't you know Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front Burning patriotism Filial love He wants to be sure when he takes over there 's enough cash left in the treasury to play Emperor Watch out for him Narcissus he 's inexperienced but be careful
How do you know I am playing Well the clown is always harmless Is n't that right And how did you ever get to know me so well The last we spent any time together I was fourteen I think you know me better than my father He 's going to die is n't he
Why do you keep playing at being so humble It 's a little embarrassing
Without him He 'd be weeping if he overheard that Well The idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities
You know our two most senior Senators Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus
No future-telling please I 've been terrified enough for one day
AURELIUS They fear change The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible You could be the one the Emperor the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic
AURELIUS The Senators admire you
AURELIUS A man should be upright not be kept upright History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute I want you to consider becoming my heir
AURELIUS Everyone talking about it I would n't wonder All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate Thus I have transferred legal power which was theirs to begin with back to the Senators This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan It 's a start only a start If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share This means Commodus has to bend does he strike you as that type
AURELIUS It 's not because he 's young it 's because he 's ignorant and arrogant His sister is a better man That 's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate
AURELIUS If I 'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have no again it 's my own bullheadedness Narcissus I should have adopted you years ago And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son
AURELIUS Servis made it through again
AURELIUS I 've made so many mistakes Narcissus We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we 're afraid of admitting when our lives are over
AURELIUS I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they 're most vulnerable
On my honor as your daddy
As soon as I can
Do n't stop to visit take the children straight home and I 'll follow as soon as I can
I made the plume from a quail feather
What are you fighting for in here The good of Rome I can end this madness now Take the job for the sake of the Gods live
Then give the empire back to the people the children who will grow up to become senators
Quintus you 've got at least a division with you we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate
It 's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons
You brought the army into Rome
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here The Senate may be vacillating but I have the army behind me I 'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort
My troops do n't make policy
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal
Serious stuff
Why do n't we try to keep politics out of the conversation
What the hell was all that about
I see the emperor 's little boy has finally caught up with the army
You teach them
Your daughters need more than some vapors they need you
I do n't want you to die
Narcissus
You 're not going You have to stay with us
When you get to Ostia use this bribe passage to Africa or Spain Save my family You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia
I do n't even want to imagine the things you 've seen
I never knew a more idealistic man than you
Let him trust Quintus
We do n't need your help we 're doing great on our own
Who else I 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome Or for the glory of you
I 've been overseeing production myself for the past three years you 'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become
If you win you know you have to stay It 's the losers who get to go home Besides I 'm not so sure it is over Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines
I can see that
Of course
What about their philosophy lessons
Greeks
Is n't the helmet magnificent
Are you mad With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night Anyway I 'm not political I 'm in the entertainment business
Something else then Do the chariot races interest you
Let 's talk about this later Right now we have other things to settle You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia From there Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum It 's beautiful an old Greek town right on the ocean Rich soil Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it 's always good to look to the future keep your hand in the arena so to speak
You were a soldier and then a gladiator were n't you
I 'll do it Sure as there 's shit in the Tiber we 're all going to die but for you anything
Right right what am I thinking of
Right right But they 'll have to bring in a lawyer I do n't want to get sued over this
Fantastic Wonderful But posters are very expensive
I can really rape them on this Can I at least tell them you 'll think about it
A great deal They designed and build Tiger 's chariot
Oh shit Take your time Do n't get suckered This man is a murderer In his career he 's killed over a thousand gladiators Please just take the fall
On you Of course You are my bravest fighter the best fighter I have ever seen
It 's absolutely not like that This is for your own good Come on get the rest of your armor on
But you have to go out there I 'll give you more than your one third When I get paid just take the fall You 're too hurt to fight and the man 's a killer
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life
You get to come alive again in the country
You put this inside your shirt when Tiger stabs your stomach it 's full of pig 's blood Gushes out everywhere It 's really impressive Fantastic Better than the real thing
Tiger 's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer you take a fall
No more bad luck now The people are anticipating you I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior the true Roman The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna he was crushed by an elephant
Proximo if this is her doctor he 's an assassin
General hang on drink slowly You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight A fan sent them to you
What would the poster say Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil
That 's one way to look at it
General do you realize what happened out there today
I 'm not a gladiator I refuse to fight
to fight We 'll see
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I wo n't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here I know what you 're trying to do kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you 're a very important individual You make me feel good about my investment And that puking pig Jerses he wo n't even discuss you Both of you have clamped mouths But I love all my fighters I 'll find out about your family And about you That I promise
Take your hands off me animal
Death is a very light thing for you
Thank you What is going to happen tomorrow Exactly
General all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen
I am the man who might save your life give you a bit more life at any rate I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me I own this school and everything that 's in it You 're in it But why What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum Understand we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets Please I separated you from the others because my nose tells me you 've been condemned for important reasons
I 'm a Greek thank you And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white Relax tell me everything I 'm your friend
You 're a legate in the Roman army Huh and you act like one What was your crime
Benjamin
The day after tomorrow
Are we getting married tomorrow
Shhhh
He said he thought we 'd make a pretty good team
No Benjamin
Well I said I might marry him
Yes
Carl Smith He 's a medical student We 've known him for years
Carl who
Why do n't I just drag you off All right I will Right after we get the blood tests
I just do n't think it would
Why would n't it
We 'll need our Birth Certificates I happen to have mine with me Where 's yours
Or this afternoon It 's a good day for it
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow
You really will

ROBINSON I did n't mean it I do n't think you 'd be right for each other But I would never say you were n't as good a person as she is
ROBINSON Benjamin I want to apologize to you if that 's the impression you got
ROBINSON Did I say that
ROBINSON Do n't you expect me to be a little hurt

No sir I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic
Well I 'm not
You go to hell You go straight to hell Mrs Robinson Do you think I 'm proud of myself Do you think I 'm proud of this
I 'm good enough for you but I 'm too slimy to associate with your daughter That 's it is n't it IS N'T IT
We 're not dropping it Now that 's the reason is n't it I 'm a dirty degenerate are n't I I 'm not fit to

ROBINSON How about art
Mrs Robinson If that 's the best we can do let 's just get the goddamn clothes off and

SINGLEMAN I 'd like you to know my sister Miss DeWitte
We have n't
About an hour ago
No they do n't
BRADDOCK Oh Ben this is so exciting
BRADDOCK then I 'll simply invite all the Robinsons over for dinner on Thursday
BRADDOCK Do n't go on like this Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out
BRADDOCK It 's pretty embarrassing I really do n't know what to tell Mr Robinson It 's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine
But I want you to Please Please will you believe me
BRADDOCK No
BRADDOCK Goodnight Benjamin
BRADDOCK But I do n't want you to make up something
BRADDOCK Not if you do n't want to
BRADDOCK Because I know you do n't drive around for twelve hours
Well wait
I do n't meet anyone mother but why did you say that
BRADDOCK Well this is your business Benjamin If you
Meet someone
Oh no
Nothing else
I drive around
BRADDOCK You do n't have to tell me if you do n't want
BRADDOCK Well I 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night
BRADDOCK Benjamin I 'm going to ask you something but you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want
BRADDOCK Can I talk to you a minute
BRADDOCK Say hello to Mrs Robinson Benjamin
BRADDOCK Ben this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked
BRADDOCK She does n't know that you 're coming up to Berkeley
BRADDOCK Wait a minute You talked to Elaine this morning
BRADDOCK Come on let 's call the Robinsons We 've got something to celebrate
BRADDOCK Say that again
That has nothing to do with it
Look Elaine Robinson and I do not get along
BRADDOCK Now listen Ben I think it 's a very good thing that a young man after he 's done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass
BRADDOCK Would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for What was the point of all that hard work
BRADDOCK Have you thought about graduate school
BRADDOCK Why
BRADDOCK To be what
BRADDOCK What about it
BRADDOCK About what
BRADDOCK worried
ROBINSON I think I 've talked about this enough I do n't know how far I can go Ben I do n't know if I can prosecute or not but I think maybe I can In the light of what 's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure
ROBINSON Well I 'm sure you think you do Ben but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you 'd get over that as quickly as you
ROBINSON Do n't shout at me Ben
ROBINSON Shaking hands Well that 's not saying much for my wife is it
ROBINSON That 's quite a statement
ROBINSON Why
ROBINSON Well I do n't think we have a whole lot to say to each other Ben I do think you should know the consequences of what you 've done I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon
ROBINSON You do n't respect me terribly much either do you
ROBINSON Do you want to unclench your fists please Thank you I can see in the dark you know I 've been here quite a while
ROBINSON Ben I think we 're two civilized human beings Do you think it 's necessary to threaten each other
ROBINSON Well Ben it was quite a bit to do with me
ROBINSON Is there something I 've said that 's caused this contempt Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise
ROBINSON Do you have a special grudge against me Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me
ROBINSON Do you want do you want to try and tell me why you did it
ROBINSON What would you say to a short one Bourbon still your drink
ROBINSON Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together
ROBINSON That 's what I 'd do if I could Nothing wrong with that Hey Ben Elaine 's coming down from Berkeley soon I want you to call her up this time
ROBINSON Hi Ben What are you doing with yourself these days
I will
Oh yes
ROBINSON What You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off Does n't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off
ROBINSON You have yourself a few flings this summer I bet you 're quite a ladies man

Yes sir

Wherever you like Here I 'll give you the money I won three thousand four hundred Later you can have more
You 'll have a good time with me Want to I 've got enough money Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook Three thousand four hundred that I won It will last a long time I can win more we 'll travel
Of course I do I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it Do you know I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing I 'll take care of you Will will you let me
Yes of course money
Then why did you have anything to do with him
He was in desperate straits He 'd been trying to raise money all day He laughed Poor devil And then a man like Preysing kills him
So did I He was friendly to me as no man ever was
You loved the Baron did n't you
What 's the matter
Quick something awful awful has happened Go go at once Mr Preysing
Oh what what
You do n't like to see me enjoying myself
For the first time in my life I 'm happy

I 'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste distinctive do n't you think Velvet upholstery A-number one I 'm in the textile trade and I know And these are real silk drapes
You are funny You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch
Have caviar if you like but it tastes like herring to me

Moreover
You pay me
No only occasional jobs
Moreover
Moreover
Then you will please wait outside
What
What we want to know about is Manchester
Oh ho you want legal aid against us The whole thing seems to me to be very simple
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company but if they have n't they 're ruined Preysing will have to declare himself
And ask me what it 's costing us to hammer it down
See you soon Preysing Next week we 'll meet and discuss further details
Under these circumstances it 's quite a different matter
Preysing you 're joking with us
If you actually have news from Manchester then
What
Goodbye Preysing I hope you pull through This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis We 've
Then it 's all over
You 've decided against the merger
What
Evil days I 've shown you here my company exports to the Balkans alone sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year
I know you did I said you did
Scratched We did not take the initiative
We did not approach you
Now to proceed with the projected merger the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious
No water What a place
I 'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz before I commit myself
I 'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern Active capital plant and machinery raw material and finished product for instance mop rags
Since on the eleventh of June this year when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages
We are here to discuss our merger Naturally I can make no statement at this time We must begin at the beginning
We have a good many connections in England naturally
Manchester yes Yes yes they do Yes Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning Have we cigars water and everything
What
Here 's my signature here Preysing sign here
Mr Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties
and let me say again for the tenth time you people were quite ready for the merger You declared yourselves fully agreed on all the terms Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up
As you remember it when you approached us
Since on the eleventh of June of this year when the first negotiations for a merger
How clear is Manchester
You 're a deep one
You see what we are interested in
Shall I tell them again

Pretty as a picture
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock she was in a hurry
What do you want with her
I can understand that after your uh
What you need is some relaxation
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through
'Deal with Manchester definitely off Preysing oh I 'd never have thought it of you
What 's bluff
What 's the matter with you
Next week
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time
Oh here you are Justice Zinnowitz I 'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen will you clear up the situation
Good night
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow I ca n't speak without notes I like to have things down before me in black and white
Yes the merger must go through But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis I am not a liar I am an honest business man a good husband and father I have a sense of honor I have nothing to conceal I could n't live happily otherwise
No news from Manchester yet Do you think we ought to postpone the conference

Motherhood
What the fuck are you doin with a son
Your what
You wan na talk to me straight up
Now I 'll ask you another You think I got no contacts out here That nag paid off at just the opening price There was n't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted There ai n't enough action to tickle the tote but you claim a ten grand win You send me ten thousand dollars like I 'm some mark you can blow off
One question Do you want to stick to that story or do you want to keep your teeth
You 're fuckin right you 're not How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag huh Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me
How 'd you figure you were gon na get away with that
Well I guess so You 're the guy I work for
Hi Bobo
And I 'll want to leave an early wake-up call
Right in front of the room
I 'll put you in one thirty-one Very quiet Faces the desert
Those trucks I know exactly what you mean
Oh everything 's the same size same price
Evening Welcome to Phoenix
Come on kid let 's see if there 's any food in the house
The kids beat him up because his home life is uh different
Your kid 's in the back here He 's crying
Demon Demon That 's why you can walk on it Demon
It 's just the strain again the stress We 'll take a vacation
Cole it 'll be all right Honey
You ruined me You destroyed me
Come take a look An entire-suite of main-frame computer
Want a look
So here we are
Oh I know I know and you 've been wonderful since I was widowed But Mister Hebbing has you do n't mind my telling him darling suffered reverses If he could
Henry next time could n't Mister Hebbing
Well I 'll have to take your word for it Mary Beth Here 's your money
Mary Beth I hope you are n't spreading this good news too widely
Mary Beth what we have here uh
I must admit Mister Fellowes I had moments I was worried
These machines They 're in here
We have to be ready We have to have the money and we have to know what the information means and we have to move immediately
Every once in a while a major change comes through We have seven seconds to take advantage put our buy order our sell order into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in
You 're right And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange He can give us when it 's really useful a seven second delay in that movement of information Do you know what that means
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us New York one hour behind There is n't one hour of the day when both are open Information moves but it has to wait Now we have a young fellow working here Do you know what a hacker is Mister Hebbing
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about
And I do n't just mean the SEC We could have the FBI breathing down our necks
My son will be all right If he is n't I 'll have you killed
You know who I work for
Well make it stop
What He 's going to be all right
Maybe I 'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way
I know
Delmar I never go out to California That 's a thousand miles from here
You are seeing it You 're looking right at it
I have only one thing now Are you interested
It 's not your fault
I 'll get you a check
Why of course it is I can offer you well five hundred dollars
Glass will cut glass Mrs Langtry Do you know where it was purchased
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I 've ever seen But the stones no They 're not diamonds Mrs Langtry
I ca n't understand a thing like this It 's something you almost never see
You are a valued customer as you know
Mrs Langtry I 'm sorry
That 's what we 'll do then But I tell you what Roy Before I hire anybody else I 'll ask you one last time Fair enough
Well Roy if that 's the way you feel I wo n't badger you Do n't want to lose you as a salesman too
A well-rounded life I respect that But it has to have a center Roy something you care about something you can think about
Perk remember
Oh come on Roy
You 're turning me down Makes no sense Roy
Good to have you back Roy I was just looking at
And I 'm Perk Short for Percy I 'm afraid
See you in a week Roy I can call you Roy
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department Things 've gone to hell this long they can go a little longer
I did n't realize Yeah you do look a little pale How soon will you be ready A week
No
That 's just the first year If you are n't worth a lot more than that the second year I 'll kick you out What do you say
I do n't know offhand what your best year 's been we can look it up The idea is we 'll top it by fifteen percent
That 's right you 've had to supervise yourself This place needs a sales manager Somebody who 's proved he 's a salesman and can handle other salesmen He 'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out new men to hire What do you think
Makes no difference to me if they 're only on commission If they do n't make good money they 're not giving us good representation and we ca n't afford to have them around Ever supervise salesmen
When I said you being the best salesman here did n't say much I meant for us I know your record with Sarber and Webb and I 'd say you 're a top-flight man but you 've had no incentive No one walking on your heels Just a lot of half asses so the tendency 's been not to stretch yourself I 'm bouncing the slobs incidentally
You 're right I apologize But I still want to talk to you
What 's up
Roy Dillon
Hello
NO
Lilly Jesus what are you doing
There 's nothing more to talk about
Roy What if I told you I was n't really your mother That we were n't related

A future The only future I 've got
Oh that 's it You 're stealing my money for my own good How very motherly of you Lilly

No but I 'm goddamn thirsty Ice water
You want a drink
And to survive my way I need money Bobo knows about the stash in the car so I did n't dare touch it not if Lilly Dillon 's dead So that leaves this
Bobo is n't after you Bobo 's after me and he 's goddamn good But so am I I 'm a survivor Roy I survive

Just a few bucks
I need this Roy I ca n't run without money and if I ca n't run I 'm dead
I 'm sorry I hated to take your money but
It is is n't it And maybe it 's a break for me after all I 've been wanting out of the racket for years and now I 'm out I can make a clean start and
I sat in there with her I thought what do I do now Run and I 've got Bobo and the law after me Stay and how do I explain
As though you do what I say
No you would n't That 's what she was after though But why hit on me
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo I guess to get me running Did you tell her about my stash
Even so You still got time Relax a minute tell me what happened Sit down
Why should they The cops are satisfied
You 're dead Lilly it worked
Looks very solid Lilly Sit down Take a minute tell me about it

You do n't put up with that Nobody has to put up with that
Lucky You call that lucky
Bluebell came in
The first day of the Delmar meet there was a nag called Bluebell I should have been on it But that was the day after you came in here so I stuck around to see how you were gon na be
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus back in Baltimore When a long shot gets too much action I have to put money on that horse at the track because it 's the only way to get the odds down

You watch that mouth
What 's that
What
I 'm happy the way I am
No history Sooner or later the lightning hits I do n't want to be around when it hits you
Mostly because you scare the shit out of me I 've seen people like you before baby Double-tough and sharp as they come and you get what you want or else But you do n't make it work forever
What I say is no We do n't do partners
That 's what I say
Do n't I get any say in this
You 're too good for the small-time Roy Move up to where there 's big dough to be made and you do n't have to stick your neck out every day
But the setup 's there It 's there now
What
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa the one who plays my chauffeur There 's a sucker there he says is made for us And a boroker that just shut down we can use their office not change a thing Now I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end We could start this weekend get the sucker into position
Yes or no They 're both easier at home Okay
Come on Myra do n't talk business here This is time out
Regret what I did n't say I was coming aboard
Running your broker scam you mean
You must have some very knowledgeable friends
She did n't see you in other words
The track Did you run into Lilly
You were gone for a while
If you could have seen your face when I told you good night You looked so so Ah

No no He never calls the cops not after we give him the blow-off
No no Roy just cash poor They had savings accounts stocks to sell houses to mortgage Sell their wife 's jewelry Oh they had a lot of money when they put their minds to it Or when I put their minds to it I stayed with them that 's the roper 's job made them get up every penny they could raise turn it all over to Cole
He 'd explain he had to have cash so there would n't be any paper trail for the SEC And a lot of cash or it was n't worth while The least we ever took was forty thousand and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars From one sucker
He did n't think they were risks He was so good Roy he could just play with the mark
Is that right

Nobody does that single-o
You talk the lingo What 's your pitch
